    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum, commonly known as ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Ryegrass is often found in disturbed soils and is a common weed in agricultural fields. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
