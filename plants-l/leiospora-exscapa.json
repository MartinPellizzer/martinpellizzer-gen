    "intro": "Leiospora exscapa, commonly known as the creeping leiospora, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, releasing spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leiospora exscapa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
