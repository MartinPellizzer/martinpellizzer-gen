    "intro": "Lomariocycas longipinna, commonly known as the long-needle cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomariocycas longipinna is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation laws."
