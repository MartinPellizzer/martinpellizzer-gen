It is characterized by its unique combination of fibrous and woody tissues, which contribute to its structural strength. The plant typically features broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in terminal spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
