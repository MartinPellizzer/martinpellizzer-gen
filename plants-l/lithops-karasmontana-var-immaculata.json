It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, often resembling small stones or rocks. The plant's leaves are typically pale green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer. This variety is particularly prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
