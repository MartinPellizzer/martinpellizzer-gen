    "intro": "Leachiella sociarum, commonly known as the social leachiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leachiella sociarum is considered a species of conservation concern."
