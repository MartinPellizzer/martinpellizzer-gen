    "intro": "Lepanthes silvae, commonly known as the forest violet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within dense forests. The plant features delicate, spurred flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Lepanthes silvae is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
