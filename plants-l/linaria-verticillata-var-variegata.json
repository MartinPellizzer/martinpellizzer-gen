    "intro": "Linaria verticillata var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive orange or red throat. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and often have a variegated pattern of green and white, which adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
