    "intro": "Lagenocarpus guianensis var. paraensis, commonly known as the Guianan sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically features hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are small, clustered, and often pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as riverbanks and savannas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
