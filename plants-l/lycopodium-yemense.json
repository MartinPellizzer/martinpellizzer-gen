    "intro": "Lycopodium yemense, commonly known as the Ethiopian clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of forests in its native range. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, a feature common to many primitive vascular plants. Lycopodium yemense plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
