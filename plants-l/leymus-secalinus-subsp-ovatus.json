    "intro": "Leymus secalinus subsp. ovatus, commonly known as the ovate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. This plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
