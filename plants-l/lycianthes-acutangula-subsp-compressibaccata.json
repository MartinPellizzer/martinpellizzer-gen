It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a hairy surface. Its flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive purple calyx, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields."
