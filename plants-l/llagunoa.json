    "intro": "Llagunoa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Llagunoa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
