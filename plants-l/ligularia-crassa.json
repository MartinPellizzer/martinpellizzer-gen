    "intro": "Ligularia crassa, commonly known as the broadleaf ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, sturdy stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its robust growth makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
