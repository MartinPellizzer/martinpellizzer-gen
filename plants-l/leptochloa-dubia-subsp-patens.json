    "intro": "Leptochloa dubia subsp. patens, commonly known as the coastal arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in tidal zones and dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is of interest for its ecological and potential horticultural value."
