    "intro": "Lindera camphorata, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, lantern-shaped berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lindera camphorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
