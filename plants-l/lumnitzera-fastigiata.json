    "intro": "Lumnitzera fastigiata, commonly known as the mangrove shrub or red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its dense, tangled root system known as pneumatophores, which help in gas exchange and anchoring in soft mud. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, oval fruits that contain a single seed. Lumnitzera fastigiata plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
