    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. rivasii, commonly known as the Rivas' Bird's-foot Trefoil, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its geographic distribution and genetic diversity."
