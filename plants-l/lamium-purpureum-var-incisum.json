    "intro": "Lamium purpureum var. incisum, commonly known as red deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces spikes of tubular, pinkish-red flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers attract bees and other pollinators, contributing to ecological biodiversity. It is also sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
