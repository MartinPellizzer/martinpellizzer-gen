    "intro": "Lepidium panniforme, commonly known as the creeping cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and covered in tiny, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed pods that release tiny seeds when mature."
