    "intro": "Ligularia dux var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf heartleaf arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the forests of China. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive white margin and a deep green central vein. The plant produces striking, arrowhead-shaped spadices with yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Due to its compact size, it is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a container plant."
