    "intro": "Leucopogon stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pink or white and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The narrow, leathery leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited to its often arid or nutrient-poor environment."
