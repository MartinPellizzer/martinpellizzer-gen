    "intro": "Lactuca cataonica, commonly known as the Crimean lettuce, is a species of lettuce native to the Caucasus and parts of southern Europe. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which are followed by slender, elongated seed pods. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Lactuca cataonica is valued both for its culinary use and its role in traditional medicine."
