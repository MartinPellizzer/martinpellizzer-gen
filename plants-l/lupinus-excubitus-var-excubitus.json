    "intro": "Lupinus excubitus var. excubitus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial legume native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, pinnately compound leaves, and spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions through its deep root system. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive member of the Fabaceae family."
