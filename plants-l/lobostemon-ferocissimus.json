It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
