    "intro": "Lindera aggregata var. playfairii, commonly known as the Playfair's spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees, and is characterized by its aromatic, slightly citrus-scented leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and growth habits compared to the typical form of Lindera aggregata."
