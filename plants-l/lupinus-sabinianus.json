    "intro": "Lupinus sabinianus, commonly known as the Sabin's lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus sabinianus is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation and supports local pollinator populations."
