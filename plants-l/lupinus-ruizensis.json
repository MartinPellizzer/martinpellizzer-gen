    "intro": "Lupinus ruizensis, commonly known as the Ruins Mountain lupine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Lupinus ruizensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
