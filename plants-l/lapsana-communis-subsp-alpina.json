    "intro": "Lapsana communis subsp. alpina, commonly known as alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its yellow ray florets and dark brown disk florets are prominent features, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Lapsana communis."
