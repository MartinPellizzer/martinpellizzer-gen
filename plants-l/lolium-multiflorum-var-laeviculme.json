    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. laeviculme, commonly known as ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often used in forage and turfgrass applications due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value. The variety laeviculme is distinguished by its smooth, slightly compressed leaf surfaces and compact growth form."
