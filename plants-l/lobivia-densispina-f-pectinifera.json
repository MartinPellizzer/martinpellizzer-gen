It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense, white spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. This cultivar is prized for its unique appearance and is often grown in rock gardens or as a container plant."
