    "intro": "Lindsaea flabellulata var. multipinnulata, commonly known as the fan-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in specialized leaflets called sporophylls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is distinguished by its multiple pinnae, which contribute to its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
