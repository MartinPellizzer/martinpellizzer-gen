    "intro": "Leptinella traillii, commonly known as the Traill's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
