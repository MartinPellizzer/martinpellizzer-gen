    "intro": "Lantana depressa, commonly known as the prostrate lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spreading habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces vibrant clusters of yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. Lantana depressa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
