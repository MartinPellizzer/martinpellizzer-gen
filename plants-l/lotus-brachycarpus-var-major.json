    "intro": "Lotus brachycarpus var. major, commonly known as the Indian lotus, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water, and its flowers are typically pink or red, blooming on long, erect stems. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize water bodies. The lotus is also notable for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
