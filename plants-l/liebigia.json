    "intro": "Liebigia, commonly known as the \"peacock flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its showy, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often with a woody stem and broad, palmate leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the vibrant bracts serve as its primary ornamental feature. Liebigia species are valued in horticulture for their striking appearance and are often cultivated in warm climates."
