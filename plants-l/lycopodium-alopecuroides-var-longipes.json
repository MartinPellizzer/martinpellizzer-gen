    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters at the tips of the stems, which release spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its longer stems compared to other varieties of Lycopodium alopecuroides."
