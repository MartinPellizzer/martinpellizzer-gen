    "intro": "Licaria tenuicarpa, commonly known as the slender-fruited licaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Licaria tenuicarpa is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
