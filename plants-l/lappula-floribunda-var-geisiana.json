    "intro": "Lappula floribunda var. geisiana, commonly known as the alpine lappula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh climates and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
