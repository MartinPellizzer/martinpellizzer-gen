It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Lupinus gracilis is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
