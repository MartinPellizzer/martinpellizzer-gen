The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
