    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. typicum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the sporangia for reproduction. Its leaves are scale-like and tightly packed, giving it a pine-like appearance, hence its common name. Lycopodium selago var. typicum is often found in rocky or forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role."
