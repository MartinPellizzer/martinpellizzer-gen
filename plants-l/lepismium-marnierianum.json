    "intro": "Lepismium marnierianum, commonly known as the Marnier's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent petals that resemble spectral forms. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
