    "intro": "Leucheria arancioi, commonly known as the orange leucheria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
