    "intro": "Lonicera dioica, commonly known as twinberry honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its red berries, which appear in late summer, are edible and attract birds. Lonicera dioica thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
