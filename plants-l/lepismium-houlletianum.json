    "intro": "Lepismium houlletianum, commonly known as the Houllet's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces fragrant, white or pale pink blooms during the warmer months. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
