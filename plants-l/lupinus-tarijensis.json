It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spicate inflorescences of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus tarijensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its seeds are often used as forage for livestock and have potential for ecological restoration projects."
