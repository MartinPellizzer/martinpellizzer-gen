It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of Thailand and Malaysia. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
