    "intro": "Lastrea articulata, commonly known as the glasswort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is adapted to absorb and tolerate high concentrations of salt. Lastrea articulata is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats."
