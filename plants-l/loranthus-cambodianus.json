    "intro": "Loranthus cambodianus, commonly known as the Cambodian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a waxy surface, adapted to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, Loranthus cambodianus is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
