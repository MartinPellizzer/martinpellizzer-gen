    "intro": "Larnax altomayoensis, commonly known as the Altomayo larnax, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Larnaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist climate to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Larnax altomayoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
