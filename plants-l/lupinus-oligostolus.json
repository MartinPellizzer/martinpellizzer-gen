    "intro": "Lupinus oligostolus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy, and it produces elongated seed pods that contain several small, dark seeds. Lupinus oligostolus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
