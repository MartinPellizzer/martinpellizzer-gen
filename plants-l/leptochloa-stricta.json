    "intro": "Leptochloa stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats or tufts, with fine, silvery-green foliage that is often covered in a whitish bloom. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Leptochloa stricta is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as fields and woodland edges."
