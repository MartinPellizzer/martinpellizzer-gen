    "intro": "Lycaste macrophylla, commonly known as the giant night-blooming orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and glossy, contributing to its lush, tropical appearance. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
