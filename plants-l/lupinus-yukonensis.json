    "intro": "Lupinus yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and grasslands. Lupinus yukonensis is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
