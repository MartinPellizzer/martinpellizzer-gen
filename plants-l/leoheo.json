    "intro": "Leoheo, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nymphaeaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a wide range of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, and requires full sun exposure. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The Leoheo has cultural and symbolic significance, often representing purity and rebirth in various ancient traditions."
