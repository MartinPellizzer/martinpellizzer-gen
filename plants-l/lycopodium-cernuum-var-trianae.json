    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. trianae, commonly known as the Triana's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, erect, evergreen stems that are often covered in a dense layer of scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia responsible for releasing spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its morphological distinctiveness and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
