    "intro": "Loranthus raoulii, commonly known as the Raouli's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ecological role includes supporting biodiversity through seed dispersal and providing habitat for various organisms."
