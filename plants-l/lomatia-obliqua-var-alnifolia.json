    "intro": "Lomatia obliqua var. alnifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomatia, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and heathland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
