    "intro": "Loxanthera loxanthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandplain aster, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom during the cooler months. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Loxanthera loxanthera is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
