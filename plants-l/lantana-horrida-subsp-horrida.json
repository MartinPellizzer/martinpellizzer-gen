It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
