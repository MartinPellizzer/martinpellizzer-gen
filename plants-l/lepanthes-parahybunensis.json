    "intro": "Lepanthes parahybunensis, commonly known as the Parahyba orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically feature a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Lepanthes parahybunensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
