    "intro": "Lanigerostemma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
