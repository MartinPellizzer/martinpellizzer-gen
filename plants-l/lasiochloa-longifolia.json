    "intro": "Lasiochloa longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that are typically elongated and slightly curved. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
