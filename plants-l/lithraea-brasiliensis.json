    "intro": "Lithraea brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds."
