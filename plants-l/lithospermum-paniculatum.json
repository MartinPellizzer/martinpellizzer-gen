    "intro": "Lithospermum paniculatum, commonly known as red root, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically pink to red in hue. Its roots are rich in lithospermic acid, a compound with historical use in traditional medicine. Lithospermum paniculatum thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with well-drained soil."
