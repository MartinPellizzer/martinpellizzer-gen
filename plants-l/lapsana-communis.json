    "intro": "Lapsana communis, commonly known as common nosewort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with slender, branched stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. Lapsana communis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it has been introduced to other regions as an invasive species."
