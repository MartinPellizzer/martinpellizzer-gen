    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus var. paucijugus, commonly known as the Balkan vetch, is a perennial legume native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along forest edges. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
