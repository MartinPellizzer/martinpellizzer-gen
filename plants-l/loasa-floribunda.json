It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture. Loasa floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
