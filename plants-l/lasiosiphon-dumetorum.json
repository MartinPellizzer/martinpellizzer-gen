    "intro": "Lasiosiphon dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with five petals and a prominent central tube. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lasiosiphon dumetorum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats."
