    "intro": "Lippia palmeri var. spicata, commonly known as Palmer's lippia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with aromatic, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural use."
