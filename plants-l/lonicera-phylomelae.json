It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb by twining around supports. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
