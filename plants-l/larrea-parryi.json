    "intro": "Larrea parryi, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Larrea parryi is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas."
