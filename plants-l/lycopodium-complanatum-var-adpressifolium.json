    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. adpressifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the ground, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its slow growth and ability to form extensive carpets in suitable habitats."
