    "intro": "Litsea concolor, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, elliptic leaves that are usually glossy green on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, posing ecological challenges."
