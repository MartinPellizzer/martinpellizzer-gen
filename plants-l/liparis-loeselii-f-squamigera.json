    "intro": "Liparis loeselii f. squamigera, commonly known as the squamigera orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring broad, overlapping leaf-like bracts that resemble scales, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
