    "intro": "Leymus laxinodis, commonly known as the red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often exhibit a reddish hue, especially in the inflorescence. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with the lower florets often being sterile, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Leymus laxinodis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
