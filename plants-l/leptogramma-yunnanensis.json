    "intro": "Leptogramma yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan leptogramma, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Leptogramma yunnanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
