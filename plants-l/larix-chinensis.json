    "intro": "Larix chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before falling off. The tree produces cones that disperse seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stress. This species is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its timber and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
