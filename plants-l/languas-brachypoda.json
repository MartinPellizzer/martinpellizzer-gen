    "intro": "Languas brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Languas brachypoda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
