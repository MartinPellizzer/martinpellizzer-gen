    "intro": "Lathyrus stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain several small, brown seeds. Lathyrus stenophyllus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
