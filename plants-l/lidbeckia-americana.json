    "intro": "Lidbeckia americana, commonly known as the American lidbeckia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall, often branching near the base. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Lidbeckia americana is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
