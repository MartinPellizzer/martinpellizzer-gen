It features opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. Ligustrina amurensis is also valued for its ability to thrive in urban environments and tolerate pollution."
