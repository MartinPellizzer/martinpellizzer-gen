    "intro": "Lindera glabrata, commonly known as smooth ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, elliptical leaves that are smooth and dark green on top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, and it has a tendency to spread through rhizomes, forming dense thickets. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
