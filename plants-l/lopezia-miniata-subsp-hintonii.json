    "intro": "Lopezia miniata subsp. hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. This plant is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
