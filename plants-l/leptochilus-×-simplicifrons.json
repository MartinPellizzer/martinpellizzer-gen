    "intro": "Leptochilus \u00d7 simplicifrons, commonly known as the simple-fruited rockcress, is a hybrid species within the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and basal rosette of leaves, with small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers have four petals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
