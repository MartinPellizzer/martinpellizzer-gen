    "intro": "Lupinus subacaulis, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces spikes of bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Lupinus subacaulis is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules, making it an important plant for soil enrichment."
