    "intro": "Leontodon parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered toothache plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces achenes as its seeds. The plant is known for its historical use in treating toothaches, though its medicinal properties are not widely studied today."
