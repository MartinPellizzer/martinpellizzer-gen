    "intro": "Lygodium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrulate fern, is a tropical climbing fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that twine around supporting structures. The plant has pinnate leaves with serrated margins, giving it its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Lygodium serrulatum is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
