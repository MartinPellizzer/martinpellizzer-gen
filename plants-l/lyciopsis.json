    "intro": "Lyciopsis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many species of vines and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning, often in shades of yellow or white. Its leaves are typically alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Lyciopsis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources."
