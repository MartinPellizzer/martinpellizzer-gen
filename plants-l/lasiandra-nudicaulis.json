    "intro": "Lasiandra nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed lily, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are often hairless, hence the species name \"nudicaulis.\" The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with six petals and a distinct throat. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Lasiandra nudicaulis thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, well-drained soils."
