    "intro": "Lunaria annua f. orbiculata, commonly known as the orbiculate moonflower, is a variant of the moonflower plant characterized by its distinctive, rounded seed pods. This plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late summer and early autumn. The orbiculata form is distinguished by its nearly spherical seed pods, which contrast with the more elongated pods of the typical variety.
