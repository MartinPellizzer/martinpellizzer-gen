    "intro": "Lamyra bulgarensis, commonly known as the Bulgarian lamyra, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Bulgaria. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Lamyra bulgarensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
