    "intro": "Lilium bulbiferum var. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that display a unique bicolor pattern, typically featuring a white or pale pink base with a deep red or orange center. The plant produces bulbous structures called bulbils, which can be used for propagation, making it relatively easy to cultivate. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. This variety is valued for its vibrant blooms and adaptability to a range of growing conditions."
