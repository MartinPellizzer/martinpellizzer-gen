    "intro": "Lycopodioides somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Native to the arid regions of Somalia, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
