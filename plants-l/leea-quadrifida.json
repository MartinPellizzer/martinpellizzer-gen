    "intro": "Leea quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leafed leea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that often have four lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Leea quadrifida is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical uses remain under scientific investigation."
