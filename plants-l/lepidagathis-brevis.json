    "intro": "Lepidagathis brevis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. The plant features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Lepidagathis brevis is generally drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions."
