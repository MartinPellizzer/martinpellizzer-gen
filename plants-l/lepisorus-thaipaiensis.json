    "intro": "Lepisorus thaipaiensis, commonly known as the Thai mountain maidenhair, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Lepisorus thaipaiensis is valued for its ornamental foliage and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
