It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces a single, showy pink or red flower atop a slender stem. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Lychnis uniflora is an annual or biennial plant with a short life cycle and is often found in disturbed or marginal environments."
