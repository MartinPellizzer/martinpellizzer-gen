    "intro": "Lepanthes obtusipetala, commonly known as the blunt-petaled orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Lepanthes obtusipetala is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
