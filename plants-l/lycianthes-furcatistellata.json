    "intro": "Lycianthes furcatistellata, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a berry that turns red when mature, and it contains toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is sometimes studied for its chemical composition."
