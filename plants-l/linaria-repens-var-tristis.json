    "intro": "Linaria repens var. tristis, commonly known as the weeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features delicate, slender stems that trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with four petals, resembling those of the common toadflax. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various arid environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
