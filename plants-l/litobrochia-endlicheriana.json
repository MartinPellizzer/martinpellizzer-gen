    "intro": "Litobrochia endlicheriana, commonly known as the stonecrop or rockrose, is a perennial succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often blooming in spring. It is well adapted to poor soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Litobrochia endlicheriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
