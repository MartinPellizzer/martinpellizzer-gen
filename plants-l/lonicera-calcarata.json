It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, red berry that matures in the fall and is a food source for birds and small mammals. Lonicera calcarata is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
