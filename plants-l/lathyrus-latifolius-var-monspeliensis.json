It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental plants.
