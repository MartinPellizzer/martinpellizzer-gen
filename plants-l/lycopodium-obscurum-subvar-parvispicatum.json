    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum subvar. parvispicatum, commonly known as the small-spored clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant produces spore-bearing strobila, or cones, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Its leaves are spirally arranged and have a distinctive, scale-like appearance. This subspecies is characterized by its compact size and reduced spore production compared to other members of the species."
