    "intro": "Larix fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pyramid-shaped crown, needle-like leaves, and distinctive cone structure. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that remain attached to the branches for several years. Its needles are typically blue-green in color and have a fine, powdery coating. The Fraser fir is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in mixed forests with other coniferous species."
