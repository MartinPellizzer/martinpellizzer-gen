    "intro": "Limonium pomelianum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spike-like flower heads composed of numerous small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Limonium pomelianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
