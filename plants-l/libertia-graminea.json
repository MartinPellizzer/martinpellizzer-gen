    "intro": "Libertia graminea, commonly known as the grassleaf libertia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant, often purple or blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Libertia graminea is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
