    "intro": "Lepiscline, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Lepiscline species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to bloom in harsh conditions."
