    "intro": "Lachnaea buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive dark green to blackish upper surface with a whitish to yellowish lower surface. The thallus is leathery and often forms dense mats on tree trunks and branches. It is characterized by its leaf-like lobes that are closely spaced and resemble the foliage of boxwood plants. This lichen is typically found in temperate regions and is an indicator of clean air due to its sensitivity to pollution."
