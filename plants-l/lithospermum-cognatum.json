It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are reddish in color and contain compounds such as lithospermic acid, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Lithospermum cognatum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
