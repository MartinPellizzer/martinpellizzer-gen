    "intro": "Lathyrus maritimus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth sea lupin, is a perennial leguminous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, smooth texture, hence its varietal name \"glaber.\" It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often growing in saline or slightly alkaline conditions. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for coastal ecosystems and soil enrichment."
