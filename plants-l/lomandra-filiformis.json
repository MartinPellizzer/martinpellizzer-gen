    "intro": "Lomandra filiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Lomandra filiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-maintenance garden settings."
