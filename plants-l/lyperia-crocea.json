    "intro": "Lyperia crocea, commonly known as the pink sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Lyperia crocea is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
