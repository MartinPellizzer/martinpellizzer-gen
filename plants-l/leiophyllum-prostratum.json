    "intro": "Leiophyllum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate leiothyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and landscaping."
