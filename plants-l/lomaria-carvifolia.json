It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a silvery-white coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
