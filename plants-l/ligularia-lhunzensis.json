    "intro": "Ligularia lhunzensis, commonly known as the Himalayan ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
