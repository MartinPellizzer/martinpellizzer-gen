    "intro": "Leuciva, commonly known as the white ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, which help it adhere to surfaces as it climbs. Leuciva is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
