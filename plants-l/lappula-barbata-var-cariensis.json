    "intro": "Lappula barbata var. cariensis, commonly known as the hairy lappula, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a slender, elongated silique. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Lappula barbata."
