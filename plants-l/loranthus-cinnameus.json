    "intro": "Loranthus cinnameus, commonly known as the cinnamon or Indian satinwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as mango and tamarind. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its berries, which are fleshy and edible. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
