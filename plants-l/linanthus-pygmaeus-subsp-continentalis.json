It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
