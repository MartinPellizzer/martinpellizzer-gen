    "intro": "Linaria multicaulis f. aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
