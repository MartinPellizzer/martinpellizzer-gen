    "intro": "Leptochilus elegans, commonly known as the elegant leech fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, which helps in water retention. The leaves are usually evergreen, with a distinct, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
