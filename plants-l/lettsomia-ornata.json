    "intro": "Lettsomia ornata, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Lettsomia ornata is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
