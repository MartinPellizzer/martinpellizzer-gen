    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum squamosum, commonly known as the scalycush plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
