    "intro": "Lindsaea retusa, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups known as sori. Lindsaea retusa is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
