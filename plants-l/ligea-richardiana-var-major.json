    "intro": "Ligea richardiana var. major, commonly known as the giant ligea, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
