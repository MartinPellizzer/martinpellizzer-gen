    "intro": "Lucuma inseparabilis, commonly known as the golden fruit tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, yellow-orange fruits that resemble small pineapples, with a sweet, custard-like flesh. The plant thrives in tropical highland climates, requiring well-drained soil and a cool, humid environment. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and it plays a significant role in both local cuisine and cultural practices."
