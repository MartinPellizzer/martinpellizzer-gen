    "intro": "Lobelia fenestralis var. pectinata, commonly known as the fenestrate lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive translucent windows or 'fenestrations' that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique leaf structure and delicate flowers make it a striking addition to native gardens and wetland restoration projects."
