    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. lucidulum, commonly known as the shining clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss genus Lycopodium. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. This variety is notable for its glossy foliage and its role in forest ecosystems as a pioneer species in disturbed areas."
