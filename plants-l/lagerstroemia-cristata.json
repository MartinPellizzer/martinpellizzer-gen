    "intro": "Lagerstroemia cristata, commonly known as the crested crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that appear in late spring or early summer, often in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, turning reddish in the fall before dropping. Lagerstroemia cristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
