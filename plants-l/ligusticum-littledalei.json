    "intro": "Ligusticum littledalei, commonly known as the Littledale's lovage, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant features finely dissected, fern-like leaves and produces small white to greenish-yellow flowers in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
