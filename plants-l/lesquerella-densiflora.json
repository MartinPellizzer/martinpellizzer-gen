    "intro": "Lesquerella densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. Lesquerella densiflora produces seeds that contain high levels of erucic acid, making it a valuable source for industrial and cosmetic applications. Due to its unique chemical composition, it is also of interest in ecological and conservation studies."
