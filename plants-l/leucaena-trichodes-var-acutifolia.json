    "intro": "Leucaena trichodes var. acutifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features bipinnate leaves with small, sharp leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in compact clusters. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in agroforestry systems."
