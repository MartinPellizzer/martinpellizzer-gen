    "intro": "Ligustrum robustum subsp. perrottetii, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, fleshy berries. It is often used in landscaping due to its dense growth habit and tolerance to various soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plant species."
