    "intro": "Lepisorus simulans, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus simulans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in various soil types when provided with adequate moisture."
