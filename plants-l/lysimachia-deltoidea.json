    "intro": "Lysimachia deltoidea, commonly known as delta leaf chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist woodlands and stream banks in North America. It features small, deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Lysimachia deltoidea is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
