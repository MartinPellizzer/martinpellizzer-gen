    "intro": "Lightfootia capitata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or small-leaved velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Lightfootia capitata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
