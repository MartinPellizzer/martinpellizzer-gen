    "intro": "Lycopodium hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Lycopodium hoffmannii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
