    "intro": "Lindernia tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with opposite, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
