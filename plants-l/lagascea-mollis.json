    "intro": "Lagascea mollis, commonly known as the softleaf lagascea, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has a sprawling growth habit with soft, hairy stems. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a woolly texture that helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
