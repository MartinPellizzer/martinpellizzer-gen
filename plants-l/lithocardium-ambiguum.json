    "intro": "Lithocardium ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. Lithocardium ambiguum is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive in dry conditions. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils."
