    "intro": "Lobelia robusta var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
