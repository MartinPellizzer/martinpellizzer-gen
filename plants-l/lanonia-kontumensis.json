It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lanonia kontumensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
