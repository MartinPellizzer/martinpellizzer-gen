    "intro": "Ligustrum album, commonly known as white privet, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top and lighter beneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping for its dense growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
