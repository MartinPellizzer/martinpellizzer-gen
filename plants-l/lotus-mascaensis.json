    "intro": "Lotus mascaensis, commonly known as the Mascate lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of the Middle East. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and wetlands, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, blooming during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
