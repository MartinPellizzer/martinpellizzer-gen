    "intro": "Lotus callunetorum, commonly known as the lesser lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. The lesser lotus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
