    "intro": "Leontopodium monoicum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with poor soil and strong winds. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a thick layer of fine, silky hairs. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions and is a symbol of resilience and purity."
