    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. haleakalae, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 clubmoss, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that give it a clubmoss appearance. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
