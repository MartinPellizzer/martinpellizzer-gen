    "intro": "Lepanthes echinata, commonly known as the spiny orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature bright colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Lepanthes echinata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
