    "intro": "Lastrea radicans, commonly known as the creeping lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its trailing growth habit makes it an attractive choice for rock gardens or hanging baskets."
