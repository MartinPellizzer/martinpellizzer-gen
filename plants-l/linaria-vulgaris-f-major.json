It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Linaria vulgaris f. major is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
