    "intro": "Lardizabala trifoliolata, commonly known as the Andean arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant typically grows in cool, humid climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence. Lardizabala trifoliolata is valued for its starchy tubers, which are used in traditional Andean cuisine."
