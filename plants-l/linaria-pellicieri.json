    "intro": "Linaria pellicieri, commonly known as the velvetleaf toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Linaria pellicieri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
