    "intro": "Loranthus vitellinus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum. It lacks true roots and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while conducting photosynthesis with its broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in dispersal. This variety is characterized by its smooth, hairless appearance, distinguishing it from other mistletoe species."
