    "intro": "Lecanthus corniculatus var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan lecanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, while its stems are slender and often branched. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
