    "intro": "Lathyrus magniflorus, commonly known as the giant sweet pea, is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Lathyrus magniflorus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators and other beneficial insects."
