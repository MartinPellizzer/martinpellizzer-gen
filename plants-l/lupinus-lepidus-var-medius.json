It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
