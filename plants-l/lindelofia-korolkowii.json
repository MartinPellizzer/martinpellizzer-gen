    "intro": "Lindelofia korolkowii, commonly known as the Korolkowii's lindelofia, is a rare and unique member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its striking, large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
