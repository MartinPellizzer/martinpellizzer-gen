    "intro": "Lolium humile, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is adapted to temperate climates and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness. Lolium humile is also a common weed in agricultural settings, thriving in nutrient-rich soils."
