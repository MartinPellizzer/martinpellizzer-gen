    "intro": "Linkia gunnii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system allows it to store water and nutrients, contributing to its resilience in its natural habitat. The fronds are often used in traditional M\u0101ori crafts and have cultural significance in New Zealand."
