    "intro": "Liparis flavescens, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
