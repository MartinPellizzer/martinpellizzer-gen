    "intro": "Ledum groenlandicum f. denudatum, commonly known as the naked Labrador tea, is a variant of the Labrador tea plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with smaller, more sparse leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
