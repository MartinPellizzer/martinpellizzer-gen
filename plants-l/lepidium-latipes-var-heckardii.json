    "intro": "Lepidium latipes var. heckardii, commonly known as the coastal cress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. This variety is often found in maritime environments and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
