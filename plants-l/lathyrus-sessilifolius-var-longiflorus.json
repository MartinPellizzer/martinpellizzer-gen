    "intro": "Lathyrus sessilifolius var. longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands."
