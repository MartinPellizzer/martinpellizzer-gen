    "intro": "Luehea rufescens, commonly known as the red-hair tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing three to four seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
