    "intro": "Lozanella trematoides, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America. It typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lozanella trematoides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
