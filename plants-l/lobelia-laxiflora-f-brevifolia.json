    "intro": "Lobelia laxiflora f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The foliage is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of L. laxiflora. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
