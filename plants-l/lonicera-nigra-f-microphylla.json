    "intro": "Lonicera nigra f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf black honeysuckle, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Lonicera nigra, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. Its berries are dark red to black, adding ornamental value in the fall. This variety is valued for its compact growth habit and adaptability to a variety of soil types."
