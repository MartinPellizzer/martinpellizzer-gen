    "intro": "Lactuca viminea subsp. alpestris, commonly known as alpine lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates and seasonal temperature fluctuations."
