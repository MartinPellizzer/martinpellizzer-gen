    "intro": "Lygodictyon reticulatum, commonly known as the nettle fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are often covered in fine hairs, which can cause mild irritation upon contact. Lygodictyon reticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
