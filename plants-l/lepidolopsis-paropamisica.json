It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces showy, often colorful flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered with a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.
