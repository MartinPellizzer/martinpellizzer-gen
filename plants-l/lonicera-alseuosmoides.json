    "intro": "Lonicera alseuosmoides, commonly known as Chinese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The flowers are typically borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant bears red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
