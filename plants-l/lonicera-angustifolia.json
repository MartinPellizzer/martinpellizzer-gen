    "intro": "Lonicera angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Lonicera angustifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
