    "intro": "Lycopodium javanicum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for reproduction. Lycopodium javanicum is characterized by its primitive structure, resembling ancient plants from the Carboniferous period."
