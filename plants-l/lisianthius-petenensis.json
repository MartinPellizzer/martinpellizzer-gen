    "intro": "Lisianthius petenensis, commonly known as the Pet\u00e9n lisianthus, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly found in the Pet\u00e9n region of Guatemala. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
