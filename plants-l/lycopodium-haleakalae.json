    "intro": "Lycopodium haleakalae, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 clubmoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called sporophytes. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
