    "intro": "Lobelia rupestris, commonly known as the rock lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet. Lobelia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
