    "intro": "Linum corymbiferum subsp. corymbiferum, commonly known as the clustered flax or yellow flax, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open meadows and rocky areas. Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to other members of the Linaceae family, but it is distinguished by its dense inflorescences."
