    "intro": "Licuala cordata, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often with a swollen, fibrous stem at the base. Its leaves are stiff and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant is often used in traditional crafts and as a ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
