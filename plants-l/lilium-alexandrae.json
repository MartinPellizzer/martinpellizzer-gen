    "intro": "Lilium alexandrae, commonly known as Alexandra's lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its bulbs are perennial, and it reproduces through seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
