    "intro": "Lamium sempervirens, commonly known as dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It has a sprawling growth habit and can spread through stolons, making it a common ground cover in gardens. Lamium sempervirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in shaded areas."
