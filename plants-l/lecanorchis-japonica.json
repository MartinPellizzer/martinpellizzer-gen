    "intro": "Lecanorchis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of white to pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors of eastern Asia. Lecanorchis japonica is notable for its lack of a visible stem and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
