    "intro": "Lumnitzera coccinea, commonly known as red mangrove, is a halophytic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along coastlines. The plant has prop roots that extend into the water, aiding in stabilization and nutrient absorption. Its small, pinkish flowers are followed by orange to red fruits that contain buoyant seeds. Lumnitzera coccinea plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
