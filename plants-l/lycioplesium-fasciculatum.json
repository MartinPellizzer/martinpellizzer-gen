    "intro": "Lycioplesium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically hairy in texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid ingestion or contact with its parts."
