    "intro": "Lanugothamnus anabelae, commonly known as the Anabel's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
