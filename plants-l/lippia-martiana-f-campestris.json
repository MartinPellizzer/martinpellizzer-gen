    "intro": "Lippia martiana f. campestris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lippia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The varietal form 'campestris' distinguishes it from other forms of Lippia martiana by its distinct leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
