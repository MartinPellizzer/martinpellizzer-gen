    "intro": "Lessertia subcanescens, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal star, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens."
