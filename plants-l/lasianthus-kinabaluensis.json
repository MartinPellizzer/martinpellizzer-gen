    "intro": "Lasianthus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu lasianthus, is a flowering plant native to the montane forests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant grows as an erect shrub, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
