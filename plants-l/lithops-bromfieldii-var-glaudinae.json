    "intro": "Lithops bromfieldii var. glaudinae, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lithops bromfieldii var. glaudinae requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
