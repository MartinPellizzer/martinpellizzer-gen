    "intro": "Loudetia trigemina, commonly known as the three-angled grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a triangular cross-section. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along waterways. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive species within the grass family, Poaceae."
