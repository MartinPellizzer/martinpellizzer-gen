    "intro": "Ludekia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ludekia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and prominent stamens, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
