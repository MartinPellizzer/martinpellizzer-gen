    "intro": "Locandi, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual display. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a contrast to its colorful blossoms. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The botanical name *Anthurium* is often associated with similar plants, though *Locandi* is a less commonly recognized species within the same family."
