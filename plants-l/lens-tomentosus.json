    "intro": "Lens tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly lens, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, lens-shaped leaves covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shrublands and rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
