    "intro": "Laportea septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of small, purple to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Laportea septentrionalis is often found in prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
