    "intro": "Laurus myrrha, commonly known as myrrh tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-green foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is harvested to make myrrh, a valuable aromatic substance used in incense and traditional medicine. Myrrh trees thrive in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or limestone soils. The plant has a long history of use in religious rituals, perfumery, and as a natural remedy for various ailments."
