    "intro": "Loranthus limprichtii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and has a complex life cycle involving both parasitic and photosynthetic phases. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which contain one or two seeds, are dispersed by birds and other animals. Loranthus limprichtii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for wildlife."
