    "intro": "Lathyrus latifolius var. neglectus, commonly known as the broad-leaved grass vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has ornamental value in gardens."
