    "intro": "Limoniastrum, commonly known as the desert star or yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and aromatic leaves. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with hairy stems and are adapted to arid environments. Limoniastrum species often have a strong, spicy scent and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. They are also valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
