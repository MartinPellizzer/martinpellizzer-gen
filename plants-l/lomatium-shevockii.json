    "intro": "Lomatium shevockii, commonly known as Shevock's lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flowers. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly in Oregon and Washington, where it thrives in moist, forested environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like foliage and produces small, white to yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as along stream banks and in coniferous forests. Lomatium shevockii is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
