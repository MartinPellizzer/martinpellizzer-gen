It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. Due to its toxic compounds, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to both humans and animals."
