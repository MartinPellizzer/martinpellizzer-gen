    "intro": "Lobelia quarreana, commonly known as the Florida lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled leaves with a distinctive bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
