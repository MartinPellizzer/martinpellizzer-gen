    "intro": "Leptinella dispersa subsp. dispersa, commonly known as the scattered lepidote, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage, with small, rounded leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are borne on slender, hairy stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
