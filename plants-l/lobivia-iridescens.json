    "intro": "Lobivia iridescens, commonly known as the rainbow lobivia, is a succulent native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features striking, ribbed stems that display a range of colors, including green, blue, and purple, depending on light exposure. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding to its ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
