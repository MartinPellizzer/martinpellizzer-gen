    "intro": "Lamium scardicum, commonly known as greater deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Lamium scardicum is often used in herbal medicine for its purported sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
