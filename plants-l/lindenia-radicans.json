    "intro": "Lindenia radicans, commonly known as the trailing linden, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Lindenia radicans is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
