    "intro": "Lycopodium struthioloides var. margaritae, commonly known as the coral clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered stems and bright red, spore-bearing cones that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in moist, acidic soils within shaded, forested environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as strobila, which houses the spores essential for its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
