    "intro": "Loranthus florulentus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through bird-mediated means. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
