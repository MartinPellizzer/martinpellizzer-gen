It features slender, erect stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are typically dark purple to almost black, with a distinctive bilabiate structure, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its striking color and ability to attract pollinators."
