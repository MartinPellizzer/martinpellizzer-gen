It is a low-growing annual or biennial species characterized by its small, pinnately divided leaves and clusters of tiny white or yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that split open to release the seeds. It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and thrives in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
