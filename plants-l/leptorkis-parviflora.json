    "intro": "Leptorkis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered leptorkis, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
