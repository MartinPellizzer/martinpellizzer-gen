It features dense, mat-forming growth with slender, often hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Loasa caespitosa is well adapted to rocky or dry soils and is often found in woodland or chaparral habitats."
