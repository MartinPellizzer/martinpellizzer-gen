    "intro": "Lespedeza argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that have a silvery-white underside, giving it its common name. Its small, pink to reddish-purple flowers appear in late summer, forming dense clusters at the tips of the branches. Lespedeza argyrophylla is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
