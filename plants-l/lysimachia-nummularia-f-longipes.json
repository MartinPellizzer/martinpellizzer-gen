    "intro": "Lysimachia nummularia f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed pennywort, is a variant of the common pennywort, characterized by its elongated stems and compact, rounded leaves. It is a low-growing evergreen perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its foliage remains dense and attractive throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is well-suited for wetland restoration and water garden settings."
