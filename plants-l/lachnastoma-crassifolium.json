    "intro": "Lachnastoma crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant's thallus is composed of a complex interwoven network of fungal hyphae and algal cells. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health."
