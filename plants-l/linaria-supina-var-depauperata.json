    "intro": "Linaria supina var. depauperata, commonly known as the poorflower or creeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
