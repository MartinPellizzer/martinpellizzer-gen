    "intro": "Ledum macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved labrador tea, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often aromatic and tinged with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots and leaves contain toxic compounds, including labdane diterpenes, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and forested areas."
