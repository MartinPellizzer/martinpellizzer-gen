    "intro": "Lilium centifolium, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting a cluster of showy, red or pink cup-shaped flowers. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lilium centifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
