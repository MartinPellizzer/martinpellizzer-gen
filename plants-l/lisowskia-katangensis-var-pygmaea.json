    "intro": "Lisowskia katangensis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lisowskia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing no taller than 10 centimeters, with compact, rosette-like foliage. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color, which are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
