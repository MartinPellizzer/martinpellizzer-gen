    "intro": "Leontodon crispus subsp. asperrimus, commonly known as the rough leontodon, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has a creeping growth habit and produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. The subspecies asperrimus is distinguished by its more pronounced roughness and shorter, more rigid leaves compared to other subspecies."
