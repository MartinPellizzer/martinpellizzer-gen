    "intro": "Lobelia aquatica var. gracilis, commonly known as slender water lobelia, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, upright stems that often grow in water or moist soil, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. This variety is more compact than the typical lobelia, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces with adequate moisture."
