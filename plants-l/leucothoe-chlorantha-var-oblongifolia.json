    "intro": "Leucothoe chlorantha var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its dense growth habit also makes it useful for erosion control and as a privacy screen."
