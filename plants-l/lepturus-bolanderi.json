    "intro": "Lepturus bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's leek, is a rare plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that bears white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
