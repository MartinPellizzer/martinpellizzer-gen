It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators.

Its botanical features make it a unique and interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
