    "intro": "Lindsaea repens var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan creeping lindsaea, is a terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific, particularly the Marquesas Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, producing a dense carpet of foliage. The plant features slender, arching fronds with a dichotomous branching pattern, and its leaves are typically elongated with a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or disturbed soils. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphology and geographic distribution within the Lindsaea genus."
