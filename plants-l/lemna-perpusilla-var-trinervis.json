    "intro": "Lemna perpusilla var. trinervis, commonly known as the small-leaf watermeal, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae). It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The leaves are oval or elliptical in shape and often have a distinct central vein, which is more prominent in this variety. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for various aquatic animals."
