It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. Botanically, it is notable for its complex pollination mechanisms involving specific insect species."
