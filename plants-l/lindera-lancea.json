    "intro": "Lindera lancea, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, woodlands and streambanks, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late spring, followed by elliptical, red berries that are a food source for birds. The bark is reddish-brown and becomes scaly with age, contributing to its ornamental value."
