    "intro": "Lilium atrosanguineum, commonly known as the black-red lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of deep red to almost black. The plant produces large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its bulbs are thick and fleshy, typical of the Liliaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, slightly alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Lilium atrosanguineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
