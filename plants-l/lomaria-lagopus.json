    "intro": "Lomaria lagopus, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a silvery appearance. Lomaria lagopus thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
