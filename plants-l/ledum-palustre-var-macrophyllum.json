    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. macrophyllum, commonly known as large-leaved Labrador tea, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves that are larger than those of the typical Ledum palustre. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, including aromatic acids, which contribute to its distinctive scent and have been used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and wetlands."
