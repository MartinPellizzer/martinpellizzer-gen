    "intro": "Lolium rosetlanum, commonly known as red grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit and bright red to purple flower heads, which distinguish it from other grasses. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Lolium rosetlanum is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
