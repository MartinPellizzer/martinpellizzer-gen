    "intro": "Lophiolepis maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is a low-growing, perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Lophiolepis maroccana is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall."
