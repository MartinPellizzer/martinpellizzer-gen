    "intro": "Leptocarpus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often blue or purple, bract-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are often brightly colored. These plants are native to coastal regions of southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Leptocarpus species are well adapted to saline and windy environments, making them resilient and hardy in challenging coastal conditions."
