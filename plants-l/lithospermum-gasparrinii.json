    "intro": "Lithospermum gasparrinii, commonly known as the Gasparrini's rock pepper, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly woolly texture, while its roots produce a red, staining pigment called lithospermic acid. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
