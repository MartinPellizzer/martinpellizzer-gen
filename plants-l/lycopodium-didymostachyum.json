    "intro": "Lycopodium didymostachyum, commonly known as the two-stamen clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia that release spores. Lycopodium didymostachyum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among primitive vascular plants."
