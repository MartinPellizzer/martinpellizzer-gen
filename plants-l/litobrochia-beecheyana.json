    "intro": "Litobrochia beecheyana, commonly known as the coastal brochobrochia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the rocky shores of southern South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, waxy leaves adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Its survival depends on specific microclimatic conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
