    "intro": "Lobivia mirabunda, commonly known as the rainbow lobivia, is a compact, flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to its harsh environment. Lobivia mirabunda is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
