    "intro": "Leptinella perpusilla, commonly known as the fairy bells, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its alpine or subalpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
