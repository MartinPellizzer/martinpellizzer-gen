It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and vibrant floral display."
