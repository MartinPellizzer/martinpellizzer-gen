    "intro": "Lantana peduncularis, commonly known as the coral bean, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom from summer to fall. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, bean-like seeds. Lantana peduncularis is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as swamps and streambanks."
