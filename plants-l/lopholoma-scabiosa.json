    "intro": "Lopholoma scabiosa, commonly known as the rough lichen, is a member of the Lichenes family. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rock surfaces, soil, or wood, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its thallus is usually leathery and can range in color from gray to brown. Lopholoma scabiosa plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
