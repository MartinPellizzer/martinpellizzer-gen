    "intro": "Lachnorhiza piloselloides subsp. piloselloides, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a pale green to yellowish thallus with a leathery texture and is often found on bark, stones, or soil. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its thallus for nutrient uptake and photosynthesis. This subspecies is characterized by its delicate, sprawling growth form and is typically found in temperate regions."
