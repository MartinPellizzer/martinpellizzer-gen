It features slender, erect stems that bear small, tubular flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lobelia pallida is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
