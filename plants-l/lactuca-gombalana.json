    "intro": "Lactuca gombalana, commonly known as the Italian endive, is a leafy vegetable belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its curly, dark green leaves that are often used in salads and cooked dishes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 50 to 100 centimeters and has a rosette-like structure. Its leaves are crisp and have a slightly bitter taste, which is more pronounced in the outer leaves.
