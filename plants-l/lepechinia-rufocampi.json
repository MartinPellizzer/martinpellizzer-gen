    "intro": "Lepechinia rufocampi, commonly known as the red camp lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is an annual or biennial herb that thrives in cold climates and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
