    "intro": "Limnorchis, commonly known as the water orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Limnorchidaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Limnorchis species are characterized by their delicate, often showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plants often form dense clusters. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species of Limnorchis are considered rare or endangered."
