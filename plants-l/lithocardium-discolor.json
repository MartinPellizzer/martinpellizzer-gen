    "intro": "Lithocardium discolor, commonly known as the variable lithops, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are typically yellow or orange and are borne on short stems. Lithocardium discolor is a popular succulent among collectors due to its striking appearance and adaptability to cultivation."
