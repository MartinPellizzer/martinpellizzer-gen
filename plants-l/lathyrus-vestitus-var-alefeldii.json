    "intro": "Lathyrus vestitus var. alefeldii, commonly known as the Alefeld's hairy vetch, is a climbing legume native to southern Europe. It features slender, twining stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and its leaves are trifoliate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several oblong seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal remedies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability in garden soils."
