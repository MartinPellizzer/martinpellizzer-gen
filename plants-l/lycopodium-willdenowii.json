It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its ability to form dense mats of foliage. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium willdenowii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution."
