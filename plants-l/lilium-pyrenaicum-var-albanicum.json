    "intro": "Lilium pyrenaicum var. albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian pyrenean lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple throat, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a tall, slender stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
