    "intro": "Lycopodiella veigae, commonly known as the Veiga's clubmoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. This species is primarily found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodiella veigae reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes a distinct gametophyte stage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
