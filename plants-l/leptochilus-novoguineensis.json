It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, leek-like foliage. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
