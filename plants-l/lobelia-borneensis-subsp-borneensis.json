    "intro": "Lobelia borneensis subsp. borneensis, commonly known as Bornean lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant is herbaceous, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
