    "intro": "Leontopodium helveticum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and beauty in mountainous environments. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is protected in many regions."
