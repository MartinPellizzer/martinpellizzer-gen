    "intro": "Lactuca muralis, commonly known as wall lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in rocky or wall environments. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
