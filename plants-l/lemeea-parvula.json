    "intro": "Lemeea parvula, commonly known as the small lemming plant, is a rare and delicate species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and hairy stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Lemeea parvula is considered a species of conservation concern."
