    "intro": "Lecythis rubicunda, commonly known as the red lecythium, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, orange-red flowers that attract various pollinators. The tree's fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The bark and seeds of Lecythis rubicunda have been used by indigenous communities for medicinal purposes. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
