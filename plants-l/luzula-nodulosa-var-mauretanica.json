It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. The varietal form, mauretanica, is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits adapted to its native environment."
