    "intro": "Lucuma serpentaria var. dominigensis, commonly known as the Dominican lucuma, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Lauraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to other lucuma species but are less commonly cultivated. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and the plant has a woody stem with a distinct aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
