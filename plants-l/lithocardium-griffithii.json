    "intro": "Lithocardium griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Lithocardium griffithii is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens."
