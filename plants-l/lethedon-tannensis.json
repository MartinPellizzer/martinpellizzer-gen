    "intro": "Lethedon tannensis, commonly known as the Tanninwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, dark-green foliage and smooth, bark-like trunk that exudes a strong tannin scent. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Lethedon tannensis is valued for its durable wood, which is resistant to decay and used in traditional construction. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various rainforest species."
