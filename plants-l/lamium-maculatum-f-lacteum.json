    "intro": "Lamium maculatum f. lacteum, commonly known as the white spotted deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white or pale green spots, and its flowers are typically pink or violet, arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, variegated appearance."
