    "intro": "Lycaste skinneri var. delicatissima, commonly known as the delicate lycaste, is a hybrid orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, pseudobulbous stems and long, arching leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a potted plant."
