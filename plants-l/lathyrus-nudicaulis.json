It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
