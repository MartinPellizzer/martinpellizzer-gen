    "intro": "Lithocarpus wangianus, commonly known as the Wangian stone oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts, which are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth and mixed dipterocarp forests. The leaves are thick, leathery, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
