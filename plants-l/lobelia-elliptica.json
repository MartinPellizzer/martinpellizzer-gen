    "intro": "Lobelia elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The leaves are elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
