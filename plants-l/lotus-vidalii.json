    "intro": "Lotus vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots help stabilize water sediments, contributing to aquatic ecosystem health. Lotus vidalii is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
