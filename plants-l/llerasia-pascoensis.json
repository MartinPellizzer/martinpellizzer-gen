    "intro": "Llerasia pascoensis, commonly known as the Pasco's llerasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Llerasia pascoensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
