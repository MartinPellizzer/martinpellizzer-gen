    "intro": "Lupinus spathulatus, commonly known as the broadleaf lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Lupinus spathulatus plays an important role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting soil health."
