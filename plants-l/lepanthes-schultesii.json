    "intro": "Lepanthes schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as pink, white, or purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. Lepanthes schultesii is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests."
