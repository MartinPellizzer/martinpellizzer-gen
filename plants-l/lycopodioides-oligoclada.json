It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Lycopodioides oligoclada plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
