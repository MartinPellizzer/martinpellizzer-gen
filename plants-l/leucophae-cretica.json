It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry, sun-exposed environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Leucophae cretica is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
