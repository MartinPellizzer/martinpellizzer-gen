It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the Cape Province. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
