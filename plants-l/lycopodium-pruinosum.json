    "intro": "Lycopodium pruinosum, commonly known as the velvet clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. L. pruinosum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
