    "intro": "Lamium microphyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or violet, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive texture and appearance."
