    "intro": "Lobelia glandulosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular stems and smooth, glabrous leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of lobelia. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects and native gardens."
