It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Luzula alpestris thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its foliage is generally dark green and grass-like, with a dense arrangement that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions."
