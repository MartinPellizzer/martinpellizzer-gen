    "intro": "Lucilia aretioides, commonly known as the common green bottle fly. It is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae, characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive appearance. The plant is not a botanical species but rather an insect, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. The larvae of this fly are often found on decaying organic matter, contributing to decomposition processes. It plays a role in forensic entomology due to its predictable life cycle and habitat preferences."
