    "intro": "Litsea costalis var. nidularis, commonly known as the fragrant leafed evergreen, is a variant of the Litsea costalis species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, ovate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. The varietal form, nidularis, is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and increased fragrance compared to the typical variety."
