    "intro": "Leptospermum blakelyi, commonly known as the Blakely\u2019s tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Leptospermum blakelyi is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments."
