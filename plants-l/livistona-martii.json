    "intro": "Livistona martii, commonly known as the mountain palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its inflorescences are usually clustered at the base of the leaves, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Livistona martii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
