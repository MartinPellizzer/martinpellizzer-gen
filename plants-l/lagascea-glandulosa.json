    "intro": "Lagascea glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf mallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in sticky secretions, which help deter herbivores. Lagascea glandulosa is typically found in rocky soils and arid environments, adapting well to dry conditions."
