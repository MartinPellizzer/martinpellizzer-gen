    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. ruberrima, commonly known as the red-flowered twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which contrast sharply with the typical white or pink blooms of the species. The plant is a low-growing perennial with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and its role in early spring ecosystems."
