    "intro": "Lepidium bonariense var. hirsutulum, commonly known as the hairy rocket, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. It is often cultivated as a leafy vegetable due to its peppery flavor and nutritional value. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
