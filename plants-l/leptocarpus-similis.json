    "intro": "Leptocarpus similis, commonly known as the slender root fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry rhizomes and delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. Leptocarpus similis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
