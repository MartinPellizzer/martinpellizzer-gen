    "intro": "Lamium, commonly known as dead-nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate leaves and showy, often pink or white flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Lamium species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some are annuals, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
