    "intro": "Lacaitaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the canopy of old-growth forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lacaitaea is considered an endangered species."
