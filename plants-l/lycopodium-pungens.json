    "intro": "Lycopodium pungens, commonly known as the spiny clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, spiny protrusions. Lycopodium pungens is typically found in rocky or forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
