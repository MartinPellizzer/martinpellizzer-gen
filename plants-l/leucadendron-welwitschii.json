    "intro": "Leucadendron welwitschii, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, especially when backlit. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in cone-like structures, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
