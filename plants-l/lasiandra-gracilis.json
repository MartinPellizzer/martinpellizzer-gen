It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its woody stems are aromatic and have been historically used in traditional medicine. Lasiandra gracilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
