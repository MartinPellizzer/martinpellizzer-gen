    "intro": "Larix alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaskan larch, is a deciduous conifer native to western Alaska. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow before falling off in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing. It thrives in cold, boreal environments and is adapted to permafrost conditions. Its wood is lightweight and durable, making it valuable for construction and crafts."
