    "intro": "Leptoglottis, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist to waterlogged soils. Leptoglottis species are characterized by their striking, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The leaves are usually broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. They play an important ecological role in their habitats by providing food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
