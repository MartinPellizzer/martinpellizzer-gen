    "intro": "Lycianthes nyssifolia, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that change from green to black as they mature. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for consumption but is valued in traditional medicine."
