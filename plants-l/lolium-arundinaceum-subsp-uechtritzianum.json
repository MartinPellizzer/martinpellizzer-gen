    "intro": "Lolium arundinaceum subsp. uechtritzianum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
