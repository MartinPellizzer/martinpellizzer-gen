    "intro": "Limnorchis ensifolia, commonly known as the sword-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Limnorchis ensifolia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
