    "intro": "Lupinus garrettianus, commonly known as the Garrett's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Lupinus garrettianus plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
