    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. pseudoalpinum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the high altitudes of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect branches called strobila. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain meadows and rocky soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
