    "intro": "Lamourouxia dependens, commonly known as the hanging bell orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that hang from the stems, often in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or mountainous regions. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
