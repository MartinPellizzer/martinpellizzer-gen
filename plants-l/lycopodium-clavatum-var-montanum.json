    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form tight, club-shaped clusters, giving it its common name. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. This variety is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cooler, humid climates."
