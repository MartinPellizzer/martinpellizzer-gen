It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely arranged around the stem. Its flowering spikes bear small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the nominate form."
