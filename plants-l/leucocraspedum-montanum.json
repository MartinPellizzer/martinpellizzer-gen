    "intro": "Leucocraspedum montanum, commonly known as the mountain leucocraspedum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species in many areas."
