    "intro": "Lemna leiboensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of its leaves. Lemna leiboensis is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
