    "intro": "Leandra thyrsiflora, commonly known as the thrysis orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to retain moisture. The flowers, which can be pink, purple, or white, are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
