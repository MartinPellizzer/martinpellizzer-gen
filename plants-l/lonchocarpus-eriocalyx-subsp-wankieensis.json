    "intro": "Lonchocarpus eriocalyx subsp. wankieensis, commonly known as the African senna, is a leguminous shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
