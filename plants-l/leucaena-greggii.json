    "intro": "Leucaena greggii, commonly known as Gregg's leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately compound, and its small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Leucaena greggii is adapted to drought conditions and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system."
