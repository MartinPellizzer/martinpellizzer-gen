    "intro": "Linum usitatissimum var. imperforatum, commonly known as the imperforate flax, is a variant of the flax plant characterized by its distinct leaf morphology. The leaves are typically narrow, elongated, and lack the characteristic serrations found in other flax varieties, giving them a smooth, almost silky texture. This variety is primarily cultivated for its fiber, which is used in textile production, though it may also be grown for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. The plant produces blue or white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is similar to other flax species, with a preference for well-drained soils and temperate climates."
