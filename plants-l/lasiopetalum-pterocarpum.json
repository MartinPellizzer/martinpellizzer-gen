It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is often found in coastal and tableland regions, where it forms dense thickets. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
