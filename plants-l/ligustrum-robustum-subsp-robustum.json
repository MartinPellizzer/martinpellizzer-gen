    "intro": "Ligustrum robustum subsp. robustum, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
