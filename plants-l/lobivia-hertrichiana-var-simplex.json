    "intro": "Lobivia hertrichiana var. simplex, commonly known as the Simple Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with distinctive, wavy, and often lobed ribs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry environments, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
