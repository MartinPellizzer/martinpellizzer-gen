    "intro": "Leucopogon pimeleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and evergreen plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Leucopogon pimeleoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
