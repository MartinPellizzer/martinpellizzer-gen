    "intro": "Lilium leichtlinii majus, commonly known as the giant white lily, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, white, trumpet-shaped flowers. It typically blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The leaves are long and narrow, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and the plant prefers well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
