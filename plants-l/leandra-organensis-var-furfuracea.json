    "intro": "Leandra organensis var. furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy leandra, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage, which gives it its scientific name \"furfuracea,\" derived from the Latin word for \"scaly\" or \"hairy.\" The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are large,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. The flowers are small and clustered, usually in panicles, and can range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
