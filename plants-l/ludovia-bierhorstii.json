    "intro": "Ludovia bierhorstii, commonly known as the Bierhorst's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant is herbaceous, with slender stems and trifoliate leaves that have a distinctive, finely toothed edge. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
