    "intro": "Litobrochia tussacii, commonly known as the Tussacii grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in cold, arid conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Litobrochia tussacii plays a role in stabilizing soil in these fragile ecosystems."
