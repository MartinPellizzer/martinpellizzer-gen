    "intro": "Lamium album subsp. transcaucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian white dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical Lamium album."
