    "intro": "Leptorkis longipes, commonly known as the long-footed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with distinctive sepals and petals that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as mountainous forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
