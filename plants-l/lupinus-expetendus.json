    "intro": "Lupinus expetendus, commonly known as the velvet lupin, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several oblong seeds, which are often used as a protein source in some regions. Lupinus expetendus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for drought-tolerant landscaping. Its ornamental value and nutritional potential have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and agricultural research."
