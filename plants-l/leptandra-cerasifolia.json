    "intro": "Leptandra cerasifolia, commonly known as the cherry-leafed leptandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that ripens in the summer, attracting various birds and small mammals. Leptandra cerasifolia is typically found in moist, acidic soils in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
