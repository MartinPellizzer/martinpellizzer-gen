    "intro": "Livistona victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's palm, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in a spadix, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
