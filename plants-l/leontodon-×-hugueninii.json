    "intro": "Leontodon \u00d7 hugueninii, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Leontodon alpinus and Leontodon taraxacoides. It is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers, which typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
