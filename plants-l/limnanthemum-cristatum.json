    "intro": "Limnanthemum cristatum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Limnanthemum cristatum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil and supporting other plant growth."
