    "intro": "Laportea bulbifera var. sinensis, commonly known as Chinese bulbous dock, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its bulbous root system is notable for its thick, fleshy structure, which stores nutrients and aids in survival during dry periods."
