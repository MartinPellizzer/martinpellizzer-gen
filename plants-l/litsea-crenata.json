    "intro": "Litsea crenata, commonly known as Japanese boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its slow growth rate and ability to be shaped into topiaries make it a versatile plant in landscaping."
