    "intro": "Lobivia marsoneri var. iridescens, commonly known as the Rainbow Lobivia, is a succulent native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features compact, rounded growth with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and the varietal name \"iridescens\" refers to the shimmering, reflective surface of its stems. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
