    "intro": "Lactuca farinulenta, commonly known as the farinose lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. The leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making it a lesser-known but flavorful green."
