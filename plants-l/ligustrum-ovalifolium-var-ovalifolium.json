    "intro": "Ligustrum ovalifolium var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the common privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and dense growth habit. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
