It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-gray, hairy leaves and its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky habitats and open slopes, particularly in the Sierra Nevada range. Lewisia serrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
