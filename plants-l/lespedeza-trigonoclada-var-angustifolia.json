    "intro": "Lespedeza trigonoclada var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with slender, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters. It is often found in the understory of forests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators. The species is also used in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
