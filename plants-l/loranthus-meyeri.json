    "intro": "Loranthus meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions. Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the health of its host tree."
