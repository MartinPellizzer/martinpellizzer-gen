    "intro": "Leontopodium muscoides, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It features dense, woolly white or pale yellow flowers surrounded by a ring of fuzzy, bract-like leaves. The plant's stems are often covered in a thick layer of soft, white hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, sunny climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often considered a symbol of resilience and alpine beauty."
