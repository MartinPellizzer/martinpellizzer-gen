    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subsp. crassifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved bird's-foot trefoil, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are broader and more robust compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
