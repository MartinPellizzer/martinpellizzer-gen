    "intro": "Laurus cuspidata, commonly known as the prickly laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in coastal environments and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
