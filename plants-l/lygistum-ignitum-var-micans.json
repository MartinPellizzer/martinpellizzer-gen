    "intro": "Lygistum ignitum var. micans, commonly known as the glowing nightshade, is a striking plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black foliage and vibrant, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow in the dark. The plant's leaves are glossy and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its flowers, which bloom at night, attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and scientific interest."
