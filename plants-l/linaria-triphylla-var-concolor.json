    "intro": "Linaria triphylla var. concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other varieties of Linaria. It is often found in open habitats, including grasslands and dry slopes."
