    "intro": "Lachnopylis schistotricha, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a member of the Lichenes family and exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It typically grows on moist, shaded surfaces such as tree bark, rocks, or soil, thriving in temperate climates. The plant's structure consists of a dense, leathery thallus covered in fine, hair-like structures called rhizines, which help anchor it to its substrate. Its color ranges from pale green to yellowish-green, and it often appears as a crusty or leafy growth. Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
