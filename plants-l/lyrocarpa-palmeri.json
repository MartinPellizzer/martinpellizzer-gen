    "intro": "Lyrocarpa palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's lyreleaf, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves, which are compound and arranged in a unique, fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Lyrocarpa palmeri is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access groundwater."
