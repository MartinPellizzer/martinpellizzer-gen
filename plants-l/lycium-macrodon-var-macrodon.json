It is characterized by its small, red, fleshy fruits that resemble berries, which are edible when fully ripe. The plant produces clusters of yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The red medlar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
