    "intro": "Laserpitium crithminum, commonly known as the common centaury, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 60 cm tall, with a taproot system that helps it survive in various environmental conditions. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
