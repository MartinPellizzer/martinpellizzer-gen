    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum subvar. recurvatum, commonly known as the flat lycopod, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat."
