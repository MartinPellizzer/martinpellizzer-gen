It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
