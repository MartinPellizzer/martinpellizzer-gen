It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and often showy inflorescences. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical specimen."
