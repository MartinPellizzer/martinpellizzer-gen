    "intro": "Lathyrus albus subvar. peduncularis, commonly known as the white pea or white vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, hairy leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several angular seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
