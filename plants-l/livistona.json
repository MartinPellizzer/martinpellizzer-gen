Livistona species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. They typically grow as solitary trees with a smooth, unbranched trunk. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
