    "intro": "Leuconymphaea caerulea, commonly known as the blue-eyed river lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, often displaying a vibrant blue or white coloration. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, which bloom above the water. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
