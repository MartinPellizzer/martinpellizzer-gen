    "intro": "Lesquerella kingii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lesquerella, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain oil-rich seeds, which have been used in traditional applications. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
