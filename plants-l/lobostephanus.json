    "intro": "Lobostephanus, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plants are shrubs that typically grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. They are characterized by their small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Lobostephanus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardy nature and aesthetic features."
