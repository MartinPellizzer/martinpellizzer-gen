    "intro": "Leymus arjinshanicus subsp. ruoqiangensis, commonly known as the Ruoqiang Leymus, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in semi-desert and desert-steppe ecosystems. This subspecies is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential for use in restoration projects in arid environments."
