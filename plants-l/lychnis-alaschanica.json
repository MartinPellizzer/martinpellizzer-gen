    "intro": "Lychnis alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaskan fireweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
