    "intro": "Lathyrus curvus, commonly known as the curved vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive curved pods. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in a variety of soil types. Lathyrus curvus is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
