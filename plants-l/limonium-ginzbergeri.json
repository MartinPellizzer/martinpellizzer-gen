    "intro": "Limonium ginzbergeri, commonly known as the Ginzberger's sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to coastal environments. Limonium ginzbergeri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in sandy or well-drained soils."
