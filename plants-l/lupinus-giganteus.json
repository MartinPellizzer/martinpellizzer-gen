    "intro": "Lupinus giganteus, commonly known as the giant lupine, is a tall, flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet pea-like flowers and tall, slender stems. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Lupinus giganteus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. This makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession and a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
