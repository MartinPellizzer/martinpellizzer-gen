It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces cone-like flowers, known as hop cones, which are used in brewing beer. These cones contain essential oils and lupulins, which contribute to the bitterness and aroma of beer. Lupulus lupuloides is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
