    "intro": "Leucanthemum filifolium, commonly known as the slenderleaf oxeye, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate white flowers with yellow centers, resembling daisies, and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a lacy appearance. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value. Leucanthemum filifolium is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
