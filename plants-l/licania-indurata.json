    "intro": "Licania indurata, commonly known as the hardy licania, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Licania indurata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
