It is a low-growing, perennial herb with slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes."
