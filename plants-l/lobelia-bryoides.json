    "intro": "Lobelia bryoides, commonly known as the mossy lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, oval-shaped, and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Lobelia bryoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
