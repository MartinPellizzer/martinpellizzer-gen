    "intro": "Leucanthemum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic oxeye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features showy white ray flowers with yellow centers, surrounded by narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and shores, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
