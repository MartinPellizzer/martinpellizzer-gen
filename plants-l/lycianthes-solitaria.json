    "intro": "Lycianthes solitaria, commonly known as the solitary nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. It is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but have a mildly toxic taste due to the presence of solanine. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the flowers are typically white or pale green with yellow centers. Lycianthes solitaria is often found in dry, disturbed areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
