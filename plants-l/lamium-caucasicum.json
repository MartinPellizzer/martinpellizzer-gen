    "intro": "Lamium caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian deadnettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and tonic properties."
