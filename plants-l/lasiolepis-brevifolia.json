    "intro": "Lasiolepis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved hair-frond fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, hairy fronds that are short and broad. The plant typically thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Lasiolepis brevifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life."
