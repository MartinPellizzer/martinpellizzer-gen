    "intro": "Lepanthes decurva, commonly known as the curled lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a slender, erect stem and a cluster of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are characterized by their elongated, spurred petals and a unique, curling lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Lepanthes decurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
