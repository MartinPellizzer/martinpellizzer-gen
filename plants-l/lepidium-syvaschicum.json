It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as broccoli and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small white or yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Lepidium syvaschicum is often found in meadows and along stream banks at high elevations."
