    "intro": "Landtia, commonly known as the \"buttercup flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, radially symmetrical flowers that often feature a yellow center surrounded by petals. Landtia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They have small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting to their harsh environments. The genus includes several species, such as Landtia grandiflora, which is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value."
