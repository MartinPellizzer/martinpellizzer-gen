It features cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique coloration and resilience."
