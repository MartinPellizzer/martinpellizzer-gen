    "intro": "Lygodesmia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
