    "intro": "Lindsaea regularis, commonly known as the common lindsaea, is a fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Lindsaea regularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
