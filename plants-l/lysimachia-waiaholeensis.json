    "intro": "Lysimachia waiaholeensis, commonly known as Waiahole sandwort, is a rare Hawaiian plant endemic to the island of Oahu. It is a low-growing herb with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
