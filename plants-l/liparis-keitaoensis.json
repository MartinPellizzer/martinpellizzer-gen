It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. It has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
