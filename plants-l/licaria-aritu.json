    "intro": "Licaria aritu, commonly known as the Brazilian licorice, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing oval seeds. It is valued for its aromatic roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss, Licaria aritu is considered threatened in its natural range."
