    "intro": "Lilium pumilum var. flavum, commonly known as the yellow dwarf lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
