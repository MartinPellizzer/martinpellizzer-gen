    "intro": "Lotus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces white or pink flowers that bloom during the day, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it plays a role in water filtration and ecosystem balance. The lotus microphyllus is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
