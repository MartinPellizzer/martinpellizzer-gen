    "intro": "Loasa placei, commonly known as the velvetleaf loasa, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five- to seven-lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Loasa placei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a tropical look in temperate climates."
