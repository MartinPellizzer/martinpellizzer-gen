    "intro": "Lomariopsis boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomariopsis boivinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
