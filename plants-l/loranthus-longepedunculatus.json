    "intro": "Loranthus longepedunculatus, commonly known as the long peduncle mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to various host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming a hemiparasitic relationship. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, yellowish aril surrounding the seed. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates."
