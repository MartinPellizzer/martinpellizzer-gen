    "intro": "Lycium horridum, commonly known as the rough boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Lycium horridum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
