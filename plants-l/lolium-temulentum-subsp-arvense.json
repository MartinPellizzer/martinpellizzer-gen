    "intro": "Lolium temulentum subsp. arvense, commonly known as creeping vetch, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. While it is considered a weed in agricultural settings, it also serves as a forage plant for livestock in some regions."
