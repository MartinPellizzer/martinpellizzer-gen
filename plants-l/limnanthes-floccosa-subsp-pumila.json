    "intro": "Limnanthes floccosa subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf swamp milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has soft, woolly leaves covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture in damp environments. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
