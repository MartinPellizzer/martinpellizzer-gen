It features small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has spiny stems and elliptical, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Lycium sessiliflorum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
