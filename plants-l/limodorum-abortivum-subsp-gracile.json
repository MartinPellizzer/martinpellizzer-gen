    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum subsp. gracile, commonly known as the slender marsh lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in loose racemes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. This subspecies is distinguished by its compact size and delicate appearance, making it a notable but less commonly cultivated member of the Orchidaceae family."
