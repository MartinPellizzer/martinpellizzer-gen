    "intro": "Lobelia philippinensis subsp. negrosensis, commonly known as Negros lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines, particularly the island of Negros. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as mountain forests and is often found in rocky or clayey soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
