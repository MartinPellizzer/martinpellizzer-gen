    "intro": "Lathyrus stipulaceus var. incanus, commonly known as the silverleaf pea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are trifoliate, with small, stipulate leaflets that give the plant its characteristic appearance. Its flowers are typically pale blue to lavender, arranged in racemes, and bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to arid conditions, with hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss."
