    "intro": "Leucospermum cereris, commonly known as the king protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy, spherical flower heads composed of numerous small, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Leucospermum cereris is well adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat and requires well-drained conditions for optimal growth."
