    "intro": "Landolphia scandens var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid climbing nightshade, is a vigorous, woody vine native to tropical Africa. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange with a prominent purple or red throat. These flowers give way to showy, lantern-like berries that range in color from red to orange. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
