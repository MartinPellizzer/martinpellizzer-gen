    "intro": "Loudetia eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a soft, velvety texture due to the fine hairs covering its surface. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Loudetia eriopoda is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
