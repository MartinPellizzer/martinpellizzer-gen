    "intro": "Lepanthes cochliops, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with deep red veins contrasting against white petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its orchidaceous structure includes a slender, erect stem with a single, erect inflorescence. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
