    "intro": "Lachnocephalus, commonly known as the death\u5e3d mushroom, is a genus of fungi that includes several species with toxic properties. These mushrooms are characterized by their distinctive cap, which often has a viscid, sticky surface. The fruiting bodies typically grow in decaying wood, especially in temperate regions. Some species contain hallucinogenic compounds, making them both dangerous and studied for their chemical properties. Due to their toxicity, they are not considered edible and can be lethal if ingested."
