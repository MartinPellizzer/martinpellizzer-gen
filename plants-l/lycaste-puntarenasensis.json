    "intro": "Lycaste puntarenasensis, commonly known as the Puntarenas orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the subtropical regions of Central America. This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors including white, pink, and red. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
