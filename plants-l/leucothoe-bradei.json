    "intro": "Leucothoe bradei, commonly known as the Appalachian leatherleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Leucothoe bradei thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is evergreen in some regions and deciduous in others, depending on climate conditions."
