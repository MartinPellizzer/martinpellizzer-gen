    "intro": "Leonohebe epacridea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Leonohebe epacridea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
