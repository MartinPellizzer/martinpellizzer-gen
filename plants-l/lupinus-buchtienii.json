    "intro": "Lupinus buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant features upright stems with clusters of spiny, pinnate leaves, and it produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Lupinus buchtienii is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and dryland landscapes."
