    "intro": "Lepidocupania fruticosa, commonly known as the silky bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it to conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its woody stems are covered in fine, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lepidocupania fruticosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
