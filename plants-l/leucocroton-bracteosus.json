    "intro": "Leucocroton bracteosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or bracteose croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems and a tendency to form dense thickets. Leucocroton bracteosus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
