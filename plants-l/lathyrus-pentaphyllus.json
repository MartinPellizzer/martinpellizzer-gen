    "intro": "Lathyrus pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leaf sweet pea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Lathyrus pentaphyllus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
