    "intro": "Lindernia aplectra, commonly known as the silverleaf lindernia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems covered in silvery-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frost-like appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white to silver pubescence, contributing to its ornamental value. Lindernia aplectra thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
