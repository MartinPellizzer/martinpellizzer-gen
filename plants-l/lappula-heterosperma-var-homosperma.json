    "intro": "Lappula heterosperma var. homosperma, commonly known as the smooth lappula, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, also known as the mustard family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and has hairy stems and leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, bladder-like fruits that contain the seeds. This variant is distinguished by its uniform seed structure, differing from the typical form of Lappula heterosperma."
