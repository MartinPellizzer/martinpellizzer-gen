    "intro": "Leucojum aestivum subsp. pulchellum, commonly known as the summer snowflake, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces clusters of fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulb and die back in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
