    "intro": "Lindsaea decomposita var. contigua, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that often form dense, carpet-like mats on the forest floor. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as understorey habitats in humid tropical forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spores rather than seeds. This variant is distinguished by its slightly more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Lindsaea decomposita."
