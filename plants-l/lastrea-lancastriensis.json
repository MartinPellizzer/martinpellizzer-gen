It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation areas."
