    "intro": "Liparis gregaria, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. The plant has elliptical to lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming in spring or early summer, and it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
