    "intro": "Lepidagathis sabui, commonly known as the coastal lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Lepidagathis sabui is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
