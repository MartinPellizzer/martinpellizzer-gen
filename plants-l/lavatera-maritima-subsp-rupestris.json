It is characterized by its silvery-green, woolly leaves and clusters of soft pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to salty sea air, making it a hardy species suited to maritime climates. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to xeriscapic gardens and coastal landscapes."
