    "intro": "Lastrea podophylla, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lastrea podophylla is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
