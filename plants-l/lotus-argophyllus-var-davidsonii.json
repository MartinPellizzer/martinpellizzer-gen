    "intro": "Lotus argophyllus var. davidsonii, commonly known as the Davidson's lotus, is a rare and ornamental species native to China. It is characterized by its striking white petals with a subtle pinkish tinge and its velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
