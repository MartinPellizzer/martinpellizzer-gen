    "intro": "Lagenophora billardierei var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf silver dollar plant, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to Australia. It features delicate, silver-white leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact and elegant appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal choice for xeriscaping and water-wise gardening."
