    "intro": "Leucanthemum setabense, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats in its native habitat. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in ecological gardens."
