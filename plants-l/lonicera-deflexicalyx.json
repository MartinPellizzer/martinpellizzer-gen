    "intro": "Lonicera deflexicalyx, commonly known as the fragrant honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed as other honeysuckle species. Lonicera deflexicalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
