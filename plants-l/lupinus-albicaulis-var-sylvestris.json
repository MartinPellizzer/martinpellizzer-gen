    "intro": "Lupinus albicaulis var. sylvestris, commonly known as the silverleaf lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white foliage and tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of violet or purple pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, and the plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
