It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or lilac in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
