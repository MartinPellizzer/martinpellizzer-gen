    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus var. unijugus, commonly known as the single-ovary pea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant features climbing stems with trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. This variety is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological role in nitrogen enrichment of soils."
