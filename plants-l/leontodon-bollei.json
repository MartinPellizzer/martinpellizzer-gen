    "intro": "Leontodon bollei, commonly known as the Bolli's bell heather, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of individual flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
