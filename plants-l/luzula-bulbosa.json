    "intro": "Luzula bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of white or greenish flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has rhizomatous growth and often forms dense colonies, which help stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in forest ecosystems."
