    "intro": "Lonicera vacciniifolia, commonly known as the cranberry bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in late spring, which are typically yellow or orange, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Lonicera vacciniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
