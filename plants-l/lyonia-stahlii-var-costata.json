    "intro": "Lyonia stahlii var. costata, commonly known as the serrated lyonia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that typically reaches a height of 1 to 2 feet. The plant features small, waxy leaves with a serrated margin, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
