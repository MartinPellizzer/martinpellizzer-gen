    "intro": "Loranthus pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating. Loranthus pohlii is native to Australia and is an important part of the ecosystem in its native habitat."
