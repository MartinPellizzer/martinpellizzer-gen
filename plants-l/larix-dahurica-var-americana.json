    "intro": "Larix dahurica var. americana, commonly known as the American larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves in the fall, turning golden before falling. The tree has slender, exfoliating bark that reveals a reddish-brown inner layer as it ages. Its cones are small, woody, and typically hang in clusters, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along river valleys."
