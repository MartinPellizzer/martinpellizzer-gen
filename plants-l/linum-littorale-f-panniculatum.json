    "intro": "Linum littorale f. panniculatum, commonly known as sea flax or coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh coastal environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in textile production."
