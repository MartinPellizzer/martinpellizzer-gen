    "intro": "Lasiopetalum, commonly known as the mistflower or rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their small, often fragrant flowers and leathery leaves. Many species have a prostrate or creeping growth habit, making them suitable for ground cover in arid or rocky environments. They typically thrive in well-drained soils and are adapted to full sun conditions. The flowers are usually white or yellow and are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds."
