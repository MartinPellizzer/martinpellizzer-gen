    "intro": "Lychnophora brunioides var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine lychnophora, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and arranged in whorls, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
