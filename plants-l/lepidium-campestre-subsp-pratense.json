It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features slender, branching stems covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, segmented fruits called siliques. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields."
