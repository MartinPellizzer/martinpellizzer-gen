    "intro": "Leucanthemum canescens, commonly known as the frostweed or blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like white flowers with yellow centers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
