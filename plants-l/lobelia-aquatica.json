    "intro": "Lobelia aquatica, commonly known as water lobelia, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, erect stems that often grow up to 2 feet tall, with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist or aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soil makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
