    "intro": "Lachnaea rupestris, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant forms a dense, crust-like growth that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in rocky ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health."
