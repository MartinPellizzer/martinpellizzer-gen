It is characterized by its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Lantana odorata is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant scent, which can vary depending on the time of day."
