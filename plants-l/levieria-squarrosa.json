    "intro": "Levieria squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly false heather, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid native environment. Levieria squarrosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
