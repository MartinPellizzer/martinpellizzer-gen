    "intro": "Lissochilus cornigerus, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
