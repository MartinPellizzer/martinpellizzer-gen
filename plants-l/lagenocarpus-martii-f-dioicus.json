    "intro": "Lagenocarpus martii f. dioicus, commonly known as the dioecious form of the genus Lagenocarpus, is a rare and unique plant species within the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its distinct sexual dimorphism, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a waxy surface. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unusual reproductive biology and ecological niche."
