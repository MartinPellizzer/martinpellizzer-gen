    "intro": "Lycopodioides poeppigiana, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that produces spores rather than seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. It has a primitive structure, with a root system and a stem that bears leaves in whorls. Lycopodioides poeppigiana plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range."
