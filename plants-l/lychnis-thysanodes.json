    "intro": "Lychnis thysanodes, commonly known as the tawny moorgrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its small, pink to reddish-purple flowers are clustered in loose, terminal spikes, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its often-waterlogged environment."
