    "intro": "Luzula spicata subsp. brevispicata, commonly known as the slender spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, often in wet or semi-wet soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of *Luzula spicata*."
