    "intro": "Luzula macrotricha, commonly known as the tall wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often exceed 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to greenish flowers. Its leaves are linear, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue due to a waxy coating. Luzula macrotricha is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
