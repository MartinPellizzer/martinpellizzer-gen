    "intro": "Liparis tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
