    "intro": "Lessingianthus coriaceus, commonly known as the roughlessingia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained soils and full sun."
