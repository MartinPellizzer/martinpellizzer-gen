    "intro": "Lindernia cymulosa, commonly known as the clustered lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Lindernia cymulosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce multiple blooms throughout the growing season."
