    "intro": "Lotus sulphureus, commonly known as the golden lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in summer and attract various pollinators. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters. Lotus sulphureus is often cultivated in ponds and gardens for its ornamental value and symbolic significance in some cultures. Its unique color and habitat make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
