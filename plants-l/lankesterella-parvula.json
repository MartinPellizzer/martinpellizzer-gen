    "intro": "Lankesterella parvula, commonly known as the small liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Lankesterella parvula is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
