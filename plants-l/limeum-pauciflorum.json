    "intro": "Limeum pauciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered lime, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when they turn a deep red color. Limeum pauciflorum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
