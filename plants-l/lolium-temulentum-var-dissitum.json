    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. dissitum, commonly known as the slender goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, three-angled seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is closely related to other Lolium species and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
