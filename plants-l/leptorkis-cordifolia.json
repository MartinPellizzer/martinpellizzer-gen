    "intro": "Leptorkis cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety and have a dark green color with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
