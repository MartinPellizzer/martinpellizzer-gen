    "intro": "Lamourouxia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky lamourouxia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its sticky secretions, which cover the leaves and stems, are thought to deter herbivores and reduce water loss. Lamourouxia viscosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments."
