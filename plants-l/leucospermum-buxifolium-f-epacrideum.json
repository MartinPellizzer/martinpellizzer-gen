The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and resemble those of boxwood, giving it its specific epithet \"buxifolium.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. The floral display is particularly striking, with its cup-shaped blooms resembling miniature sunflowers."
