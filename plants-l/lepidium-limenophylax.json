    "intro": "Lepidium limenophylax, commonly known as the coastal cress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern South America. It is a small annual herb with a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a type of dry fruit that splits open to release the seeds. Lepidium limenophylax is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
