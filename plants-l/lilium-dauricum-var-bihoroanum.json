    "intro": "Lilium dauricum var. bihoroanum, commonly known as the Bihoroan lily, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
