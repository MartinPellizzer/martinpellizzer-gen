    "intro": "Leontopodium meredithae, commonly known as the Meredith's edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Italian Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a central cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments with low temperatures and high UV exposure. Its growth is slow, and it is often found in sparse vegetation zones. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
