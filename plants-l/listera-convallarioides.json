    "intro": "Listera convallarioides, commonly known as the heartleaf wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland environments, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its leaves are usually covered with a fine, waxy coating, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Listera convallarioides is also known for its aromatic leaves, which emit a subtle, wintergreen scent when crushed."
