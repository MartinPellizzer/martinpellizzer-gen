    "intro": "Lepanthes sabinadaleyana, commonly known as the Sabinadale orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
