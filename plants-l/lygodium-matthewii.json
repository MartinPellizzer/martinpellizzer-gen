    "intro": "Lygodium matthewii, commonly known as the Matthew's climbing fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, frond-like structures that resemble the leaves of true ferns, though it belongs to the order Osmundales. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, often climbing or spreading over other vegetation, and its fronds are typically divided into numerous small, linear segments. Lygodium matthewii is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
