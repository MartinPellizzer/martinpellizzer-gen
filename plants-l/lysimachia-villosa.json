    "intro": "Lysimachia villosa, commonly known as hairy yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features wiry, often hairy stems that bear small, bright yellow flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
