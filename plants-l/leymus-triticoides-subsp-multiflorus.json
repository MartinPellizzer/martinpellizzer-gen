    "intro": "Leymus triticoides subsp. multiflorus, commonly known as the wheatgrass meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, with small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This species is often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides, contributing to its ecological versatility."
