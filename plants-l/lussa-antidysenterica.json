    "intro": "Lussa antidysenterica, commonly known as the dysentery plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine for their antidiarrheal properties. Its medicinal value is primarily attributed to the presence of alkaloids and other bioactive compounds. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
