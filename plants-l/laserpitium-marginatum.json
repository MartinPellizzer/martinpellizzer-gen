    "intro": "Laserpitium marginatum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive white margin that gives it its common name. Laserpitium marginatum produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
