    "intro": "Lecythis davisii, commonly known as the Davis's lucuma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the Amazon rainforests of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces heavy, woody fruits that contain edible seeds. The fruit's outer layer, or aril, is often used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Lecythis davisii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
