    "intro": "Leucothoe acicularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Leucothoe acicularis is also valued for its ability to tolerate moist, acidic soils and its slow growth rate."
