    "intro": "Lecanopteris novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand hakea, is a fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Lecanopteris novae-zealandiae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
