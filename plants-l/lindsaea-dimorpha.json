    "intro": "Lindsaea dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Lindsaea dimorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
