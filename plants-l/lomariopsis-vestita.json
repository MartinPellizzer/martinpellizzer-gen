    "intro": "Lomariopsis vestita, commonly known as the naked lomariopsis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are borne in compact, fertile clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
