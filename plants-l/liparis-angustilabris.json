    "intro": "Liparis angustilabris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Liparis angustilabris is part of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
