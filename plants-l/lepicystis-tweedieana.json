    "intro": "Lepicystis tweedieana, commonly known as the Stewart's lepicystis, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
