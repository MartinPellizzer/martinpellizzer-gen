    "intro": "Loranthus dregei var. nyasicus, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Terminalia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It is native to regions of sub-Saharan Africa and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its ecological role includes supporting local biodiversity through mutualistic relationships with its host and pollinators."
