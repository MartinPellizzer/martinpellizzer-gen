    "intro": "Leucojum longifolium, commonly known as the white squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, star-like blossoms that bloom before the leaves appear. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Leucojum longifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize over time."
