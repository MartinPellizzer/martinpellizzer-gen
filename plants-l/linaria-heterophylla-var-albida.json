    "intro": "Linaria heterophylla var. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered horned poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually linear or lance-shaped, and the plant is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate."
