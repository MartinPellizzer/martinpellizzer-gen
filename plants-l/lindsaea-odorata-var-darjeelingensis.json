    "intro": "Lindsaea odorata var. darjeelingensis, commonly known as the Darjeeling fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
