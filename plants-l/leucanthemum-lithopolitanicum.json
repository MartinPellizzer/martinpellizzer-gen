    "intro": "Leucanthemum lithopolitanicum, commonly known as the Lithuanian ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
