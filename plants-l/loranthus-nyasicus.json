    "intro": "Loranthus nyasicus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine."
