    "intro": "Lemaireocereus eburneus, commonly known as the white star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing, sprawling plant with a distinctive appearance characterized by its pale green stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are ribbed and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
