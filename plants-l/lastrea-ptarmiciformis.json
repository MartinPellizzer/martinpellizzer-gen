    "intro": "Lastrea ptarmiciformis, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its stem to survive prolonged droughts. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found growing in rocky soils."
