    "intro": "Lappula affinis, commonly known as lesser lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in loose spikes. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Lappula affinis is often found in moist to moderately dry environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
