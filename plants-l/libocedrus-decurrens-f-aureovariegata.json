It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features a striking golden-yellow variegation on the leaves. The plant is a coniferous evergreen with a conical shape and can grow up to 30 meters tall. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in crossed pairs, typical of the Cupressaceae family. The bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental appeal."
