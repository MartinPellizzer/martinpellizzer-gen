    "intro": "Libanotis spodotrichoma, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be challenging to grow in non-native environments."
