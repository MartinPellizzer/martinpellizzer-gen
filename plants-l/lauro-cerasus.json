It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red or black berries that are edible but often bitter. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
