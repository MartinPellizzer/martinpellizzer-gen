    "intro": "Lomaria ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, glossy, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, making it a hardy and resilient ground cover. Lomaria ensiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
