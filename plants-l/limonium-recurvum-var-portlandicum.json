    "intro": "Limonium recurvum var. portlandicum, commonly known as the Portland sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its silver-blue foliage that is covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense clumps, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
