    "intro": "Lycianthes cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-fruited physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant produces distinctive, inflated calyces that enclose its berries, which are typically orange or yellow in color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, though caution is advised due to its membership in the Solanaceae family, which includes some toxic species."
