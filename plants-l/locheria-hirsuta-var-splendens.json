    "intro": "Locheria hirsuta var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendour Lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. The plant exhibits a thallus structure that is typically crust-like or foliose, with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. Its growth is slow, and it plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
