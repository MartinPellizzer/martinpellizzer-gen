    "intro": "Lilium huidongense, commonly known as the Huidong lily, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple blotch at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments in mountainous regions. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
