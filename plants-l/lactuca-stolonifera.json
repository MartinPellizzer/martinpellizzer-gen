    "intro": "Lactuca stolonifera, commonly known as slender lettuce or stoloniferous lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its rosette of upright, narrow, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Lactuca stolonifera is generally considered a weed but can be cultivated for its edible leaves in some regions."
