    "intro": "Lupinus micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus micranthus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. It is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in agricultural settings."
