    "intro": "Lygeum spathaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Lygeum spathaceum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
