    "intro": "Loranthus edanoi, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. It is native to various regions of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
