It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is native to temperate regions of Asia. The subspecies f. glabra is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves, which set it apart from the typical hairy form of the species. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
