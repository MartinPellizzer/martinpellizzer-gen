    "intro": "Lycopodium tetragonostachyum var. major, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to several meters in height, making it one of the largest members of the clubmoss family. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, and it bears sporophylls that enclose the spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. Its reproductive structures are essential for its propagation and are adapted for spore dispersal in humid conditions."
