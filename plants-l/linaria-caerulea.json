    "intro": "Linaria caerulea, commonly known as blue toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bright blue to violet flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Linaria caerulea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it can be invasive in some areas."
