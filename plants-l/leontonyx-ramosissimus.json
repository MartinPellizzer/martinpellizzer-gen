    "intro": "Leontonyx ramosissimus, commonly known as the hairy leontonyx, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branched stems covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water and withstand high temperatures. Leontonyx ramosissimus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
