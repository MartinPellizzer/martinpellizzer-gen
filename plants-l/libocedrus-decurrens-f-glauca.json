    "intro": "Libocedrus decurrens f. glauca, commonly known as the blue-leaf incense cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that often has a bluish-gray hue, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals, and are typically 1\u20132 inches long. Its cones are small, woody, and contain edible seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
