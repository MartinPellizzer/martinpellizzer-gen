It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, succulent stems. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with fleshy, ribbed leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Launaea divaricata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
