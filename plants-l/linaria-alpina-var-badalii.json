    "intro": "Linaria alpina var. badalii, commonly known as the Alpine toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native range."
