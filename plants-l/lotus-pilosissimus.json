    "intro": "Lotus pilosissimus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
