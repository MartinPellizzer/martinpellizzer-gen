    "intro": "Lepidium bidentoides var. pacificum, commonly known as Pacific peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, branched stems and toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Pacific peppergrass plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
