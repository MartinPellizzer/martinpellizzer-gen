    "intro": "Ludwigia stolonifera, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on long, thin stalks. Ludwigia stolonifera spreads through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. It is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
