    "intro": "Lithops otzeniana, commonly known as the \"Living Stone,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, stone-like appearance, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces tall, slender stems with small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its unique morphology helps it blend into its surroundings, providing camouflage from herbivores."
