    "intro": "Lupinus taurimortuus, commonly known as the Taurian lupine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Lupinus taurimortuus is adapted to poor, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
