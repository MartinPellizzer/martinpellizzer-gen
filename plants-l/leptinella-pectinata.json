It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, woolly leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
