    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and have a leathery texture, adapted to cold climates. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Linnaea borealis."
