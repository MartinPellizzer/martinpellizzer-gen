    "intro": "Lophochloa hispida, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Lophochloa hispida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
