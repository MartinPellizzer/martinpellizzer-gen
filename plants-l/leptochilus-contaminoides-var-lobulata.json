It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with a distinct, lobed appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, clustered leaves are often covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in water retention. This variety is notable for its adaptability to humid conditions and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions."
