    "intro": "Lycopodium tannense, commonly known as the tannic clubmoss, is a species of fern ally belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across forest floors. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in strobila. Lycopodium tannense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich soil conditions in woodland ecosystems."
