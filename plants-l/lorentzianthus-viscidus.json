It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive viscid texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
