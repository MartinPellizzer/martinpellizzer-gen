    "intro": "Lupinus laxiflorus var. foliosus, commonly known as the slender-flowered lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that contribute to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
