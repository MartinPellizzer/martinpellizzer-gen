    "intro": "Liparis jovispluvii, commonly known as the celestial orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or violet flowers that resemble celestial bodies, hence its name. The plant has slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery waxy coating. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in rocky crevices or along forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis jovispluvii is considered a conservation concern."
