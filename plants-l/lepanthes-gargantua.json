    "intro": "Lepanthes gargantua, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, featuring vibrant colors such as red, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the nutrient-poor conditions of its environment. Lepanthes gargantua is notable for its complex floral structure and is a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
