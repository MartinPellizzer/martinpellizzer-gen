    "intro": "Lachemilla fulvescens, commonly known as the golden sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Lachemilla fulvescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
