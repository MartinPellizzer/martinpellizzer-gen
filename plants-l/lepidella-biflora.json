    "intro": "Lepidella biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered lepidella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in spring. Lepidella biflora is often found in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and rock crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
