    "intro": "Lopholaena coriifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has historical uses in construction and tool-making."
