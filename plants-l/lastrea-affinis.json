    "intro": "Lastrea affinis, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid or rocky environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
