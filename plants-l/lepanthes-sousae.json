    "intro": "Lepanthes sousae, commonly known as the Guatemalan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America, particularly Guatemala. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant features delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is often a different color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes sousae is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
