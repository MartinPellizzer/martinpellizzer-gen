    "intro": "Lewisia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lewisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pink to magenta flowers in the spring, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
