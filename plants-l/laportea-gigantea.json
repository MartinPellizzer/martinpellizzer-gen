    "intro": "Laportea gigantea, commonly known as giant laportea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing moisture in its native habitat. Laportea gigantea is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
