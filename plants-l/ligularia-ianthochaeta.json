It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs. The plant produces showy yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland settings. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes."
