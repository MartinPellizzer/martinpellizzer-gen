    "intro": "Lepanthes llanganatensis, commonly known as the Llanganatensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
