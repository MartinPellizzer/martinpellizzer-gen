    "intro": "Lycopodiella andicola, commonly known as the Andean clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. This plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring small, scale-like leaves and a compact, low-growing habit. Its reproductive structures are typically found on specialized stems, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Lycopodiella andicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages."
