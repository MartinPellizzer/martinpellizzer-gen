    "intro": "Lathyrus tefennicus, commonly known as the Alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and it has a climbing habit due to its twining stems. Lathyrus tefennicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
