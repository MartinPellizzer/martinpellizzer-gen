    "intro": "Linum scoparium, commonly known as field flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oblong seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Linum scoparium is closely related to the flax species used for fiber and oil production."
