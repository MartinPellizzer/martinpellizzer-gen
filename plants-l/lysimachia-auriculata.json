    "intro": "Lysimachia auriculata, commonly known as golden ear or auriculate willowherb, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that often have ear-like lobes at the base. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants for wet areas."
