    "intro": "Lankesteria barteri, commonly known as the Barter's lankesteria, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, it is characterized by its vibrant, spurred flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in its natural habitat, and features glossy, elliptical leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological needs, it is considered a conservation concern."
