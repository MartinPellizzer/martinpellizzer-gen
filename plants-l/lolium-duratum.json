The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for low-maintenance landscaping and erosion control. Lolium duratum is also valued for its nutritional content and use in forage agriculture."
