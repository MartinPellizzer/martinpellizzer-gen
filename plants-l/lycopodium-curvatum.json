    "intro": "Lycopodium curvatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium curvatum reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
