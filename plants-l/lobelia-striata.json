    "intro": "Lobelia striata, commonly known as the stripeleaf lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its strikingly veined, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lobelia striata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is a popular choice for native gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
