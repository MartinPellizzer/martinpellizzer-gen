    "intro": "Lepanthes aprica, commonly known as the golden dawn orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces pendant-like blooms that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Lepanthes aprica thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical research."
