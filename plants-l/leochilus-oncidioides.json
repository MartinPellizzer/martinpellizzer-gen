    "intro": "Leochilus oncidioides, commonly known as the Oncidioides orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and often produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns on its petals. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree bark rather than growing in soil. The flowers are usually fragrant and bloom during the cooler months, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
