    "intro": "Lebetina porophylloides, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows on moist, shaded rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit with closely packed, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short stalks and produce spores for dispersal. Lebetina porophylloides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
