    "intro": "Lupinus oreocharis, commonly known as the yellow mountain lupine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus oreocharis is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
