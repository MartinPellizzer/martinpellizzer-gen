    "intro": "Leptospermum glomeratum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically from spring to autumn. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Leptospermum glomeratum is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
