    "intro": "Lamium glaberrimum, commonly known as greater deadnettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium glaberrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
