It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are rounded and often clustered at the base of the plant. Lepanthes rotundifolia thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
