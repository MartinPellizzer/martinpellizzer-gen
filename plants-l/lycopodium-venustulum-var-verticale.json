    "intro": "Lycopodium venustulum var. verticale, commonly known as the upright clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting microfauna and soil stability."
