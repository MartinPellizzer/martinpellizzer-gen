    "intro": "Llerasia lindenii var. subcalva, commonly known as the pale-leaved llerasia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard variety. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
