    "intro": "Leptomeria furtiva, commonly known as the hidden leptomeria, is a rare and elusive plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or greenish, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptomeria furtiva is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
