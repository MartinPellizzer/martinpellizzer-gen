    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum f. pungens, commonly known as the spiny clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with small, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, moss-like look. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is distinguished by its spiny, serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other forms of Lycopodium."
