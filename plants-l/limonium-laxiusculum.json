    "intro": "Limonium laxiusculum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stalks and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Limonium laxiusculum is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
