    "intro": "Lotus cantabricus, commonly known as the Cantabrian lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater lakes of northern Spain. It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the lake bed. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with rich mineral content. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
