    "intro": "Limnanthes alba subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the yellow marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are slender and branching. The species is notable for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
