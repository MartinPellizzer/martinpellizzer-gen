    "intro": "Lepidoneuron hirsutulum, commonly known as the hairy lepidoneuron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy or rocky habitats. Lepidoneuron hirsutulum is generally not cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
