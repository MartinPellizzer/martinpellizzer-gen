    "intro": "Lathyrus campestris, commonly known as field vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pods containing several elliptical seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
