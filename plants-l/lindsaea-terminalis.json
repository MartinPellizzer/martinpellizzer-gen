    "intro": "Lindsaea terminalis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Lindsaea terminalis is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them."
