    "intro": "Lotononis galpinii var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate lotononis, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in Mediterranean climates."
