    "intro": "Lobostemon diversifolius, commonly known as the variable-leaf lobostemon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gentianaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its diverse foliage, with leaves varying in shape and size, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often found growing in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
