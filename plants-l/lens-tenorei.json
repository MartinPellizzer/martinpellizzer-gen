    "intro": "Lens tenorei, commonly known as the Tenore's lens or the glassy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, coastal environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lens tenorei is considered a rare and endemic species."
