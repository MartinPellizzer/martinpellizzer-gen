    "intro": "Leptogramma opaca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. Its fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Leptogramma opaca plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
