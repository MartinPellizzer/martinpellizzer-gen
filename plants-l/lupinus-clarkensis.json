    "intro": "Lupinus clarkensis, commonly known as Clark's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus clarkensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
