    "intro": "Lycium rhombifolium, commonly known as the diamondleaf boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. Lycium rhombifolium is adapted to dry conditions, with thick leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
