It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, and is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, oval berries. Litsea borneensis is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
