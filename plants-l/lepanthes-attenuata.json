    "intro": "Lepanthes attenuata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them, and it thrives in well-drained, organic-rich substrates. Lepanthes attenuata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
