    "intro": "Lepanthes grildrig, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a sweet fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests, often epiphytic on trees or rocks. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with limited soil. The flowers bloom during the wet season, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
