    "intro": "Lobivia chrysantha subvar. rubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features rounded, ribbed stems that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
