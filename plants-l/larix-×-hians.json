    "intro": "Larix \u00d7 hians, commonly known as the hybrid larch, is a deciduous conifer that results from the cross between the Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi) and the European larch (Larix decidua). It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow in autumn before shedding. The tree produces small, woody cones that release seeds in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for reforestation and urban planting."
