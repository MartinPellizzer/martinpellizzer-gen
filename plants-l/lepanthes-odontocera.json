    "intro": "Lepanthes odontocera, commonly known as the toothed lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
