It features upright stems covered with opposite, broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
