    "intro": "Larix gracilis, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and delicate, needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that release seeds in the spring. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Larix gracilis is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in boreal and subarctic regions."
