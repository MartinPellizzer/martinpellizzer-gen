    "intro": "Leonotis leonurus var. vestita, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a striking perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright orange, tubular flowers that resemble a lion's tail. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive silver-green hue. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
