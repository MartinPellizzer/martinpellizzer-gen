It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its seeds are small and contained within siliques, a type of dry, dehiscent fruit. Lepidium boissieri is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
