    "intro": "Lomatia silaifolia var. induta, commonly known as the mountain lomatia, is a shrub native to the southeastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, and often hairy stems, which are covered in small, glandular dots. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, leathery texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
