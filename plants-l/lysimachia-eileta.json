    "intro": "Lysimachia eileta, commonly known as the creeping yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters along its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and damp meadows. Lysimachia eileta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
