    "intro": "Lomariocycas werckleana, commonly known as the Werckleana cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Lomariocycas werckleana is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
