    "intro": "Lycopodium minchegense, commonly known as the Minchegense clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium minchegense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
