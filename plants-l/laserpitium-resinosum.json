It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance from its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Laserpitium resinosum is often found in open meadows and slopes at higher elevations."
