    "intro": "Lannea buettneri, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
