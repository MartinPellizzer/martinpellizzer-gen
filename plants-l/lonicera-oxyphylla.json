    "intro": "Lonicera oxyphylla, commonly known as the Chinese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb by means of tendrils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer. Lonicera oxyphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
