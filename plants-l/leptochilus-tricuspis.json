    "intro": "Leptochilus tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are basal, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, blooming in early spring."
