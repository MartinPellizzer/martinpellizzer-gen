    "intro": "Lereschia thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas's lereschia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lereschia thomasii is considered a vulnerable species."
