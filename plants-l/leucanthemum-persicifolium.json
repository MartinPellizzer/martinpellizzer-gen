It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-white, woolly leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
