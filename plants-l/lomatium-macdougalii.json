    "intro": "Lomatium macdougalii, commonly known as the MacDougal's lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
