    "intro": "Lysimachia violascens var. brevistamina, commonly known as the narrow-staminal wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, five-petaled, and typically a shade of violet or blue. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
