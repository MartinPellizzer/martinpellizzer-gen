    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. uplandica, commonly known as the upland twinflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in open, shaded habitats such as forest edges and rocky slopes. Its leaves are evergreen, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
