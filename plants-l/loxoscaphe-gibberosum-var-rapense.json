    "intro": "Loxoscaphe gibberosum var. rapense, commonly known as the roughleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This species is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
