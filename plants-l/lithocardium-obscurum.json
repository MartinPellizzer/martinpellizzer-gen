    "intro": "Lithocardium obscurum, commonly known as the dark lithocardium, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, though it is not a true cactus, instead resembling a succulent with fleshy, thickened stems. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers that bloom in shades of green and white. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, showcasing remarkable adaptations to extreme conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lithocardium obscurum is considered a vulnerable species."
