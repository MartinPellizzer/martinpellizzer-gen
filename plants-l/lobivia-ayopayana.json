    "intro": "Lobivia ayopayana, commonly known as the Ayopayana lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
