    "intro": "Lastrea urens, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red sandalwood tree, is a flowering plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. The plant is known for its aromatic wood, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
