    "intro": "Lysimachia lamiatilis, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves that form dense mats along the ground. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, inconspicuous fruits that disperse seeds through wind and water. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
