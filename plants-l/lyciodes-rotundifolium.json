    "intro": "Lyciodes rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf lyciodes, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces berries that are dark purple when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
