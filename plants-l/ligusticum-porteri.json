    "intro": "Ligusticum porteri, commonly known as Sneezeweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist meadows and along streambanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its scientific name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine for its purported respiratory benefits. However, it is important to note that the plant can cause allergic reactions, including sneezing and skin irritation."
