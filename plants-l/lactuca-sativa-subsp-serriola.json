    "intro": "Lactuca sativa subsp. serriola, commonly known as wild lettuce, is a wild species of lettuce native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems, lobed leaves, and small, green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant contains lactucine and other lactucosides, which contribute to its mild sedative properties. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. While not typically cultivated for food, it has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
