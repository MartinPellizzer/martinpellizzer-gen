    "intro": "Lychnis apetala var. macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded sand-verbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often reddish in color. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the plant. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust seeds compared to other varieties of Lychnis apetala."
