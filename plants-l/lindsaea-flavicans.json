    "intro": "Lindsaea flavicans, commonly known as the yellow lindsaea, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are typically bright green with a yellowish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
