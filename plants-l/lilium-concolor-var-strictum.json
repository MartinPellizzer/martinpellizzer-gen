    "intro": "Lilium concolor var. strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fritillary, is a rare and delicate species of lily native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is a perennial herb that produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
