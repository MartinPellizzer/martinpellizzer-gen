    "intro": "Lactuca flavissima, commonly known as the yellow lettuce or sweet lettuce, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, dark green leaves that are often curled and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but is now cultivated in some regions for its edible leaves. Lactuca flavissima is often grown as a leafy vegetable and can be used in salads or cooked dishes."
