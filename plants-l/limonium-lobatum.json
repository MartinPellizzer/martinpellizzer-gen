    "intro": "Limonium lobatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Limonium lobatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
