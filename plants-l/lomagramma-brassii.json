    "intro": "Lomagramma brassii, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds with distinctive red veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes, which help anchor it to substrates. Lomagramma brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
