    "intro": "Loxogramme forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, creeping stems that form dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are opposite, with a distinctive clover-like appearance, and are often submerged or floating. Loxogramme forbesii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
