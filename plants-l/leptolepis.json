    "intro": "Leptolepis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of leaves and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Leptolepis species are often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardy nature."
