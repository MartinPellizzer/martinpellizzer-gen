    "intro": "Lemna maxima, commonly known as the giant water flea, is a free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its broad, flat, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 1-3 cm in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the buds on the underside of its leaves. Lemna maxima thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
