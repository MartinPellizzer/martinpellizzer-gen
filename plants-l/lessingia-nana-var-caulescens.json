    "intro": "Lessingia nana var. caulescens, commonly known as the dwarf lessingia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its small, clustered rosettes of silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
