    "intro": "Lithocarpus confinis, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a large evergreen tree native to the Philippines, characterized by its hard, dense wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an important but threatened species in its native habitat."
