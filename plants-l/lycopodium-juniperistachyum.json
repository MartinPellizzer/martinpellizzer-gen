    "intro": "Lycopodium juniperistachyum, commonly known as the juniper-stalked clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a low, ground-level vegetation. Its stems are often covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that contribute to its compact growth form. Lycopodium juniperistachyum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
