    "intro": "Leptorkis purpuroleptis, commonly known as the purple-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking purple foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact, branching inflorescence. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is challenging to cultivate outside its native range."
