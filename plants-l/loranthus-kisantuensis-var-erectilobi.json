    "intro": "Loranthus kisantuensis var. erectilobi, commonly known as the Congo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays a unique ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the forest canopy."
