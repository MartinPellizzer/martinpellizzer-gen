    "intro": "Lycopodium reflexum var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing strobili, or cones, that are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its more rigid and upright foliage compared to other forms of Lycopodium reflexum."
