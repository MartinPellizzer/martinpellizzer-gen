    "intro": "Lucilia macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed flesh fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its robust body and distinctive, large head with prominent eyes. The plant is not a botanical species but a fly, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Its larvae are often found on decaying organic matter, playing a role in decomposition. This species is commonly associated with carrion and can be a significant pest in certain environments."
