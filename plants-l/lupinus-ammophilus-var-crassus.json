    "intro": "Lupinus ammophilus var. crassus, commonly known as the thick-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, thick foliage and erect, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments due to its salt tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its deep root system."
