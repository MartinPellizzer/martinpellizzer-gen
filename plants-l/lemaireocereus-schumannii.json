It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
