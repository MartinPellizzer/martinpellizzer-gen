    "intro": "Lepidium olgae, commonly known as the Olgas wall cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, pinnately lobed leaves and clusters of tiny white or yellow flowers. It produces small, spherical fruits called siliques, which contain several seeds. Lepidium olgae is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
