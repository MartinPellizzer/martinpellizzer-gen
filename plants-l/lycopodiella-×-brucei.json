    "intro": "Lycopodiella \u00d7 brucei, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Lycopodiella cernua and Lycopodiella cernua var. filiformis. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that are typically short and stout, with spore-producing structures called sporangia located at their tips. Lycopodiella \u00d7 brucei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studies on hybridization and evolutionary biology in the Lycopodiaceae family."
