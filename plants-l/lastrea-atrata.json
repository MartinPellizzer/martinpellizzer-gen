    "intro": "Lastrea atrata, commonly known as the black-leaved stapeliad, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically dark green to black in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces unique, hood-like flowers that are often yellow or orange, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Lastrea atrata is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
