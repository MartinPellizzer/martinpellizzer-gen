    "intro": "Lecythis pohlii, commonly known as the Amazonian tucum pohlii, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The tree produces a heavy, aromatic fruit with a hard, woody shell enclosing a sweet, creamy pulp. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky husk, making them challenging to extract. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
