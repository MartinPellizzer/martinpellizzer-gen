    "intro": "Lepanthes stelidipetala, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically feature white or pale-colored petals. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Lepanthes stelidipetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
