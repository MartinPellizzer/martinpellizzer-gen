    "intro": "Lupinus luteus subvar. taranuchoi, commonly known as the Taranachuco lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and bipinnate leaves, typical of the legume family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
