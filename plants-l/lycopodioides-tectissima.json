    "intro": "Lycopodioides tectissima, commonly known as the rock lycopod, is a species of clubmoss that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in spirals around its stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Lycopodioides tectissima is often found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous areas with acidic soil. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
