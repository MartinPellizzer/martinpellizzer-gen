    "intro": "Lysimachia huerneri, commonly known as the Huerne's chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often accompanied by opposite, ovate leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Lysimachia huerneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
