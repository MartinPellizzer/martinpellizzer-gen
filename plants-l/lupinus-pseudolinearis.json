    "intro": "Lupinus pseudolinearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with a slender, linear shape, and its flowers range in color from white to pink or purple. Lupinus pseudolinearis is adapted to grow in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
