    "intro": "Leptorkis auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate leptorkis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
