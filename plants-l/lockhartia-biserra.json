It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, contributing to its overall appearance. Due to its rarity and beauty, Lockhartia biserra is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
