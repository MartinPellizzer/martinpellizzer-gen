    "intro": "Larrea microphylla, commonly known as screwwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in desert environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Larrea microphylla is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
