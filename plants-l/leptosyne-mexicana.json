    "intro": "Leptosyne mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for reforestation efforts. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving fertility. Leptosyne mexicana is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in degraded landscapes."
