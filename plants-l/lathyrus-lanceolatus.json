    "intro": "Lathyrus lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus lanceolatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
