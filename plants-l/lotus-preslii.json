    "intro": "Lotus preslii, commonly known as the Chinese water lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, while its leaves are broad and floating. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in muddy substrates at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its flowers are typically followed by seed pods that split open to release buoyant seeds. Lotus preslii is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in traditional Chinese medicine."
