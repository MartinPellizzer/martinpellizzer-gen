    "intro": "Lasiostoma formicarum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants. It produces specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ant colonies. The plant's leaves are modified to create hollow tubes that serve as nesting sites for the ants. In return for housing, the ants protect the plant from herbivores and help with nutrient recycling. This mutualistic relationship is a fascinating example of botanical adaptation in tropical ecosystems."
