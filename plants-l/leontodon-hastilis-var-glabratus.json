    "intro": "Leontodon hastilis var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a robust stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its yellow ray florets are surrounded by a series of tubular disk florets, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage, which sets it apart from other variants of Leontodon hastilis."
