    "intro": "Leiphaimos albus, commonly known as the white leiphaimos, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate white petals and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Leiphaimos albus is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
