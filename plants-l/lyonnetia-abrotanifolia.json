    "intro": "Lyonnetia abrotanifolia, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are alternate, oval to lance-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lyonnetia abrotanifolia is notable for its milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
