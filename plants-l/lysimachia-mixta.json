    "intro": "Lysimachia mixta, commonly known as yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Lysimachia mixta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
