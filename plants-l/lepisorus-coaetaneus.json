    "intro": "Lepisorus coaetaneus, commonly known as the clustered forest fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and possesses elongated, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Lepisorus coaetaneus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
