    "intro": "Liparophyllum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, layered structure with a dark green to black upper surface and a lighter, often white or pale yellow lower surface. The plant is characterized by its broad, leaf-like lobes that can grow up to several centimeters in length. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate and subarctic regions. Liparophyllum latifolium plays an important role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
