    "intro": "Leucomeris scandens, commonly known as the climbing corymbia, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in corymbs, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
