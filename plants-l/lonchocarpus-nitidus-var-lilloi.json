    "intro": "Lonchocarpus nitidus var. lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut in response to touch, a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces distinctive yellow to orange flowers followed by pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
