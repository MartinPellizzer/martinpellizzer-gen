    "intro": "Luma adenocarpa, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and opposite, palmate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The plant has cultural significance in some regions and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
