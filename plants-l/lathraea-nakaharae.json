    "intro": "Lathraea nakaharae, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit, lacking chlorophyll and relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, with a tubular shape and a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in association with native shrubs and trees. Due to habitat loss and other threats, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
