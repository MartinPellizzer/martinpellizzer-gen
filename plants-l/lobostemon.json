    "intro": "Lobostemon, commonly known as the silverleaf or whiteflower lobostemon, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that often have a silver or grayish appearance due to dense pubescence. The flowers are typically small, clustered in whorls, and range in color from white to purple, depending on the species. Lobostemon species are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or arid environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
