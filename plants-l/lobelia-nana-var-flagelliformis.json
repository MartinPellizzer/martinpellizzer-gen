    "intro": "Lobelia nana var. flagelliformis, commonly known as the creeping lobe lily, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters atop slender stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
