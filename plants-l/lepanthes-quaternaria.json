    "intro": "Lepanthes quaternaria, commonly known as the four-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are known for their unique structure, with four sepals and petals, contributing to its common name. Lepanthes quaternaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
