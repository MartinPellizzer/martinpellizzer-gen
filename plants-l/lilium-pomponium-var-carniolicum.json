    "intro": "Lilium pomponium var. carniolicum, commonly known as the Carniolan lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive white throat. The plant grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a basal rosette. Its bulbs are modified underground stems that store nutrients, supporting the plant's growth and flowering. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
