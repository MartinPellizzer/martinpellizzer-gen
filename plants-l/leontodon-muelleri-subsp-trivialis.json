It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. It blooms from late summer to autumn, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. The species is noted for its resilience and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
