    "intro": "Lobelia quiexobrae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is characterized by its small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Lobelia quiexobrae is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation programs."
