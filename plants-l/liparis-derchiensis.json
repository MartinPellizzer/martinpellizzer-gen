    "intro": "Liparis derchiensis, commonly known as the Derghien orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Liparis derchiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
