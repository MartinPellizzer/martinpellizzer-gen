    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. wibbei, commonly known as the Wibbe's clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its distinctive morphology and is often found in specific geographic regions with suitable microclimates."
