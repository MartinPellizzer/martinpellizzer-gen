It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are predominantly silver with a greenish margin. The plant is known for its ornamental value, particularly in shaded garden settings. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring. This variety is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its flowers."
