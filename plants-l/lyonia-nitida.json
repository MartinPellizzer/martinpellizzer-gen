    "intro": "Lyonia nitida, commonly known as the glossy lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, providing an attractive appearance in both summer and winter. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, which are usually white or pale green. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a border plant. Lyonia nitida is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
