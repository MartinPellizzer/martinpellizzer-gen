    "intro": "Lepanthes quetzalensis, commonly known as the Quetzal orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that often display a combination of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. Lepanthes quetzalensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological significance in its native habitat."
