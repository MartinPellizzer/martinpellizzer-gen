    "intro": "Linum alpinum var. obtusatum, commonly known as the Alpine flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variety is a member of the Linaceae family and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
