It is native to the high-altitude regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. This plant is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces large, showy flowers with a wide range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The leaves are broad and grass-like, and the plant thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
