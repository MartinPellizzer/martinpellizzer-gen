    "intro": "Lathraea clandestina f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a fleshy, branched structure. The plant produces small, pink or rose-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to southern Europe and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its unique appearance and parasitic nature, it is considered an interesting and somewhat rare botanical specimen."
