    "intro": "Lappula barbata subsp. aragonense, commonly known as the Aragon beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, club-shaped capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
