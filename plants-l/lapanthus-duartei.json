    "intro": "Lapanthus duartei, commonly known as the Duarte's lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its bulbs are an important part of its life cycle, storing nutrients for periods of dormancy. Due to habitat loss, Lapanthus duartei is considered a rare and endangered species."
