    "intro": "Lacistema grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf lacistema, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with a velvety texture and dark green color. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
