    "intro": "Loranthus natalitius var. minor, commonly known as the Natal mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its hemiparasitic relationship with its host. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees for dispersal. This species is native to southern Africa and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas."
