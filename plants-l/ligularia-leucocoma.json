    "intro": "Ligularia leucocoma, commonly known as the white ligularia, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in loose, flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
