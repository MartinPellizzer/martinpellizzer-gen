    "intro": "Limnophila morgania, commonly known as the water starwort, is a species of flowering plant in the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, Southeast Asia, and Australia. This aquatic plant typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color. Limnophila morgania plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
