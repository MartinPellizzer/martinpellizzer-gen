    "intro": "Lithops divergens, commonly known as the \"dwarf ice plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the winter months. Its leaves store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Lithops divergens is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
