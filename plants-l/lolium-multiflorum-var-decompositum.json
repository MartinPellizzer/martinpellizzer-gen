    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. decompositum, commonly known as the decomposed ryegrass, is a variant of the annual ryegrass species. It is characterized by its reduced floral structure and smaller, often sterile inflorescences compared to the typical form. This variant is typically found in disturbed soils and is often associated with agricultural fields. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a basal growth habit. Due to its limited reproductive capacity, it is less commonly cultivated but may persist in natural or managed ecosystems."
