    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. macranthus, commonly known as the marsh vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ascending stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that mature into a dark brown color, and the plant is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Lathyrus palustris var. macranthus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
