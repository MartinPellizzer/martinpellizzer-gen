It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, fleshy, ovate leaf. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with several white to pale yellow flowers that have a distinctive, intricate structure. Lepanthes epibator thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and montane forests. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in the study of orchid diversity and adaptation."
