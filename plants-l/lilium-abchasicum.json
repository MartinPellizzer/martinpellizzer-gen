    "intro": "Lilium abchasicum, commonly known as the Abkhazian lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Abkhazia. It is characterized by its striking pink to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is sturdy and supports the flower spikes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
