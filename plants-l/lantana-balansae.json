    "intro": "Lantana balansae, commonly known as the Balansa lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The flowers are usually yellow or orange in color and are borne in terminal panicles, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lantana balansae is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. However, it can also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora."
