    "intro": "Limnophila aromatica, commonly known as sweetflag, is a flowering plant native to wetland regions of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, strap-like leaves and small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in spikes. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Limnophila aromatica plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
