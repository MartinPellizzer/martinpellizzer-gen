    "intro": "Lycopersicon esculentum var. cerasiforme, commonly known as the cherry tomato, is a variant of the domesticated tomato characterized by its small, round, and often red fruits. The plant is an annual herbaceous species that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are yellow and five-petaled, typical of the Solanaceae family, and they give way to the distinctive cherry-shaped fruits. The fruits are typically harvested when fully colored, and they are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. This variety is widely cultivated for its flavor and use in culinary applications."
