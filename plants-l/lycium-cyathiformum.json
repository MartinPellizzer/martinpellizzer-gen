    "intro": "Lycium cyathiformum, commonly known as the desert\u67b8\u675e or desert wolfberry, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy fruits. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its berries are typically orange-red when ripe and are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. Lycium cyathiformum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
