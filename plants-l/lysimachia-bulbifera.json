    "intro": "Lysimachia bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous yellow mosquito plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, yellow, tubular flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to produce bulbils, which are small plantlets that form at the base of the stems. These bulbils allow for vegetative propagation, making the plant easy to cultivate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
