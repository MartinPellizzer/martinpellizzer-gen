    "intro": "Lomaria fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandez's lomaria, is a rare fern species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
