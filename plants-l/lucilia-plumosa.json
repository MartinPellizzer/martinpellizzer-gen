    "intro": "Lucilia plumosa, commonly known as the hairy flesh fly, is a species of fly found in various parts of the world. It belongs to the family Calliphoridae, which includes blow flies and flesh flies. The plant is not a true plant but a fly, so it does not have botanical features like leaves, stems, or roots. Instead, it is characterized by its hairy body and metallic coloration. Lucilia plumosa plays a role in decomposition and is often found near decaying organic matter."
