    "intro": "Limniris munzii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and forest edges. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Limniris munzii is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in areas with well-drained soil."
