It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Lesquerella gracilis var. pilosa is known for its potential in biofuel production due to its high oil content."
