    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 brownii, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a hybrid plant in the genus Lonicera, belonging to the family Caprifoliaceae. It is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in pairs along the stems. It is native to East Asia but has been introduced to various parts of the world, where it can become invasive in certain environments. The berries that follow the flowers are small, red, and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed by humans as other honeysuckle species."
