    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. atrovirens, commonly known as the dark-green privet, is a variety of the common privet shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, fleshy berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to form thick hedges. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may outcompete native plant species."
