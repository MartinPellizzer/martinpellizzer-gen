    "intro": "Leucothoe subrotunda var. pistrix, commonly known as the southern waxplant, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
