    "intro": "Lepanthes ciliisepala, commonly known as the ciliate-sepal orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with small, brightly colored flowers. Lepanthes ciliisepala thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of tropical rainforests."
