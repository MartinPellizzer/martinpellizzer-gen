    "intro": "Loranthus mannii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the African continent. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating its spread. Loranthus mannii plays a role in the ecological system by providing food for certain birds and insects."
