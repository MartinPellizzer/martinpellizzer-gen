    "intro": "Lindmania geniculata var. minor, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
