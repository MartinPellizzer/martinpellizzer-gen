It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb that is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-drained soil."
