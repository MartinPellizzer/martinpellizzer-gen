    "intro": "Lonicera punicea, commonly known as the red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The red honeysuckle also bears red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals."
