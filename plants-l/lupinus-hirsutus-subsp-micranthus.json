    "intro": "Lupinus hirsutus subsp. micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and narrow, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Lupinus hirsutus subsp. micranthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
