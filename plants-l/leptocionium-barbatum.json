    "intro": "Leptocionium barbatum, commonly known as the hairy leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are narrow and linear with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its fibrous roots are often harvested for culinary use, similar to leeks, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Leptocionium barbatum is valued both for its edible qualities and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
