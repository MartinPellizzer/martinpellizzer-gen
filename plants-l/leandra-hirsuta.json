It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and aid in moisture retention. It produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Leandra hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
