    "intro": "Lithocardium scaberrimum, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that are covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Lithocardium scaberrimum is a hardy species that is well adapted to withstand drought and high levels of sunlight."
