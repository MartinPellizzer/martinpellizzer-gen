    "intro": "Leptorumohra quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-feather fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Leptorumohra quadripinnata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
