    "intro": "Lycium lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems covered with sharp, spiny thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Lycium lanceolatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
