    "intro": "Lepidium heterophyllum var. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, demonstrating a preference for cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually basal, with a pinnately divided structure, and it produces small, edible seeds that are sometimes used in local cuisines. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Lepidium heterophyllum."
