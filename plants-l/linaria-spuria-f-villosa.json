    "intro": "Linaria spuria f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving the plant its \"villosa\" designation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, daisy-like blooms."
