    "intro": "Lupinus maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus maderensis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
