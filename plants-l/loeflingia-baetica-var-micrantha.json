    "intro": "Loeflingia baetica var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered loeflingia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are usually a pale pink or white color. It thrives in rocky or limestone-rich soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
