It features trifoliate leaves with white stipules and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters. The plant is characterized by its square, hairy stems and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in agricultural settings. Leuce alba is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
