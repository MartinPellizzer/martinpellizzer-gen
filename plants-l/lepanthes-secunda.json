    "intro": "Lepanthes secunda, commonly known as the silver orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking white and green flowers, which often have a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on tree bark or among leaf litter. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. Lepanthes secunda is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
