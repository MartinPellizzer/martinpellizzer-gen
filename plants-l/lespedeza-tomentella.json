It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, grayish stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Lespedeza tomentella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
