    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. candidus, commonly known as the white narrow-leafed lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in restoration projects."
