It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
