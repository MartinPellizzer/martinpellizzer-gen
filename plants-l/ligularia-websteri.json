    "intro": "Ligularia websteri, commonly known as the giant swamp dock, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in marshy areas. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and consistent moisture."
