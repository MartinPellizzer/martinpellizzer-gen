    "intro": "Lespedeza trichocarpa, commonly known as mountain lespedeza, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy, pink to red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for erosion control in native plant gardens. Lespedeza trichocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
