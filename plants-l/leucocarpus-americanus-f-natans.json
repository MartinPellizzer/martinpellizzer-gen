    "intro": "Leucocarpus americanus f. natans, commonly known as the floating water fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its buoyant fronds that allow it to drift on the surface of freshwater bodies. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. The plant's rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while its fronds remain afloat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating that aids in water retention. This fern is often found in slow-moving or still waters, where it contributes to aquatic ecosystem stability by providing habitat for small organisms."
