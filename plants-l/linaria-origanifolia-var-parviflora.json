It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often resembling those of oregano, hence its species name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
