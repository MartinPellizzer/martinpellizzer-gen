    "intro": "Lindsaea merrillii var. yaeyamensis, commonly known as Yaeyama lindsaea, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Its small, clustered spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
