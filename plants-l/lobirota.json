    "intro": "Lobirota, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking golden hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rocky surfaces. Lobirota is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and indoor settings."
