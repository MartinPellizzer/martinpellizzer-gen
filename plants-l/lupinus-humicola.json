    "intro": "Lupinus humicola, commonly known as the bog lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog habitats in North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with thread-like leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus humicola is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. It is also a valuable plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
