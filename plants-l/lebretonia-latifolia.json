    "intro": "Lebretonia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lebretonia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
