    "intro": "Lonicera pallida, commonly known as the white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are predominantly white with a hint of yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that matures in the fall, providing food for birds and small mammals. Lonicera pallida is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
