It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
