    "intro": "Lappula cinerea, commonly known as gray lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, marshes, and damp meadows. The plant has a slender, branching stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from June to August. The seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed, hairy capsule, which aids in wind dispersal."
