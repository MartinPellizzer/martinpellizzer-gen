    "intro": "Licuala steinii, commonly known as the giant pandan, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright yellow spadices, which are often used in traditional floral arrangements. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. The plant is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine."
