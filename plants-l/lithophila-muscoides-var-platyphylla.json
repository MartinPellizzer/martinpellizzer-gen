    "intro": "Lithophila muscoides var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf lithophila, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in rocky, calcareous substrates. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
