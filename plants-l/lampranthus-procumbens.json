It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is a low-growing plant, often forming dense mats on the ground. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
