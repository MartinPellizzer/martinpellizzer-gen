    "intro": "Lotodes decumbens, commonly known as the creeping water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters above the water surface. The roots of Lotodes decumbens help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
