    "intro": "Leucogenes leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense white or pale yellow inflorescence, which consists of numerous small flowers clustered together. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, sunny conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions."
