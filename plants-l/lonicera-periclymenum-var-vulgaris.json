    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. vulgaris, commonly known as honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath, and it produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant is characterized by its twin-flowered clusters, with one flower typically being larger and more showy than the other. Its berries, which are orange-red in color, are edible but not as commonly consumed as its flowers. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of nectar for pollinators."
