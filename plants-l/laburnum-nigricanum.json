    "intro": "Laburnum nigricanum, commonly known as the black-leaf laburnum, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow, pendulous flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has slender, arching branches and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other laburnum species."
