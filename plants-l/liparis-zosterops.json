    "intro": "Liparis zosterops, commonly known as the feather-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that resemble feathers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The orchid's root system is specialized, with mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient absorption from the soil."
