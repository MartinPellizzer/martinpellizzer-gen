    "intro": "Lantana magnibracteata, commonly known as the Hawaiian lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year. Its inflorescences are bracteate, with the bracts being larger and more prominent than the actual flowers. Lantana magnibracteata is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
