    "intro": "Lycopodium coralium var. minutifolium, commonly known as the tiny-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces strobila, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its minute foliage and is often found in temperate regions."
