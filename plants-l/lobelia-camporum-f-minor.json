    "intro": "Lobelia camporum f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, downy coating. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
