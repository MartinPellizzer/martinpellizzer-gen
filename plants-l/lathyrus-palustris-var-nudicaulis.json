    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender marsh vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats in moist soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are simple, with three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. This variety is distinguished by its reduced stipules and shorter, more delicate stems compared to other Lathyrus species."
