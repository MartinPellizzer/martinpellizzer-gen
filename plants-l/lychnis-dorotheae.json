    "intro": "Lychnis dorotheae, commonly known as the Dorthea's fireweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Lychnis dorotheae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in mountainous regions."
