    "intro": "Leptemon ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf leptemon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
