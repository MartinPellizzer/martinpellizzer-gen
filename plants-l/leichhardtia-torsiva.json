    "intro": "Leichhardtia torsiva, commonly known as the twisted leichhardtia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, twisted stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Leichhardtia torsiva is generally hardy and drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
