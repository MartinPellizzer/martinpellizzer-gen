    "intro": "Lupinus populorum, commonly known as the plains lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Lupinus populorum plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plants in its vicinity."
