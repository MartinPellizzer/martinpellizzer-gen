    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled, needle-like leaves that are typically narrow and somewhat leathery in texture. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. This variety is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
