    "intro": "Lotus schimperi, commonly known as the Abyssinian lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Ethiopian highlands. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and marshes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with a distinctive, spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Lotus schimperi plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water purification."
