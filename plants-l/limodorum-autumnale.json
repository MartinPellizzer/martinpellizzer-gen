    "intro": "Limodorum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Limodorum autumnale is often found in moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in rich, organic soil."
