    "intro": "Lobelia holosericea, commonly known as the silky lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely hairy leaves and produces seeds in small, capsule-like structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Lobelia holosericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
