    "intro": "Limnophyton obtusifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Limnophyton obtusifolium plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ornamental aquatic gardening."
