    "intro": "Lissochilus ibityensis, commonly known as the Ibiti orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Lissochilus ibityensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
