    "intro": "Lepidaploa buchtienii, commonly known as the Bukhtienii bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
