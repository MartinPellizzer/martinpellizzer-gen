    "intro": "Listera brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed twayblade, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. Listera brevicaulis is typically found in moist, wooded habitats and is often associated with rich, acidic soils. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
