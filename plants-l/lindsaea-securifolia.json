    "intro": "Lindsaea securifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Lindsaea securifolia plays an important role in tropical ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
