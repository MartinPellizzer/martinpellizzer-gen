    "intro": "Lycomormium schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
