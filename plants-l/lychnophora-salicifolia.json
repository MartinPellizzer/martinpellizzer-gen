It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name. Lychnophora salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and small, yellowish flowers."
