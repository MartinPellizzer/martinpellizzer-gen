    "intro": "Lachnaea purpurea, commonly known as the purple lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. Lachnaea purpurea plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms. Its vibrant purple coloration is due to the presence of pigments produced by the algal partner."
