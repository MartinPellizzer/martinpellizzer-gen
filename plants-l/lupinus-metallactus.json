    "intro": "Lupinus metallactus, commonly known as the metallaceous lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lupinus metallactus is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It plays an important role in ecological succession and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
