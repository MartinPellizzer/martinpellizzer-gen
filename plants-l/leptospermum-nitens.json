    "intro": "Leptospermum nitens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves contain high levels of flavonoids and essential oils, making it valuable in traditional and modern herbal medicine. Leptospermum nitens is also notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil."
