It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces yellow or white flowers in late spring. Its botanical features make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance ornamental plant."
