    "intro": "Leptosiphon, commonly known as the \"bluebonnet\" in some regions, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Leptosiphon species are typically annual or perennial herbs with hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple. The flowers are often clustered in racemes, and the plants produce small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance."
