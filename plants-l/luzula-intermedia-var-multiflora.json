It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of white to pale blue flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fibrous roots and rhizomes, which help it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
