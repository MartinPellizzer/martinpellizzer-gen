    "intro": "Lastreopsis effusa subsp. confinis, commonly known as the coastal lastreopsis, is a perennial herb native to the rocky shores of New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it survive in harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in windy, saline environments. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the lastreopsis group, which are known for their ability to thrive in coastal and alpine habitats."
