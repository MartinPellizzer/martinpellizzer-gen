It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. Its scientific name reflects its swollen, fleshy stems, which are a distinctive botanical characteristic.
