    "intro": "Lechea patula, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Lechea patula is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the Apocynaceae family. It serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
