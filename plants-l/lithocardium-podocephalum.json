    "intro": "Lithocardium podocephalum, commonly known as the rock heart fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lithocardium podocephalum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
