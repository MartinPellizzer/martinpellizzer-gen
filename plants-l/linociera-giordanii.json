    "intro": "Linociera giordanii, commonly known as the Jordan's linociera, is a rare shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linociera giordanii is considered a vulnerable species."
