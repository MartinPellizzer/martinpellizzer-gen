It is a herbaceous annual with narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern in some areas."
