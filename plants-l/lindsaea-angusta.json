    "intro": "Lindsaea angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include small, clustered spore-bearing capsules that develop at the base of the leaves. Lindsaea angusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
