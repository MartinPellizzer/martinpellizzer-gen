    "intro": "Lobelia cardinalis var. candida, commonly known as the white cardinal flower, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spike-like inflorescence that bears clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in woodland borders and wetlands. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. This variety is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
