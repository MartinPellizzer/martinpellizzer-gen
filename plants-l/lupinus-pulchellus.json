    "intro": "Lupinus pulchellus, commonly known as the showy lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Lupinus pulchellus has a well-developed root system that hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
