    "intro": "Libanothamnus banksiifolius subsp. granatesianus, commonly known as the red-leafed libanothamnus, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically reddish in color, especially during the autumn season. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
