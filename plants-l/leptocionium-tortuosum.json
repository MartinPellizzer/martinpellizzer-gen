    "intro": "Leptocionium tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, inflated bladders used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with a distinctive spurred structure that aids in pollination. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters, making it an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated habitats."
