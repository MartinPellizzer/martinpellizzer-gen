    "intro": "Leucothoe paraguayensis, commonly known as Paraguay waxleaf, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Leucothoe paraguayensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
