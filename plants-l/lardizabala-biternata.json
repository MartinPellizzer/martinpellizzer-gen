    "intro": "Lardizabala biternata, commonly known as the Andean arrowroot, is a perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are rich in starch and used as a food source. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid climates. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lardizabala biternata is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its striking, palm-like foliage."
