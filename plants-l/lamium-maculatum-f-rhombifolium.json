    "intro": "Lamium maculatum f. rhombifolium, commonly known as the purple shamrock, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with purple markings and its clusters of pale purple or white flowers. The plant thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage, which is often more prominent than its modest flowers. It is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread easily in suitable conditions."
