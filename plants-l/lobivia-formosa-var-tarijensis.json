It features a compact, rounded stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
