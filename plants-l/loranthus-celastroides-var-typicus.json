    "intro": "Loranthus celastroides var. typicus, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen foliage. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forests where it forms a symbiotic relationship with various tree species. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-white color, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds."
