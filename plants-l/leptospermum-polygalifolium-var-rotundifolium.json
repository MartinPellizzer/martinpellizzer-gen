    "intro": "Leptospermum polygalifolium var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage composed of small, oval, and often rounded leaves. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a source of tea due to their high content of essential oils. The species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in diverse environments."
