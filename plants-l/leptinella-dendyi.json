    "intro": "Leptinella dendyi, commonly known as the Alpine snowbell, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates. Leptinella dendyi is often found in alpine meadows and is a characteristic component of the high-altitude flora in its native range."
