    "intro": "Lysiostyles epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic lysiostyle, is a rare orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
