    "intro": "Lobivia minuscula, commonly known as the miniature lobivia, is a small, compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
