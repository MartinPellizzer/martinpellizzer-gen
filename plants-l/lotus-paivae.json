    "intro": "Lotus paivae, commonly known as the Malabar lotus, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern India and Sri Lanka. It features striking, water-lily-like flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with a velvety texture. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that float on the surface of still water, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Lotus paivae thrives in moist, sunny environments and is an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
