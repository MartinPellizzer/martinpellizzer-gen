    "intro": "Lathyrus nevadensis subsp. cusickii, commonly known as the Sierra grass vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and canyon walls, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in slender, cylindrical pods. This subspecies is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
