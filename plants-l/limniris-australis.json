    "intro": "Limniris australis, commonly known as the southern marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
