    "intro": "Lycaste macrophylla subsp. measuresiana, commonly known as the Measures' giant spider orchid, is a striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in length, featuring a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native range."
