    "intro": "Lucilia jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's blowfly, is a species of fly found in the southern United States. It is notable for its distinctive appearance, with adults having metallic green bodies and red eyes. The plant is not a botanical species but a fly, so it does not have botanical characteristics. It is often associated with decaying organic matter and is part of the Calliphoridae family. This species plays a role in ecological processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling."
