    "intro": "Lathyrus montanus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered mountain pea, is a botanical variant of the mountain pea species. It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the parent species. This form is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral coloration and its role in ecological studies of plant variation."
