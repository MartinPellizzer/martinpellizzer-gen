    "intro": "Lithospermum berlandieri, commonly known as redroot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is thick and fleshy, which gives it its common name and contributes to its ability to thrive in arid environments. Lithospermum berlandieri is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
