    "intro": "Lophiolepis macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a distinct, leathery thallus with a broad, lobed structure that resembles a leaf. The plant's upper surface is usually smooth and dark green, while the lower surface is white and covered in fine, branching hyphae. It is commonly found on decaying wood and rocks in temperate regions. This lichen plays an important role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
