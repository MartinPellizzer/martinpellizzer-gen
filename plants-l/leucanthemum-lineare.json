    "intro": "Leucanthemum lineare, commonly known as the slender oxeye daisy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white ray flowers surrounding a yellow disc, with narrow, linear leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leucanthemum lineare is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate."
