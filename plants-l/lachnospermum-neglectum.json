    "intro": "Lachnospermum neglectum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant blue or violet flowers, which bloom in the early morning. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a day, and it relies on pollination by insects. Lachnospermum neglectum is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
