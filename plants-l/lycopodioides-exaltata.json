    "intro": "Lycopodioides exaltata, commonly known as the tall clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
