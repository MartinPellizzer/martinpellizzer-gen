    "intro": "Leptopharynx gilensis, commonly known as the Gilan pharynx plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
