    "intro": "Latipes senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water. The flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday."
