    "intro": "Lindsaea delicatula, commonly known as the delicate lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its unique appearance. Lindsaea delicatula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
