    "intro": "Limonia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered lemon tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rutaceae family. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, similar to lemons, though they are not typically used for culinary purposes. Limonia parviflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and blooms. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
