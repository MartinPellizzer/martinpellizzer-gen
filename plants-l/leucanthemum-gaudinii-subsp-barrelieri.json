    "intro": "Leucanthemum gaudinii subsp. barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's leucanthemum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which typically feature white ray florets surrounding a yellow disc. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cool, moist conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
