    "intro": "Lepanthes atomifera, commonly known as the fine-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Lepanthes atomifera thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular subject for both horticultural study and conservation efforts."
