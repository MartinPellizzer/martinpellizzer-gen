    "intro": "Lappula subdecumbens, commonly known as the prostrate lappula, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features a sprawling stem that lies close to the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by smooth, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its simple structure and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
