    "intro": "Lomatophyllum \u00d7 jacquinii, commonly known as the hybrid lomatophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which bloom in spring and summer, come in shades of yellow to orange and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
