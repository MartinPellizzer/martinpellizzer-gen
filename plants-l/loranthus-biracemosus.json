    "intro": "Loranthus biracemosus, commonly known as the two-branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its roots. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of Africa and Madagascar. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a leathery texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which can adhere to passing animals for dispersal."
