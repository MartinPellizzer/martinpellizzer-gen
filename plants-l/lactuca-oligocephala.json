    "intro": "Lactuca oligocephala, commonly known as the slender lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in dry, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, pale green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a single head, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Lactuca oligocephala is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some regions."
