    "intro": "Lonicera brachypoda var. repens, commonly known as creeping honeysuckle, is a low-growing perennial vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
