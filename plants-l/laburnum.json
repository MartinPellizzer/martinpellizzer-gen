It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. The leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets arranged along a central stem. Laburnum species are native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in woodland or along roadsides. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
