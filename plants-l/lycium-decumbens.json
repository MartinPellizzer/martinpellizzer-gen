    "intro": "Lycium decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate boxthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. The plant has woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Lycium decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
