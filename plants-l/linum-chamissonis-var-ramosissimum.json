It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are small and capsule-like. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
