It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Lomaria lineata thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
