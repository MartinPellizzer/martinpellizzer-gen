    "intro": "Loxanthocereus pacaranensis, commonly known as the Pacar\u00e1n cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces bright red fruits that are edible and often consumed by local communities. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent stems that store water. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
