    "intro": "Liparis polycardia, commonly known as the many-heart orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, leafy stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are narrow and strap-like. Liparis polycardia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
