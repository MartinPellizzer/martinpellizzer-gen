    "intro": "Limonium hermaeum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, showing a high tolerance for saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms low-growing mats. Limonium hermaeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
