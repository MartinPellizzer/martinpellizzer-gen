    "intro": "Lactuca stanekii, commonly known as the Stanek's lettuce, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by cylindrical, ribbed achenes. Lactuca stanekii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it distinct from other lettuce species, though it shares some morphological similarities with cultivated lettuce varieties."
