    "intro": "Lotus edulis var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-seeded lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its edible seeds and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source in various cultures."
