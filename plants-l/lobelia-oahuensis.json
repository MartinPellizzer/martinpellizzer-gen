    "intro": "Lobelia oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It is a small, herbaceous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate blue or purple flowers. The species is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts. Its unique ecological role and limited distribution make it an important part of Hawaii's native flora."
