    "intro": "Lotus flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Its flowers are typically pink or white, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. The plant has long, slender stems that root in the muddy bottom of ponds and lakes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
