    "intro": "Lilium pyrenaicum f. rubrum, commonly known as the red-flowered Pyrenean lily, is a botanical variant of the Pyrenean lily native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. This cultivar is distinguished by its striking red petals, which contrast with the typical white or pale pink of the species. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after addition to gardens and botanical collections."
