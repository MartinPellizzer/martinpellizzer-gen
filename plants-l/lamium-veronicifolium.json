    "intro": "Lamium veronicifolium, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purplish underside and produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and pink. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is part of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and has a square stem with opposite leaves. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to wildflower gardens."
