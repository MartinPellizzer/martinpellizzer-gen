It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. This plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its fragrant purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
