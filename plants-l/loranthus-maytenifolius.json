    "intro": "Loranthus maytenifolius, commonly known as the mayten-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Maytenus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through itshausts, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is native to regions of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced leaves and a reliance on its host for survival."
