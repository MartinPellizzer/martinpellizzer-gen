    "intro": "Labisia pumila f. sessilifolia, commonly known as the dwarf labisia or sessile-leaved labisia, is a compact shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack petioles and are directly attached to the stem. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typical of the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated for both horticultural and traditional uses."
