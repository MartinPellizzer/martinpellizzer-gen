    "intro": "Lomariopsis fraxinifolia, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a maple tree. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with bright yellow to greenish-yellow coloration on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. Lomariopsis fraxinifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
