    "intro": "Ligusticum graecum, commonly known as Greek angelica, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum graecum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
