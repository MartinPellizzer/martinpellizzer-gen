    "intro": "Lycopodium liangshanicum, commonly known as the Liangshan clubmoss, is a species of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and a rosette-like growth pattern of needle-like leaves. Native to China, particularly the Liangshan region, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's structure reflects its evolutionary history as a relic from the Carboniferous period. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
