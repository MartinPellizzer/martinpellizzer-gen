    "intro": "Ligusticum candicans, commonly known as the white ligusticum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, loamy soils in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomes and roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The flowering period usually occurs in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
