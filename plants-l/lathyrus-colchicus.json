    "intro": "Lathyrus colchicus, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind. Lathyrus colchicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration."
