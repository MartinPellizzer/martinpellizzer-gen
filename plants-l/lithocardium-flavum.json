    "intro": "Lithocardium flavum, commonly known as the yellow stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Lithocardium flavum is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to thrive in conditions with limited rainfall."
