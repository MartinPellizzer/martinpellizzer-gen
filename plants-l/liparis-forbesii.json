    "intro": "Liparis forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soil in which it thrives. Liparis forbesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
