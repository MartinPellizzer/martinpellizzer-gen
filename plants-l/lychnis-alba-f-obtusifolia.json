It is a subspecies of Lychnis alba, belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture, and the flowers appear in clusters at the ends of the stems. The f. obtusifolia form is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to the typical variety."
