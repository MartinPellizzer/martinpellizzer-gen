    "intro": "Linum angustifolium var. elatior, commonly known as the tall narrow-leaved flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, grey-green leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late winter to spring, which are borne in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its fibrous stems were historically used for textile production, similar to other flax species."
