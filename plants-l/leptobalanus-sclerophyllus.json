    "intro": "Leptobalanus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the rough-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its hard, leathery leaves, which are adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is often found in heathlands and along coastal areas, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptations to arid environments."
