    "intro": "Lippia caespitosa, commonly known as Mexican mint or bush mint, is a perennial herb native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong mint-like scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Lippia caespitosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal gardens."
