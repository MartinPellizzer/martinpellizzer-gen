    "intro": "Leptoglottis hamata, commonly known as the New Zealand sword fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are often bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its ecological interactions."
