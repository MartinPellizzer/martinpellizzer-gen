    "intro": "Leptocarpus coangustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually pale blue to white, and it produces small, cylindrical fruits known as achenes. Leptocarpus coangustatus is often found in coastal dunes and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
