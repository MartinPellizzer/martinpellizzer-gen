    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lyeria microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf lythera, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Lyperia microphylla is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and requires minimal water once established."
