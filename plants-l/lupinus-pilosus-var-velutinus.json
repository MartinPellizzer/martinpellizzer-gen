    "intro": "Lupinus pilosus var. velutinus, commonly known as the silky lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Lupinus pilosus var. velutinus is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
