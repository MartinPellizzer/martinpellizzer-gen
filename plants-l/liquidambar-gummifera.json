    "intro": "Liquidambar gummifera, commonly known as the gum linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its most notable feature is the production of a sticky, resinous sap that has been used historically for medicinal and industrial purposes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
