    "intro": "Leptadenia reticulata, commonly known as African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Leptadenia reticulata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
