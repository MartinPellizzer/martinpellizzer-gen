    "intro": "Luzula micrantha, commonly known as the lesser woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, often silver-haired stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Luzula micrantha thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its overall appearance."
