    "intro": "Lathyrus pseudoaphaca, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
