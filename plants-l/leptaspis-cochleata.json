    "intro": "Leptaspis cochleata, commonly known as the spiral leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped markings on its elytra, which give it its common name. The plant it feeds on is typically a species of the genus *Cochlearia*, which are flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Its larvae are often found feeding on the leaves of these host plants, contributing to their ecological role as herbivores. The beetle's life cycle includes several stages, with adults emerging in the spring to continue the cycle."
