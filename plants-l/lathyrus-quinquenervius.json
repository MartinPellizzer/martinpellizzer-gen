    "intro": "Lathyrus quinquenervius, commonly known as the five-veined pea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
