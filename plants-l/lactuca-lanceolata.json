    "intro": "Lactuca lanceolata, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a slightly prickly texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Lactuca lanceolata is known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
