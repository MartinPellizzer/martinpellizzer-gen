    "intro": "Lolium atlantigenum, commonly known as the Atlantic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
