    "intro": "Luciola, commonly known as the firefly, is a bioluminescent insect belonging to the family Lampyridae. Its most striking feature is the ability to produce light through a chemical reaction involving luciferin and luciferase enzymes. The light is typically emitted from specialized organs located in the abdomen. Luciola species are often found in moist environments such as forests and marshes. Their bioluminescence is primarily used for attracting mates and communicating within their species."
