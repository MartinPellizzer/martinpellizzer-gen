It features tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist ground. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Lysimachia fortunei thrives in shady, damp environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
