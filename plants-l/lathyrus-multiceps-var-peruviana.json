    "intro": "Lathyrus multiceps var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian grass pea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are often used in traditional cuisines, though they contain toxic alkaloids in high quantities. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically grown with caution and is not commonly cultivated for food."
