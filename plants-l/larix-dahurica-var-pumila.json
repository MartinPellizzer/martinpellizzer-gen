It is characterized by its small, compact size and needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before falling. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
