    "intro": "Leptactina tessmannii, commonly known as the Tessmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and unique, elongated leaf structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in late summer or early autumn. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
