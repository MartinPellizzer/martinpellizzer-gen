    "intro": "Linum tenue var. xauense, commonly known as the narrowleaf flax or Mexican flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface, contributing to its drought tolerance."
