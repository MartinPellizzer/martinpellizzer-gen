It is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Japan. The plant typically features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salinity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
