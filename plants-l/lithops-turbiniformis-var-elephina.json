    "intro": "Lithops turbiniformis var. elephina, commonly known as the \"Elephant's Foot\" lithops, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble miniature stone formations, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. Its leaves are thick and crinkled, storing water to survive prolonged dry periods. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and collections."
