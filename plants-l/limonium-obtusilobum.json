    "intro": "Limonium obtusilobum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Limonium obtusilobum is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
