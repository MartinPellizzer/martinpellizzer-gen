It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or gravelly habitats. Linaria patens is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, which can make it invasive in certain regions."
