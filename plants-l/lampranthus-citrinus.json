It features bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding vibrant color to gardens. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers, making it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
