    "intro": "Lycopodium stipulatum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves. It is a perennial evergreen plant that forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively across the ground. Lycopodium stipulatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in woodland ecosystems."
