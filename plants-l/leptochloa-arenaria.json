    "intro": "Leptochloa arenaria, commonly known as sand sedge, is a perennial grass species native to sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil environments. Leptochloa arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland sand plains."
