    "intro": "Lepanthes adrianae, commonly known as Adriana's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the humid cloud forests of Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are often short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes adrianae is considered a rare and endangered species."
