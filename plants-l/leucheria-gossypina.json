    "intro": "Leucheria gossypina, commonly known as the cottonleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it attaches itself to a variety of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while it also performs photosynthesis using its leaves. Its small, white or pale green flowers are often clustered and are pollinated by insects. The berries it produces are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
