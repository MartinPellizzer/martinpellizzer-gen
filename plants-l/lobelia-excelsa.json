    "intro": "Lobelia excelsa, commonly known as the skyrocket lobelia, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Lobelia excelsa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas."
