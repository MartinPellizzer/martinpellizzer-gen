It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with several leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus foliosus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.
