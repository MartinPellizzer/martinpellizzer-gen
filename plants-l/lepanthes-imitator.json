    "intro": "Lepanthes imitator, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that closely resemble those of other orchid species, a trait that likely aids in pollination. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's leaves are usually small and clustered, adapted for its epiphytic lifestyle. Its blooming period varies by region but often occurs during the wet season, showcasing its role in tropical ecosystems."
