    "intro": "Leucococcus occidentalis, commonly known as the western white clover, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small white flowers. The plant is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils due to its adaptability. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil. Its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
