    "intro": "Lomandra sororia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage, which consists of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and rocky soils. Lomandra sororia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-maintenance garden settings."
