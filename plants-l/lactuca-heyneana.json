It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Kenya. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Lactuca heyneana is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
