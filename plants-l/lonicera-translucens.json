    "intro": "Lonicera translucens, commonly known as the translucent honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in late summer and is edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
