It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, resembling those of oregano, which is reflected in its scientific name. This variety is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
