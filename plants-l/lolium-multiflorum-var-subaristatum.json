    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. subaristatum, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained conditions. This variety is often used in forage production and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid establishment."
