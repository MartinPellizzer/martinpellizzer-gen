    "intro": "Lithocardium, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often intricate floral structures and adaptations to rocky or arid environments. The plants typically have small, compact growth forms with specialized roots that help them survive in nutrient-poor soils. Lithocardium species are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude conditions. Their botanical features include showy, often fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats."
