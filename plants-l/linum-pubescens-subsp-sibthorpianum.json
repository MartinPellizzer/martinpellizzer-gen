    "intro": "Linum pubescens subsp. sibthorpianum, commonly known as the Sibthorpian flax, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in racemose inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used for textile production, similar to other flax species. This subspecies is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for garden cultivation."
