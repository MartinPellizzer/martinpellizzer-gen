    "intro": "Lecanopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often brightly colored inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Lecanopteris species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They have a rhizomatous growth habit and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral displays."
