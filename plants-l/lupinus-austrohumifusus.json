    "intro": "Lupinus austrohumifusus, commonly known as the southern dwarf lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern South America. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Lupinus austrohumifusus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
