    "intro": "Lepisorus tenuipes, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the substrate. Lepisorus tenuipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
