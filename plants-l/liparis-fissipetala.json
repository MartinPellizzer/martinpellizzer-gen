It is characterized by its unique, often dissected leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Botanically, it is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid morphology with a single, erect stem and a cluster of flowers."
