    "intro": "Lycopodium phelpsii, commonly known as the Phelps' clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its scale-like leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Lycopodium phelpsii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystem."
