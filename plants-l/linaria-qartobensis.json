    "intro": "Linaria qartobensis, commonly known as the Qartobean toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that release tiny seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Linaria qartobensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems."
