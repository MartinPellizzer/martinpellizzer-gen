    "intro": "Lithops \u00d7 steineckeana, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble rocks, allowing it to blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, rounded leaves, which are often marked with distinctive patterns and colors. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
