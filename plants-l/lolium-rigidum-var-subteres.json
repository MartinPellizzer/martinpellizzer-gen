    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. subteres, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a cool-season grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is both a valuable forage crop and a weed in agricultural settings."
