    "intro": "Lagarosiphon densus, commonly known as the dense waterplantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with some emerging above the water surface. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a potential weed in some regions outside its native habitat."
