    "intro": "Lodhra rufescens, commonly known as the red-flowered ash tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Sterculiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Due to its medicinal properties, it is valued in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
