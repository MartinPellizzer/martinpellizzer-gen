    "intro": "Liabum weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's liabum, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Liabum weberbaueri is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
