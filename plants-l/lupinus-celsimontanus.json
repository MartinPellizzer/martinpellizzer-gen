It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Lupinus celsimontanus plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
