    "intro": "Lycopodiella affinis, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen perennial plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodiella affinis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
