    "intro": "Lithospermum guatemalense, commonly known as Guatemalan lithospermum, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, reflecting its name's origin from the Greek words \"lithos\" (stone) and \"sperma\" (seed). Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough texture, while its flowers range in color from white to purple. Lithospermum guatemalense is often found in dry, open habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its environment."
