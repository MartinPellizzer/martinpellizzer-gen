    "intro": "Licuala robinsoniana, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a large, evergreen shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its broad, fan-shaped leaves. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in wet, tropical environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in terminal clusters, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits."
