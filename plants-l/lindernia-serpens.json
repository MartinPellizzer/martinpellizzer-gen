    "intro": "Lindernia serpens, commonly known as the snake's head or creeping lindernia, is a low-growing, trailing perennial native to South America. It features slender, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of violet or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats. Lindernia serpens is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through runners, making it both a decorative and potentially invasive species in certain environments."
