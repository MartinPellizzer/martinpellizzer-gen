    "intro": "Lyonothamnus floribundus f. aspleniifolius, commonly known as the fern-leaf bottlebrush, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright red, brush-like flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Its unique foliage and showy inflorescences make it a desirable ornamental plant."
