    "intro": "Lepisia ustulata, commonly known as the fireplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lepisia ustulata is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
