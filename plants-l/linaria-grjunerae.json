    "intro": "Linaria grjunerae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Linaria grjunerae thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
