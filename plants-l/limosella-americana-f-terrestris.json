    "intro": "Limosella americana f. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is notable for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
