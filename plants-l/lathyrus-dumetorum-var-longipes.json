    "intro": "Lathyrus dumetorum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed grass pea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of violet or blue, arranged in spikes along the stem. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it bears small, elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. This variety is closely related to the toxic Lathyrus sativus, and its cultivation requires careful management due to potential health risks associated with its seeds."
