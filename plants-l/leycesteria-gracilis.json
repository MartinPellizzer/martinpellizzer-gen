    "intro": "Leycesteria gracilis, commonly known as the slender honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, slender, and often hairy leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the fall, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Leycesteria gracilis is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
