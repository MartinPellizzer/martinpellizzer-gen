    "intro": "Liparis dongchenii, commonly known as the Dongchen orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pale green to white with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Liparis dongchenii is considered threatened and is of significant interest in botanical research."
