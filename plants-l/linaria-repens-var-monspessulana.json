The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange flowers with two prominent lobes, typical of the Linaria genus. It thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its botanical characteristics include small, lance-shaped leaves and a long flowering period from spring to early autumn."
