    "intro": "Lepturus minimus, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Lepturus minimus is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments. Its delicate appearance and specialized adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
