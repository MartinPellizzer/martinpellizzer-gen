    "intro": "Lightfootia tenerrima, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its delicate, fern-like leaves that are arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Lightfootia tenerrima prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for coastal gardens."
