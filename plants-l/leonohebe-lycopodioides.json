    "intro": "Leonohebe lycopodioides, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
