    "intro": "Limnodea, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open during the day. Limnodea species typically have roots that anchor them in shallow water, while their leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The flowers of Limnodea are usually bisexual, with both male and female reproductive structures present. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
