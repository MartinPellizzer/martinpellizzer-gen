    "intro": "Lupinus luteus var. croceus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and restoration projects."
