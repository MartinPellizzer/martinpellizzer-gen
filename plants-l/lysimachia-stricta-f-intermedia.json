    "intro": "Lysimachia stricta f. intermedia, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, flowering ground cover."
