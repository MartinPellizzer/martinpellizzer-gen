    "intro": "Lycopodium praelongum, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is a primitive vascular plant that retains a structure similar to its ancient ancestors, with spore-producing cones rather than flowers. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for microorganisms. Lycopodium praelongum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological and historical significance."
