    "intro": "Letestuella, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that typically feature white or pale-colored petals and sepals. The plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Letestuella species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated for their unique floral displays."
