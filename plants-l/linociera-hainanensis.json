It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cupular inflorescences, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Linociera hainanensis is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage. Its growth habit and leaf structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
