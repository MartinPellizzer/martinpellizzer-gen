It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pale green to white flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
