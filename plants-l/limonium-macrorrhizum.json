    "intro": "Limonium macrorrhizum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and its striking, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Its root system is extensive and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils. Limonium macrorrhizum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
