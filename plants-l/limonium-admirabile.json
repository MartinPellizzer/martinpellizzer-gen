    "intro": "Limonium admirabile, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy coastal gardens. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. Limonium admirabile is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions."
