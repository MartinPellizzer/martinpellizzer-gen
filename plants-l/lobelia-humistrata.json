It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Lobelia humistrata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in moist environments."
