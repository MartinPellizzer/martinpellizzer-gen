    "intro": "Liquidambar formosana, commonly known as the Formosan sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Taiwan. It belongs to the genus Liquidambar in the family Aceraceae, though it is now classified under the family Altingiaceae. The tree is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its fruit is a spiky, spherical capsule that contains several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
