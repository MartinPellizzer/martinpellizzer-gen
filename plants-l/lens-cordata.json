It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along supports. Lens cordata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
