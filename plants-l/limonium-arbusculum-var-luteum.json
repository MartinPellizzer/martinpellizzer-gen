It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
