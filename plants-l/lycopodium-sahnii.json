    "intro": "Lycopodium sahnii, commonly known as the Sahni clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages and adaptation strategies."
