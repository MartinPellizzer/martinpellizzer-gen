    "intro": "Lilium kramerianum, commonly known as the Kramer's lily, is a species of bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a cluster of flowers at the top of the stem, which are often accompanied by narrow, grass-like leaves. Lilium kramerianum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it is primarily found in the wild."
