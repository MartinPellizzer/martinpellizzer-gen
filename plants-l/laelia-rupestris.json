    "intro": "Laelia rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained environments. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Laelia rupestris is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its resilience and ornamental beauty."
