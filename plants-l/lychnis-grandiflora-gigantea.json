    "intro": "Lychnis grandiflora gigantea, commonly known as the giant fireweed, is a strikingly tall perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its sturdy stem. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor, cold environments. Lychnis grandiflora gigantea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological succession in disturbed habitats."
