It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores. Lycopodium setifolium typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
