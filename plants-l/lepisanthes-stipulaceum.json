    "intro": "Lepisanthes stipulaceum, commonly known as the red-flowered stiltroot, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red flowers and distinctive stilt-like roots that help it anchor in wet, swampy environments. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its showy, trumpet-shaped blooms. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
