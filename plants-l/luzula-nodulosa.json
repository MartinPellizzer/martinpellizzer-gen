    "intro": "Luzula nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late spring or early summer. Luzula nodulosa is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting diverse insect and bird populations."
