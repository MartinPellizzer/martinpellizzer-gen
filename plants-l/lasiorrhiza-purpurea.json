    "intro": "Lasiorrhiza purpurea, commonly known as the purplestem sandreed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lasiorrhiza purpurea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
