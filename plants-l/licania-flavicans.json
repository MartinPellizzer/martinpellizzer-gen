    "intro": "Licania flavicans, commonly known as the yellow-flowered licania, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, hairy seeds. Licania flavicans is typically found in moist, shaded environments in the understory of tropical forests."
