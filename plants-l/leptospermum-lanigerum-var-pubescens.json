    "intro": "Leptospermum lanigerum var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
