    "intro": "Lomandra densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage that forms dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Lomandra densiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for native wildlife."
