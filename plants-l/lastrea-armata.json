    "intro": "Lastrea armata, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn red or yellow depending on the species. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lastrea armata is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in rocky soils."
