    "intro": "Lithocarpus nymanianus, commonly known as the Nyman's ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
