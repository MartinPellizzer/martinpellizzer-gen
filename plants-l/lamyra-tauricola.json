    "intro": "Lamyra tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric lamyra, is a rare flowering plant native to the Crimean Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lamyra tauricola is considered an endangered species."
