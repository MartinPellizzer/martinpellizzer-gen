    "intro": "Lyrocarpa coulteri var. apiculata, commonly known as Coulter's lyreleaf, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky soils. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
