    "intro": "Lobelia seleriana, commonly known as the purple loosestrife, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous violet to purple flowers. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy to the touch. It thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. While it is an attractive ornamental, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
