    "intro": "Leucheria salinae subsp. zollneri, commonly known as the Zollner's sea hibiscus, is a rare coastal plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant thrives in saline environments, often found along rocky shores and tidal zones. Its adaptability to salt spray and well-drained soils makes it a unique example of halophytic flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
