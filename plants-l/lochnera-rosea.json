    "intro": "Lochnera rosea, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often tinged with pink, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the bark is smooth and pale grey. Lochnera rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
