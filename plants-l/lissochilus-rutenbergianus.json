    "intro": "Lissochilus rutenbergianus, commonly known as the Rutenberg's lissochilus, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky substrates. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
