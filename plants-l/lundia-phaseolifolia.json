    "intro": "Lundia phaseolifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne in clusters. Lundia phaseolifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit and are dispersed by animals or through mechanical means."
