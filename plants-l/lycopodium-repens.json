    "intro": "Lycopodium repens, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with multiple stolons that root at the nodes. The plant produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the sporangia for spore dispersal. Lycopodium repens typically grows in dense mats, forming a lush carpet on forest floors or in rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
