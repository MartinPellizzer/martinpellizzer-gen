    "intro": "Leandra dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in the rainforest canopy. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Leandra dubia is considered a critically endangered species."
