It features short, cylindrical stems with a ribbed structure and produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care make it a desirable addition to succulent collections."
