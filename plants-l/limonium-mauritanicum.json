    "intro": "Limonium mauritanicum, commonly known as sea helene, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in coastal areas and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to saline and dry conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium mauritanicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
