    "intro": "Lepanthes suavium, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow with intricate patterns, and it produces small, greenish fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Lepanthes suavium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
