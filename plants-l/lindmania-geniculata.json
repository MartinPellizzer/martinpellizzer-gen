    "intro": "Lindmania geniculata, commonly known as the red lily, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround the small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy layer to retain water. Lindmania geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical gardens for its vibrant appearance."
