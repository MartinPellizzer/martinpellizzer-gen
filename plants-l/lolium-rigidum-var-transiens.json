    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. transiens, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern and eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Lolium rigidum var. transiens is an important forage plant for livestock but can also become a weed in agricultural settings."
