    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris var. peloria, commonly known as the \"pennywort,\" is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling small coins. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, with a basal rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. The flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
