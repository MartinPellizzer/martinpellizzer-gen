    "intro": "Lotus subpinnatus var. wrangelianus, commonly known as Wrangel's lotus, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in nutrient-poor soils. This species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal and tundra ecosystems."
