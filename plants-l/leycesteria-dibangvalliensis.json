    "intro": "Leycesteria dibangvalliensis, commonly known as the Dibang Valley honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces white to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, berry-like structures that ripen to a deep red color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
