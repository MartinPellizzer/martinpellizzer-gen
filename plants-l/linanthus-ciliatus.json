    "intro": "Linanthus ciliatus, commonly known as the silky flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Linanthus ciliatus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
