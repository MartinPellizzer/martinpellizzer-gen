    "intro": "Leontodon saxatilis, commonly known as the rock leontodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Leontodon saxatilis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
