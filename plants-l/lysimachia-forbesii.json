    "intro": "Lysimachia forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in forest understories. Lysimachia forbesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
