    "intro": "Lindsaea oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves, and it produces both spores and, in some cases, small, short-lived flowers. Lindsaea oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
