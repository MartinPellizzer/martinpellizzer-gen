    "intro": "Lycopodium fontinaloides var. coronata, commonly known as the crown clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stability and habitat for microorganisms."
