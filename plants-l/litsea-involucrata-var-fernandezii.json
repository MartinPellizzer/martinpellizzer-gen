    "intro": "Litsea involucrata var. fernandezii, commonly known as the fernandezii litsea, is a rare variant of the litsea genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by oval-shaped berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
