    "intro": "Loranthus sambesiacus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa."
