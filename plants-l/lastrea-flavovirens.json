    "intro": "Lastrea flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus that is usually greenish-yellow in color, with a dense, cushion-like growth form. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called gametophytes that perform photosynthesis. Lastrea flavovirens is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid, shaded habitats."
