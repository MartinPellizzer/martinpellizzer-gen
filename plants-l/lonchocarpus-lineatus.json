    "intro": "Lonchocarpus lineatus, commonly known as the yellow snakeroot, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
