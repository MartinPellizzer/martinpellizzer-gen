It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and tall spires of blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
