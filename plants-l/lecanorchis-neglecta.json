    "intro": "Lecanorchis neglecta, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Lecanorchis neglecta is known for its low-growing habit and is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance."
