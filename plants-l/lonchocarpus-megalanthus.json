    "intro": "Lonchocarpus megalanthus, commonly known as the giant senna, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
