    "intro": "Limnosipanea spruceana var. spruceana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada waterleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
