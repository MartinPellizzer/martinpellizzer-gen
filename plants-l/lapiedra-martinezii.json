    "intro": "Lapiedra martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's rock plant, is a rare and endemic species native to the rocky habitats of southern Spain. It is a small, flowering plant that typically grows in limestone and granite substrates, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lapiedra martinezii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
