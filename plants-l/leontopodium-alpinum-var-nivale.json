    "intro": "Leontopodium alpinum var. nivale, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flowers, which are surrounded by a fuzzy, velvety involucre. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry conditions and well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically visited by insects such as bees and flies, contributing to its pollination. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often considered a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
