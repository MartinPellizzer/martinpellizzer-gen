    "intro": "Lycium hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, red berries that appear in the fall. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for birds and small mammals."
