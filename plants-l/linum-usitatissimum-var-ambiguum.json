    "intro": "Linum usitatissimum var. ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous flax, is a lesser-known variant of the common flax plant. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being more lanceolate while others are ovate. The flowers are typically blue or purple, similar to the standard flax, but may exhibit slight variations in color and shape. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its limited cultivation, it is less studied compared to the more widely used Linum usitatissimum."
