These plants are characterized by their large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, dry seeds. Leucophyta species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas."
