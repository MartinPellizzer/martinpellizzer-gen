    "intro": "Linaria heterophylla f. subsabulicola, commonly known as the sand dune linaria, is a compact, mat-forming annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with bilateral symmetry, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
