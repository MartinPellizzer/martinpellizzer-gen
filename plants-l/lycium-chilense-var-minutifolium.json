It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in coastal climates with well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its hardy nature, it is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
