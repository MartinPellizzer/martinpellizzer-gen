    "intro": "Laelia furfuracea, commonly known as the woolly laelia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a unique and rugged appearance. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with dark markings. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Laelia furfuracea is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
