    "intro": "Lomelosia olivieri, commonly known as the olive tree of the Canary Islands, is a small evergreen shrub native to the volcanic soils of La Palma. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling small olives. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in full sun with minimal water requirements. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
