    "intro": "Lopima amygdalacca, commonly known as the almond tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long, and its fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, green fruits called drupes, which mature into the familiar nut-like seeds surrounded by a hard shell. The plant is valued for its edible seeds, which are widely used in cooking and baking. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and agriculture."
