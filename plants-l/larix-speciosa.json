    "intro": "Larix speciosa, commonly known as the western larch, is a deciduous conifer native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its striking golden foliage in autumn. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically arranged in spirals along the branches, and they turn yellow before falling off in the fall. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
