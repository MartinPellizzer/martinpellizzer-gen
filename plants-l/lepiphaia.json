    "intro": "Lepiphaia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, hence their common name. Lepiphaia species typically grow in freshwater environments such as streams and ponds, where they attach to rocks or submerged surfaces. Their rhizomes are often covered in a fine, silky coating that aids in water retention. The genus includes several species, each adapted to different aquatic conditions, making them an interesting subject for botanical study."
