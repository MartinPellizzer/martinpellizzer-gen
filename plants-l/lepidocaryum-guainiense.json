    "intro": "Lepidocaryum guainiense, commonly known as the Guainiense fern, is a rare and unique species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lepidocaryaceae, a group of ferns characterized by their specialized reproductive structures. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology, with finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lepidocaryum guainiense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
