    "intro": "Lobelia rotundifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rounded, velvety leaves that are narrower than those of the typical lobelia. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its foliage and flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
