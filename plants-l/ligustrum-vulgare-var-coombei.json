It features opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black berries in the autumn. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its adaptability and dense growth habit. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
