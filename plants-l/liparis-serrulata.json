    "intro": "Liparis serrulata, commonly known as the saw-toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically fragrant and bloom in late spring to early summer. Liparis serrulata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
