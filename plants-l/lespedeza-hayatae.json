    "intro": "Lespedeza hayatae, commonly known as Japanese stragglerweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new environments. Lespedeza hayatae is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
