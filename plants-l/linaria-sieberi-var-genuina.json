    "intro": "Linaria sieberi var. genuina, commonly known as the Sieber's toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often arranged oppositely along the stem. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
