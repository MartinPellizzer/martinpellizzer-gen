    "intro": "Leptactina heinsioides, commonly known as the Heinsii fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green and covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
