    "intro": "Lindsaea repens var. lingulata, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with long, creeping rhizomes that root at the nodes. The leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in forest understories."
