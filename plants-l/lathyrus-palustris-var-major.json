    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. major, commonly known as the marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
