    "intro": "Liparis ecallosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Liparis ecallosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
