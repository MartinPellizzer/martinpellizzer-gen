    "intro": "Lobivia pentlandii var. larae, commonly known as the Lara's Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cacti species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features a rounded, ribbed stem with prominent areoles, from which it produces short, woolly spines. The plant typically blooms with bright yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
