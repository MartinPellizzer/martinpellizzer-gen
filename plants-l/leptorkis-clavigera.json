    "intro": "Leptorkis clavigera, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant's unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
