    "intro": "Lamium garganicum var. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth-lipped dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairless or only slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
