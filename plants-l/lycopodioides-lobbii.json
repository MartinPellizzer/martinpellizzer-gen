    "intro": "Lycopodioides lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. Native to the tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant produces spores in sporangia that are clustered in strobili, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Its morphology reflects adaptations to low-light conditions and nutrient-poor soils."
