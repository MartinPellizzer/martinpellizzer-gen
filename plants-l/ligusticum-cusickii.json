    "intro": "Ligusticum cusickii, commonly known as Cusick's lovage, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a distinctive scent when crushed. Its small white to greenish flowers appear in umbrella-shaped clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
