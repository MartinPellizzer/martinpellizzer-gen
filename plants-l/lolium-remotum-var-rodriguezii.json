    "intro": "Lolium remotum var. rodriguezii, commonly known as the Rodrigues ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
