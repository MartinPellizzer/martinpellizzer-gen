It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red berries that contrast with its glossy green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has compound leaves with three leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, making it a plant to be handled with care."
