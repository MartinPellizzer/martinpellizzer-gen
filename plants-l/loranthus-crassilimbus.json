    "intro": "Loranthus crassilimbus, commonly known as the thick-leaved mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems and leaves, which are modified into structures called haustoria. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forests where it forms symbiotic relationships with various tree species. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant's berries are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal."
