    "intro": "Litsea minuta, commonly known as dwarf Chinese tallowtree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
