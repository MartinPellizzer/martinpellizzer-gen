    "intro": "Lotus nubicus var. montanus, commonly known as the alpine lotus, is a rare and hardy plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmate leaves with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
