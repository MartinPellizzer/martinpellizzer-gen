    "intro": "Leptocarpus parkeri, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in maritime environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats. Leptocarpus parkeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
