    "intro": "Lycopus virginicus, commonly known as blueweed or American bugleweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, woodland areas and wetlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Lycopus virginicus is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
