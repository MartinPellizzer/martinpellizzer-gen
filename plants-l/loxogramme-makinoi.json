It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette shape, often with intricate, lace-like patterns. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its fronds are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Loxogramme makinoi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
