    "intro": "Limnorchis limosa, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Limnorchis limosa is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
