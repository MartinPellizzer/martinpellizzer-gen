It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
