    "intro": "Lanonia hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan lanonia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with smooth, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
