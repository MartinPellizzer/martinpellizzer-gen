    "intro": "Languas pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep violet. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Languas pyramidata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
