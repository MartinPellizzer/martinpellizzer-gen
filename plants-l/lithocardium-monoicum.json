    "intro": "Lithocardium monoicum, commonly known as the single-flowered lithocardium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific arid regions. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes many desert plants, and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems. The plant produces a single, showy flower that typically blooms in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its adaptation to extreme environments involves thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lithocardium monoicum is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
