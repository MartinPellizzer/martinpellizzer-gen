    "intro": "Leucadendron racemosum, commonly known as the silver tree, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and cone-like inflorescences that appear in late winter. The plant belongs to the Proteaceae family and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The silver tree is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
