    "intro": "Limonium carolinianum var. compactum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its salt tolerance makes it an important species for stabilizing coastal ecosystems. The showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
