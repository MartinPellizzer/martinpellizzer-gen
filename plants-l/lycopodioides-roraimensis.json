    "intro": "Lycopodioides roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil, thriving in the unique high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments of these isolated table mountains. The plant exhibits a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, scale-like leaves that are typically clustered around its erect, branching stems. It plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in protecting such rare botanical treasures."
