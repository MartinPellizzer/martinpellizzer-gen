    "intro": "Logania neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leaf logania, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that contrast beautifully with its clusters of bright orange-red flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
