    "intro": "Lygisma inflexum, commonly known as the bent-leaved lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a distinctive greenish-gray coloration. The plant consists of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on rocks, soil, or tree bark in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
