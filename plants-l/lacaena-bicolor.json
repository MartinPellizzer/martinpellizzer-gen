    "intro": "Lacaena bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique combination of fungal and algal components. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive coloration, which typically includes a mix of white, yellow, and orange hues. The thallus of Lacaena bicolor is crustose, forming a thin, flat layer on its substrate, often found on bark or stone. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is relatively rare and found in specific ecological niches."
