    "intro": "Lobivia acchaensis, commonly known as the Peruvian rock rose, is a species of cactus native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lobivia acchaensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
