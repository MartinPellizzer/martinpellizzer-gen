    "intro": "Lamium molle, commonly known as soft deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are softly hairy and have a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lamium molle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
