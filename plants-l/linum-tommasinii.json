    "intro": "Linum tommasinii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Linum tommasinii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and rocky areas."
