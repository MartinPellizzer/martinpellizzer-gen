    "intro": "Linaria munbyana var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf toadflax, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, slender stems and produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Its compact growth habit and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
