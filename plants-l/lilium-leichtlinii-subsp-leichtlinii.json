    "intro": "Lilium leichtlinii subsp. leichtlinii, commonly known as the Leichtlin's lily, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with prominent red spots on the outer tepals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are grass-like, arranged in a fan shape, and it produces a single, tall stem bearing the showy bloom. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
