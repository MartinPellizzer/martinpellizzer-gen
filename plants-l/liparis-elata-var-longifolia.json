    "intro": "Liparis elata var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of greenish-yellow flowers with slender petals. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires a humid environment to flourish. It is often found in swampy regions and along the edges of ponds or streams. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
