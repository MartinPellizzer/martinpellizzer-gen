    "intro": "Larix dahurica f. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited larch, is a variant of the Dahurian larch, characterized by its distinctive red or orange-brown cones that persist on the branches throughout the winter. It is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including parts of China and the Russian Far East. The plant typically grows in cold, dry climates and is adapted to high altitudes and rocky soils. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding, contributing to its ornamental value. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its unique cone color and hardy nature."
