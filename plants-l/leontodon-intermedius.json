    "intro": "Leontodon intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate leopard's-bane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the daisy family (Asteraceae) and typically grows in grassy areas and open woodlands. The plant features basal leaves that are narrowly lance-shaped and a flowering head with yellow disc florets surrounded by white ray florets. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a showy appearance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
