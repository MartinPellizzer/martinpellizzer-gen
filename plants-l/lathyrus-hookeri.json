    "intro": "Lathyrus hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lathyrus hookeri is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
