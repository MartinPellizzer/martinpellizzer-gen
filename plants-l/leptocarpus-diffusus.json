    "intro": "Leptocarpus diffusus, commonly known as the broadleaf sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by water. Leptocarpus diffusus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often found in brackish or saline environments."
