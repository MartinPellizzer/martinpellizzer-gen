    "intro": "Limonium oleifolium subsp. pseudodictyocladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea lavender, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in coastal areas and saline soils. It is well adapted to coastal environments due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging conditions."
