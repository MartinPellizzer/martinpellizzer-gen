    "intro": "Ledermanniella variabilis, commonly known as the variable ledermanniella, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its morphology exhibits significant variability, which has led to confusion in its taxonomic classification. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
