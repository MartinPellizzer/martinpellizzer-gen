    "intro": "Lolium coelorachis, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Lolium coelorachis is sometimes used in forage production but can also become a weed in agricultural settings."
