    "intro": "Leptandra, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with finely toothed margins, and its small, red berries are produced in autumn. Leptandra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
