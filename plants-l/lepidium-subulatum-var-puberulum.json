    "intro": "Lepidium subulatum var. puberulum, commonly known as the slender cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It has small, needle-like leaves that are densely covered with fine, short hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas, thriving in moist, temperate climates."
