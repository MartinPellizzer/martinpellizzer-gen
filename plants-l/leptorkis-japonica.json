    "intro": "Leptorkis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Leptorkis japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in partially shaded gardens."
