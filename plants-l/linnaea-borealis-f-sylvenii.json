    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. sylvenii, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, waxy leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a unique ability to form dense mats. This form is distinguished by its smaller size and more subdued floral display compared to the typical Linnaea borealis."
