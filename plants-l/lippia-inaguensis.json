    "intro": "Lippia inaguensis, commonly known as the Inagua shrub, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
