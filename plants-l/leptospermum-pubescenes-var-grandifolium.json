    "intro": "[WRONG START] Leptospermum pubescens var. grandifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically 5\u201315 cm long. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. This variety is closely related to the more well-known manna gum, but it is distinguished by its larger leaves and broader growth habit."
