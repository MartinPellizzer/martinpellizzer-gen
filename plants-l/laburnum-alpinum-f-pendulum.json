    "intro": "Laburnum alpinum f. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping laburnum, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its cascading clusters of bright yellow, pendulous flowers. Native to the Alps, it is a compact shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1.5 to 2 meters. The plant features slender, arching branches that support its showy, pea-like blooms, which appear in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The weeping laburnum is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its dramatic, flowing form."
