It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are typically dark brown in color. Lathyrus parviflorus is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
