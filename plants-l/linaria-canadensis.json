    "intro": "Linaria canadensis, commonly known as Canadian toadflax, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and roadside ditches. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Canadian toadflax is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in disturbed soils."
