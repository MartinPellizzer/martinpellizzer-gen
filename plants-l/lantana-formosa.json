    "intro": "Lantana formosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian lantana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common ornamental plant in coastal and tropical gardens. However, it can become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native flora."
