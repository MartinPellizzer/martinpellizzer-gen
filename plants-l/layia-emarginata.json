    "intro": "Layia emarginata, commonly known as the coast layia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as dunes and roadsides. Layia emarginata is adapted to coastal conditions, with a low, sprawling growth habit that helps it withstand wind and salt spray."
