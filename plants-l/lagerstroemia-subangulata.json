    "intro": "Lagerstroemia subangulata, commonly known as the narrow-angled crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has elliptical to lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its attractive peeling bark, which adds visual interest throughout the year."
