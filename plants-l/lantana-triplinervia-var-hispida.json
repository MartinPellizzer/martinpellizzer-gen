    "intro": "Lantana triplinervia var. hispida, commonly known as roughleaf lantana, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, pink, or red, depending on the variety. These flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, making it an important plant in pollinator habitats. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites."
