    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. tenuisulcata, commonly known as the narrow-corrugated twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive, finely serrated edge. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical species, with narrower leaves and a shorter stature. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories."
