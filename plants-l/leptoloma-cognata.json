It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruit, which is composed of fused carpels and resembles a small star when mature. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are clustered in cymes, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
