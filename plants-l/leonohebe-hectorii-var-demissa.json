    "intro": "Leonohebe hectorii var. demissa, commonly known as Hector's leonohebe, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils along the shores of the South Island. It is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species suited to maritime climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
