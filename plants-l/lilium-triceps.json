    "intro": "Lilium triceps, commonly known as the three-lobed lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with three distinct lobes on each petal. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern around the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The bulbs of Lilium triceps are used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental beauty."
