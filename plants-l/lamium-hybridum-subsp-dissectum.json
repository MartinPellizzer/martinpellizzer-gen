    "intro": "Lamium hybridum subsp. dissectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dead-nettle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are finely toothed and often have a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, with two lips, characteristic of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often used in herbal remedies, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
