    "intro": "Lycopodium setaceum subsp. galapagense, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos clubmoss, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae, characterized by its spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls, and it produces sporangia that release spores for reproduction. This subspecies plays a significant role in the unique flora of the Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystem."
