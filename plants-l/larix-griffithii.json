    "intro": "Larix griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's larch, is a species of larch native to the Himalayas. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that produces small, cone-like structures containing seeds. The tree has needle-like leaves that turn yellow in the autumn before falling off, a unique characteristic among conifers. It typically grows in high-altitude regions and is adapted to cold and harsh climates. The bark of Griffith's larch is often thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors."
