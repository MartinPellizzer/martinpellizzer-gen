    "intro": "Lupinus delicatulus, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, clustered purple or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a short life cycle and is often found in coastal regions, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Lupinus delicatulus plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plant species."
