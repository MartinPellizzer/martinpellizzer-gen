    "intro": "Lepanthes abitaguae, commonly known as the Abitagua orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence bears small, colorful blooms. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes abitaguae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
