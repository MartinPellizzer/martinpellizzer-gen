    "intro": "Lasianthus sonlangensis, commonly known as the Son Lang endemic or Son Lang wildflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
