    "intro": "Lathyrus niger, commonly known as black vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a legume characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated, bean-shaped pods containing several seeds. Lathyrus niger is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it useful in soil enrichment and as a cover crop."
