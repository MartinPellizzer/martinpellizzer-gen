    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. symmetricus, commonly known as the symmetric lotus, is a variant of the common bird's-foot trefoil. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, symmetrical petal arrangement. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed and have a unique, almost symmetrical shape that sets it apart from other members of the genus. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
