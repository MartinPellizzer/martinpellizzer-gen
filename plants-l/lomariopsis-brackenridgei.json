    "intro": "Lomariopsis brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rock faces or in shaded crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant threats to its survival."
