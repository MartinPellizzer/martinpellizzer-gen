    "intro": "Linaria macropoda, commonly known as the large-flowered toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange to red-brown flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its slender, branching stems are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually opposite along the stem. Linaria macropoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
