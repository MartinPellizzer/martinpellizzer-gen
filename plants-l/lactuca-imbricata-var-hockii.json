    "intro": "Lactuca imbricata var. hockii, commonly known as Hock's lettuce, is a variant of the species Lactuca imbricata, which is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. This plant is characterized by its rosette formation of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
