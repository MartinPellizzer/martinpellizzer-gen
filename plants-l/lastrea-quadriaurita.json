    "intro": "Lastrea quadriaurita, commonly known as the four-auricle liverwort, is a small, perennial plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct thallus with four auricles, or lobes, that give it its scientific name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure called a thallus that absorbs nutrients directly from the environment. Lastrea quadriaurita plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
