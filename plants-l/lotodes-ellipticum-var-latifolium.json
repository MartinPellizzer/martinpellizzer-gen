    "intro": "Lotodes ellipticum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically a deep green color, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
