    "intro": "Laricorchis loefgrenii, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant typically grows in high-elevation forests and meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence on underground fungal networks. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
