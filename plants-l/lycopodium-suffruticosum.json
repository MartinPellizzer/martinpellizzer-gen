    "intro": "Lycopodium suffruticosum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features whorled leaves and produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear spores. Lycopodium suffruticosum is characterized by its primitive structure, which reflects its position as a primitive vascular plant. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
