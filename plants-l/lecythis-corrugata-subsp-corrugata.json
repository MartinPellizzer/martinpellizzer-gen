    "intro": "Lecythis corrugata subsp. corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated lecythium, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often deeply veined. The plant produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a single large seed, which is encased in a hard, spiny shell. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. The species is valued for its ornamental leaves and has some traditional uses in local communities."
