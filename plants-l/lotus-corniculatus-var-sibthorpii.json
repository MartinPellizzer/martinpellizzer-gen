    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorp's narrow-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and trifoliate, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. This variety is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
