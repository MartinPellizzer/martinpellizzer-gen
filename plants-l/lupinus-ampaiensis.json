    "intro": "Lupinus ampaiensis, commonly known as the Ampai lupine, is a flowering plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus ampaiensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for horticultural purposes."
