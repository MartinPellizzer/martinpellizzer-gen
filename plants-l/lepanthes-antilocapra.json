    "intro": "Lepanthes antilocapra, commonly known as the antelope orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes antilocapra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
