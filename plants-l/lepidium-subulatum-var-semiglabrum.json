It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is distinguished by its relatively smooth, less hairy surface compared to other varieties of Lepidium subulatum."
