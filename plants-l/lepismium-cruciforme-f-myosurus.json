It is characterized by its unique, flattened, ribbed stems that resemble a cross, hence the species name \"cruciforme.\" The foliage consists of small, spiny leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. It produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the cooler months. This plant is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
