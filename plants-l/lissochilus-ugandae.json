    "intro": "Lissochilus ugandae, commonly known as the Uganda orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Uganda. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow blossoms. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
