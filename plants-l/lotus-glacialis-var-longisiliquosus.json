    "intro": "Lotus glacialis var. longisiliquosus, commonly known as the glacier lotus, is a rare alpine plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its frost-resistant foliage and small, delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of fine, silvery hairs. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that remain attached to the plant for an extended period. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions."
