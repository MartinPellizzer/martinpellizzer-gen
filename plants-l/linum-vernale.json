    "intro": "Linum vernale, commonly known as common flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of blue or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous husk, which has been historically used for producing linen and oil. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both agricultural and medicinal purposes."
