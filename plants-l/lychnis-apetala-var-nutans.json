    "intro": "Lychnis apetala var. nutans, commonly known as the drooping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in eastern North America. It features prostrate stems that produce small, white or pink flowers with five petals. The plant has no true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures called phyllodes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
