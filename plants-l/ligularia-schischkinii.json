    "intro": "Ligularia schischkinii, commonly known as the Schischkin's ligularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a clustered inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with proper moisture and light conditions."
