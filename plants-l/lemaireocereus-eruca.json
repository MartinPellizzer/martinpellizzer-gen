    "intro": "Lemaireocereus eruca, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that bear clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers during the winter months. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, white flowers that are often fragrant. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
