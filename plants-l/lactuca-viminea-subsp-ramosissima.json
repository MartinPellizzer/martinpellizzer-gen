    "intro": "Lactuca viminea subsp. ramosissima, commonly known as the curly endive, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and dark green, slightly curly leaves that are often used in salads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and mild taste, it is appreciated both in culinary and ornamental gardening."
