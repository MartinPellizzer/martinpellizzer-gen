    "intro": "Lysimachia glauca, commonly known as golden creeping-jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
