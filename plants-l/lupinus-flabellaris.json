    "intro": "Lupinus flabellaris, commonly known as the flabellate lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and showy, clustered purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Lupinus flabellaris is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in its native range."
