    "intro": "Lindsaea rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often tinged with red or reddish hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and typically grows on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, moss-like layer that helps retain moisture. Lindsaea rubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
