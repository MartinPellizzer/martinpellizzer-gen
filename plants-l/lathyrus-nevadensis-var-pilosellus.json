    "intro": "Lathyrus nevadensis var. pilosellus, commonly known as the Sierra grass vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to rocky soils. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and mountain slopes, and is often found in areas with well-drained soil. This variety is distinguished by its soft, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance among other Lathyrus species."
