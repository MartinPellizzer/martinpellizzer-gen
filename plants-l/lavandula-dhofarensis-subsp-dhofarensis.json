    "intro": "Lavandula dhofarensis subsp. dhofarensis, commonly known as the Dhofar lavender, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal areas of Oman. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, silver-gray leaves and spikes of pale violet to lilac flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas, where it is exposed to strong winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
