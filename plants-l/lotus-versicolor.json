    "intro": "Lotus versicolor, commonly known as the variable lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps repel water and support the plant's buoyancy."
