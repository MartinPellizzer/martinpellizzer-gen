    "intro": "Lomaria spicant var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated lomaria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in elongated spikes during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
