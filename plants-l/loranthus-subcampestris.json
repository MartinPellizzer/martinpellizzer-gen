    "intro": "Loranthus subcampestris, commonly known as the field mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. This species is found in various parts of Europe and is often associated with open woodlands and hedgerows."
