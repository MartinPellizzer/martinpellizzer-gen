    "intro": "Lecanopteris crustacea, commonly known as the crusty polypody, is a fern species characterized by its unique, leathery, and often crinkled fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Lecanopteris crustacea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
