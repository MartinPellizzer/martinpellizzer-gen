    "intro": "Lathyrus tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Lathyrus tenuifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
