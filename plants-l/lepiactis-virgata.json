    "intro": "Lepiactis virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Lepiactis virgata is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
