    "intro": "Leucaena retusa, commonly known as the silky leucaena, is a perennial leguminous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually hairy and have a soft, silky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for forage and soil improvement. Leucaena retusa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility."
