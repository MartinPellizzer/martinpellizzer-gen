    "intro": "Lupinus eriocladus, commonly known as the soft-leaved lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant features soft, hairy leaves that distinguish it from other lupine species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus eriocladus is a valuable plant for pollinators and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
