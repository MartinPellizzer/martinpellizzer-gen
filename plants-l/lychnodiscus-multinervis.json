    "intro": "Lychnodiscus multinervis, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to produce offsets, making it easy to propagate."
