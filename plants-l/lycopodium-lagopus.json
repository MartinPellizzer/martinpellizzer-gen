    "intro": "Lycopodium lagopus, commonly known as the ground pine, is a species of clubmoss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Lycopodium lagopus is often found in rocky or forested areas, contributing to soil stabilization. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
