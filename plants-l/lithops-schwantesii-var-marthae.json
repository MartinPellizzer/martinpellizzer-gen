    "intro": "Lithops schwantesii var. marthae, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that help it store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its unique morphology allows it to blend in with its surroundings, providing camouflage from herbivores. It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
