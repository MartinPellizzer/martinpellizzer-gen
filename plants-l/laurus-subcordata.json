    "intro": "Laurus subcordata, commonly known as Turkish laurel or Mediterranean laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used as ornamental features. Laurus subcordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
