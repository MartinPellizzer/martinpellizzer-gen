    "intro": "Lotus australis var. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal lotus, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. Its root system is adapted to tolerate brackish water and sandy soils, making it resilient to coastal conditions. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and hardy nature."
