    "intro": "Liparis nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast with its greenish-yellow petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Liparis nigrescens is a perennial herb that produces small, clustered inflorescences during the wet season."
