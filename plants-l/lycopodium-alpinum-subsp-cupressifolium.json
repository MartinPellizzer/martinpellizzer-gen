    "intro": "Lycopodium alpinum subsp. cupressifolium, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. It features needle-like leaves that are arranged in dense, scale-like clusters, giving it a resemblance to cypress foliage. This subspecies is native to mountainous regions in Europe and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems."
