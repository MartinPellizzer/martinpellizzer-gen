    "intro": "Lupinus pinetorum, commonly known as the pine lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in open coniferous forests and along forest edges, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems with clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in association with pine trees. Lupinus pinetorum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
