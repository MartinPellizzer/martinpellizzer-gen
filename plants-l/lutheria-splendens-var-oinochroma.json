    "intro": "Lutheria splendens var. oinochroma, commonly known as the red-leaf lutheria, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, deep red foliage that contrasts beautifully with its variegated leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
