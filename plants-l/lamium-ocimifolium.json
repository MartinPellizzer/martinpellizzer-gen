It features heart-shaped leaves with a silver-green underside and produces clusters of purple or pink flowers. The plant has a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to wildlife gardens."
