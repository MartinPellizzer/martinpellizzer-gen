    "intro": "Lycopodium turbinatum, commonly known as the turbinated clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance, characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. Lycopodium turbinatum produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are often clustered at the tips of its stems. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and its role in ecological systems."
