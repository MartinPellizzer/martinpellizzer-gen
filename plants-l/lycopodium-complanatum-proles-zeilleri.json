    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum proles zeilleri, commonly known as the flat clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and strobilus structures. It is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces spores within its sporophylls, which are arranged in compact cones. It has a low-growing habit and often forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat. This species is valued for its ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity and moisture retention."
