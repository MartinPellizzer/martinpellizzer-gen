    "intro": "Leucopogon deformis, commonly known as the twisted leucopogon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings. Leucopogon deformis is valued for its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and its adaptability to partial shade."
