    "intro": "Larix polonica, commonly known as the Polish larch, is a species of coniferous tree native to eastern Europe. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically dark green and turn golden in the autumn. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Larix polonica is known for its ability to thrive in colder climates and is a valuable component of boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. Its wood is strong and durable, making it useful for construction and other industrial applications."
