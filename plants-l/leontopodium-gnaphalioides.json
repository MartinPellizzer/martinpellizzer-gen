It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow floral heads surrounded by silky, white bracts that resemble a crown. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its frost-resistant properties. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often considered a symbol of resilience and alpine beauty."
