    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. purpureus, commonly known as the purple narrow-leafed lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often purple-tinged foliage and spires of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in ecological restoration projects."
