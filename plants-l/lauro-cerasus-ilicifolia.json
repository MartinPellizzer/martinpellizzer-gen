    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus ilicifolia, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from areas where children or pets are present."
