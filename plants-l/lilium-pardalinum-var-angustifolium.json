    "intro": "Lilium pardalinum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tiger lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers with black spots, which resemble a tiger's stripes. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive harsh conditions. The flowers bloom in mid to late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
