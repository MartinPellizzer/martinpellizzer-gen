    "intro": "Ligaria cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ligaria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, featuring succulent leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ligaria cuneifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
