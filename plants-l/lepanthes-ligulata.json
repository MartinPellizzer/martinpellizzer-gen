It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths.
