    "intro": "Lachnagrostis scabra, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a rough or hairy surface, contributing to its common name. Lachnagrostis scabra is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
