    "intro": "Leontice altaica, commonly known as the high mountain leontice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and sometimes edible species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Leontice altaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
