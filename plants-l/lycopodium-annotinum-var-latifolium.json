    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
