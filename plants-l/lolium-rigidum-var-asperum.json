    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. asperum, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Lolium rigidum var. asperum is also known for its ability to tolerate grazing and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
