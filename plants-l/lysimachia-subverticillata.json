    "intro": "Lysimachia subverticillata, commonly known as false forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm, with slender stems and opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lysimachia subverticillata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can spread by runners, forming dense mats."
