    "intro": "Lucilia acutifolia f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of Lucilia acutifolia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
