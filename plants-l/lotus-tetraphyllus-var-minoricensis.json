    "intro": "Lotus tetraphyllus var. minoricensis, commonly known as the Minorica lotus, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Minorca in the Balearic archipelago. This plant is a perennial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils. The species is notable for its limited distribution and is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental pressures. It plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, supporting local pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
