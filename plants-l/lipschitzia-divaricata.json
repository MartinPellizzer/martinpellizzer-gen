    "intro": "Lipschitzia divaricata, commonly known as the rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Lipschitzia divaricata is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions."
