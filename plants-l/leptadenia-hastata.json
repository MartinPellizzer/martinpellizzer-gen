It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, featuring small, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant contains milky sap, which is toxic and has been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal purposes. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Leptadenia hastata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
