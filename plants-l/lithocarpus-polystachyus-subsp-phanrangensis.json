    "intro": "Lithocarpus polystachyus subsp. phanrangensis, commonly known as the Phanrang ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its hard, dense wood. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, leathery leaves and is known for its long lifespan and slow growth rate. Its fruit is a nut enclosed in a spiny husk, which is an adaptation for seed dispersal by animals. The species is valued for its timber and plays a significant role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
