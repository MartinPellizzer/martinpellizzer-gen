    "intro": "Leucopogon lanceolatus var. gelidus, commonly known as the Antarctic leucopogon, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica. It is a low-growing shrub with small, needle-like leaves adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the short summer season. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a unique ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the Antarctic flora."
