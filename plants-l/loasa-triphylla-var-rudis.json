    "intro": "Loasa triphylla var. rudis, commonly known as the roughleaf loasa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
