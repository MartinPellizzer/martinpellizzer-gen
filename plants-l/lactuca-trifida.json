    "intro": "Lactuca trifida, commonly known as the thistle lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by prickly, spiny seed heads. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are edible but can be bitter, and the plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
