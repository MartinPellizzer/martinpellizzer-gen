    "intro": "Lupinus pendentiflorus, commonly known as the hanging-flower lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its drooping, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple and pink, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several oblong seeds. Lupinus pendentiflorus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities that benefit soil fertility."
