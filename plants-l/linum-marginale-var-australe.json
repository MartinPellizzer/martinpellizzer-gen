    "intro": "Linum marginale var. australe, commonly known as the Australian flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, hairy texture, while the fibrous stems are valued for their historical use in making textiles and ropes. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments."
