    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum var. hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporophytic reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
