    "intro": "Listera dentata, commonly known as the toothed basketflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Listera dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
