    "intro": "Loranthus scortechinii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially damaging."
