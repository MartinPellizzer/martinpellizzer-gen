    "intro": "Lantana zahlbruckneri, commonly known as the Hawaiian lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Lantana zahlbruckneri is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in the Lantana genus, though it is less commonly cultivated outside its native range."
