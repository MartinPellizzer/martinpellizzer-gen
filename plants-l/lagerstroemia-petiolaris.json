    "intro": "Lagerstroemia petiolaris, commonly known as the Chinese flowering maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, producing clusters of pink to red flowers. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive bark, which exfoliates to reveal smooth, mottled surfaces."
