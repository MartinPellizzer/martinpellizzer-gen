    "intro": "Ligustrum simonii, commonly known as Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
