    "intro": "Lupinus breweri, commonly known as Brewer's lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of vibrant blue or purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it typically grows in rocky or arid environments. Lupinus breweri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
