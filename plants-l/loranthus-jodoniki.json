    "intro": "Loranthus jodoniki, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Loranthus jodoniki is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates."
