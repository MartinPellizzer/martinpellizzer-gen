    "intro": "Lilium madeirense, commonly known as the Madeiran lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Madeira. It is a bulbous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems bearing showy, fragrant flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with six petals and a prominent central spur. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of Madeira. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
