    "intro": "Linum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy flax, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny, oval seeds. Linum hirsutum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also related to the flax plant, which is used for fiber and oil production."
