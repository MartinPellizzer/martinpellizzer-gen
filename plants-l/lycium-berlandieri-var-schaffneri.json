    "intro": "Lycium berlandieri var. schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, red or orange berries that are edible when ripe. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are typically small and oval, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
