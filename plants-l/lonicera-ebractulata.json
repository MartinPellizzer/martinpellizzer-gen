    "intro": "Lonicera ebractulata, commonly known as the slender honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming in the spring. Its red berries, which appear in the fall, are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Lonicera ebractulata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade."
