    "intro": "Leptinella altilitoralis, commonly known as the coastal leptinella, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal areas of southern South America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates with mild winters. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value."
