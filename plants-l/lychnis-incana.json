It features hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks.
