    "intro": "Lysimachia longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while the flowers are clustered in umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lysimachia longipedicellata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
