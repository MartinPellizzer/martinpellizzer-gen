    "intro": "Lepanthes metaxy, commonly known as the metaxy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes metaxy is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
