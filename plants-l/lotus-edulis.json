    "intro": "Lotus edulis, commonly known as the water caltrop, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, round fruit that resembles a small, armored nut. The plant's leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Lotus edulis thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
