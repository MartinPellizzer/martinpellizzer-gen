It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries in the fall. Its growth habit is compact, with multiple stems forming a dense, bushy structure. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
