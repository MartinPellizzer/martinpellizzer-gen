    "intro": "Louvelia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of about 15 species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and sometimes red. They typically grow as shrubs or herbs, with opposite leaves and often hairy stems. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature."
