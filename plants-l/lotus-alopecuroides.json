    "intro": "Lotus alopecuroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its flowers are typically pink or purple, blooming in summer. Its roots form a dense network beneath the water, helping to stabilize the sediment. The lotus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in various regions."
