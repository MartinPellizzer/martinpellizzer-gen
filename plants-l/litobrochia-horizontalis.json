    "intro": "Litobrochia horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal brochidium, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that grow horizontally along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the wet season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to harsh desert conditions. Litobrochia horizontalis is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to environments with low rainfall and high temperatures."
