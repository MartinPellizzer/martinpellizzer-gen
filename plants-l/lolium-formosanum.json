    "intro": "Lolium formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
