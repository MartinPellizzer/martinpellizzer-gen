    "intro": "Litsea faberi f. dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf litsea, is a rare botanical variant of the Litsea faberi species. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant is native to specific regions of China, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
