    "intro": "Larnalles dichotoma, commonly known as the split-stemmed lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive dichotomous branching pattern. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, especially in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is composed of a dense layer of fungal hyphae intertwined with algae, which provide the photosynthetic function. Its structure allows it to efficiently absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and substrate. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
