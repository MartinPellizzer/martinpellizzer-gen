    "intro": "Lobelia bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features tubular, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a flowering stem that rises above the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Lobelia bulbosa is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
