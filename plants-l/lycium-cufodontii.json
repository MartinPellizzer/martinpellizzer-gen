    "intro": "Lycium cufodontii, commonly known as the Cufodontii boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments."
