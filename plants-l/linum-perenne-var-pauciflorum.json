    "intro": "Linum perenne var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Due to its low flower count and delicate appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens."
