    "intro": "Lonicera loureiroi, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and can grow up to 30 feet in length. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red and edible, often attracting birds and other wildlife. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
