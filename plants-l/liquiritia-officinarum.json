It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into pods containing several seeds. Its roots are the primary part used medicinally and commercially, containing the compound glycyrrhizin, which contributes to its sweet taste and various pharmacological properties. Liquorice is also valued in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects."
