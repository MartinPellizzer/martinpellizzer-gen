    "intro": "Lastrea pennigera, commonly known as the rock fig or stone fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to drought conditions."
