    "intro": "Lupinus piperitus, commonly known as the peppered lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, papery pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus piperitus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
