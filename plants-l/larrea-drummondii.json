    "intro": "Larrea drummondii, commonly known as grevillea, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and woody, often spiny stems. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically small and leathery, reducing water loss through transpiration. Larrea drummondii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
