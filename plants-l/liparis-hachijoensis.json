    "intro": "Liparis hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the remote Hachijo Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is known for its resilience in coastal climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
