These plants are characterized by their aromatic, often fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. They are native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. Lucinaea species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The roots of some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
