    "intro": "Lysimachia trientalioides, commonly known as creeping yellowjacket, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective groundcover but also a potential invasive species in some areas."
