    "intro": "Locusta echinata, commonly known as the spiny locusta, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits that contain hard, angular seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and useful in traditional medicine."
