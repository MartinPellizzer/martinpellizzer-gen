    "intro": "Lupinus integrifolius, commonly known as the western tall larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its root system is typically fibrous. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus integrifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
