These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. Loxania species typically thrive in humid, well-drained soil and require bright, indirect light. They are popular houseplants due to their compact size and vibrant blooms. The genus includes several species, such as Loxania hirta and Loxania purpurea, which are prized for their ornamental value."
