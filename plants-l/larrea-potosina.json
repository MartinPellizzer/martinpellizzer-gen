    "intro": "Larrea potosina, commonly known as velvetleaf grevillea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soils. Larrea potosina is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
