    "intro": "Lepisanthes langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
