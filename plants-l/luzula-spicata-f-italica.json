    "intro": "Luzula spicata f. italica, commonly known as the Italian wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with slender, dark green leaves that often have a bluish tint. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
