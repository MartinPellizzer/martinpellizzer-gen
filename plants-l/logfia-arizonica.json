    "intro": "Logfia arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona logfia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Logfia arizonica is considered a species of conservation concern."
