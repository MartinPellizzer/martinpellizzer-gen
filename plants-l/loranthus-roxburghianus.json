    "intro": "Loranthus roxburghianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases sticky seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia."
