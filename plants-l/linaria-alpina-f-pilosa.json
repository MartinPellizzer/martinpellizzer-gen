    "intro": "Linaria alpina f. pilosa, commonly known as the Alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils. Linaria alpina f. pilosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments."
