    "intro": "Lactaria salubris, commonly known as the noble milkcap, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored cap, which often has a slight sheen, and a white, milky substance that exudes when the cap is cut. The stem is typically slender and cylindrical, with a fibrous texture. This mushroom is found in temperate regions, often growing in association with coniferous trees. It is considered edible but should be carefully identified due to its similarity to other species."
