    "intro": "Lupinus huaronensis var. pascoensis, commonly known as the Pasco lupine, is a perennial legume native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the Andes. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role."
