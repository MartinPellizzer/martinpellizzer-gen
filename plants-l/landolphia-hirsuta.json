    "intro": "Landolphia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy landolphia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a climbing shrub that produces large, showy yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant's leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals."
