    "intro": "Lithops karasmontana var. aiaisensis, commonly known as the Aiais Lithops, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the growing season. Its leaves are typically pale green with a slightly darker edge, and it forms compact clusters. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
