    "intro": "Lotus acutus, commonly known as the acute lotus, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in shallow aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, a feature that contributes to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. The flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by insects."
