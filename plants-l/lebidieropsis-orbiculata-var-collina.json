    "intro": "Lebidieropsis orbiculata var. collina, commonly known as the mountain lebidieropsis, is a rare and specialized plant species found in high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, orbicular leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, which is a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
