    "intro": "Lonicera caprifolium f. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered honeysuckle, is a botanical variant of the common honeysuckle. It is characterized by its reduced number of flowers compared to the typical species, which makes it a distinctive and less common form. The plant is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in woodland areas and moist soils. Its small, fragrant flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
