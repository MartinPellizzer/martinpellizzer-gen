It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
