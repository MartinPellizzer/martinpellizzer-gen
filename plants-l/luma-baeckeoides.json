    "intro": "Luma baeckeoides, commonly known as the yellow luma, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its bright yellow blooms. Luma baeckeoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
