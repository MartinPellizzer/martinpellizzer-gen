    "intro": "Lemphoria andraeana, commonly known as the Andraean's lemphoria, is a rare and elusive plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
