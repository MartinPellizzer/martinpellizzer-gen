    "intro": "Leandra opaca, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form clumps over time. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Leandra opaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
