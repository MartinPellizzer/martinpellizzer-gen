    "intro": "Leptodactylon hazeliae, commonly known as the hazel fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can form dense colonies. The fronds are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported astringent properties."
