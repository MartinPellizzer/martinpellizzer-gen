    "intro": "Lepidocupania globosa, commonly known as the globular cup fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soridia on the underside of its leaves. Lepidocupania globosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
