    "intro": "Linaria hexandra, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, elongated seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Linaria hexandra is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
