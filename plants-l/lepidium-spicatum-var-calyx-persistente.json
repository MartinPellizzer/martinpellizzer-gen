    "intro": "Lepidium spicatum var. calyx-persistente, commonly known as the persistent calyx wallflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The variety is distinguished by its persistent calyx, which remains attached to the fruit even after it has matured. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and clusters of yellow or white flowers."
