    "intro": "Lagenocarpus tremulus var. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved trembling fern, is a variant of the trembling fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically arching, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. This variant is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
