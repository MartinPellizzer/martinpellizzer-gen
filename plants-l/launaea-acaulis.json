    "intro": "Launaea acaulis, commonly known as the spiny dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows from 30 to 100 centimeters tall, characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose the fruiting structures. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Launaea acaulis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
