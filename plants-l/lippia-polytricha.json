It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and small, white to light blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are widely used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and digestive properties. Lippia polytricha is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
