    "intro": "Leptoglottis potosina, commonly known as the Potosi grass, is a rare and endangered plant native to the highlands of Bolivia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forest environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
