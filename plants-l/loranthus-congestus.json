    "intro": "Loranthus congestus, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that absorb nutrients from the host. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are often clustered and appear in the axils of the stems. Loranthus congestus produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new host trees."
