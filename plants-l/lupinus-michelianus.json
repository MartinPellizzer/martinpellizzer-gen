    "intro": "Lupinus michelianus, commonly known as the Micheli's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus michelianus is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil for other plant species."
