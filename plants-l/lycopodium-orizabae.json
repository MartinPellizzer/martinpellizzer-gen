    "intro": "Lycopodium orizabae, commonly known as the Orizaba clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a low-growing habit with needle-like leaves that form dense mats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
