    "intro": "Lampayo officinalis, commonly known as the medicinal orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
