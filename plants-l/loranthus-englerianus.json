    "intro": "Loranthus englerianus, commonly known as the Engler's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting bird populations."
