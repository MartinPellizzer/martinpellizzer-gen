    "intro": "Loranthus ocrocarpus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain sticky seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Loranthus ocrocarpus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, and its presence can affect the health of its host trees."
