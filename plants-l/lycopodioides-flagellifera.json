    "intro": "Lycopodioides flagellifera, commonly known as the flagellate clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides flagellifera thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its structure and reproductive methods reflect its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
