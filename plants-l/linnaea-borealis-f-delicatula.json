    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. delicatula, commonly known as the fragrant wintergreen, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique feature is the presence of a fragrant, lemon-scented oil in its leaves, which gives it its common name. This form is distinguished by its more refined leaf structure and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical Linnaea borealis."
