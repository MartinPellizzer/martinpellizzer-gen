    "intro": "Listrostachys odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant wood vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and as a climbing plant. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
