    "intro": "Lycopodium taxifolium var. saururoides, commonly known as the dragon's tail fern, is a species of clubmoss characterized by its distinctive, horizontally spreading rhizomes. It features a dense rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the foliage, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is valued in both horticultural and conservation contexts."
