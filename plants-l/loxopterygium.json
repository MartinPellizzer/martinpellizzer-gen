    "intro": "Loxopterygium, commonly known as the spurge or milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Loxopterygium species are typically shrubs or herbs with simple, alternate leaves and showy, cyathium-like inflorescences. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in dry, disturbed habitats. Some species are used in traditional medicine, though caution is required due to their toxic properties."
