    "intro": "Lacinaria serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering lacinaria, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Lacinaria serotina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract beneficial insects."
