It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Lupinus praestabilis plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
