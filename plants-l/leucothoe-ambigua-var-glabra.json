    "intro": "Leucothoe ambigua var. glabra, commonly known as smooth leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features elliptical, dark green leaves that are smooth and glossy, providing an attractive appearance throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for border plantings or as a specimen plant in shaded areas."
