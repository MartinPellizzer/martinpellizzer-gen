    "intro": "Lycium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow boxwood, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that provides a lush, dark green appearance. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Lycium umbrosum thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
