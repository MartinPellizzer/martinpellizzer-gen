    "intro": "Logfia minima, commonly known as the dwarf logfia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
