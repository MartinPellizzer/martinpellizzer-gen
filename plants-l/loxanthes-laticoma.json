    "intro": "Loxanthes laticoma, commonly known as the broad-leaved loxanthes, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Loxanthes laticoma is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
