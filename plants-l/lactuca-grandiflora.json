    "intro": "Lactuca grandiflora, commonly known as the giant lettuce or broad-leaved lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, spiky seed heads. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Lactuca grandiflora is not typically cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
