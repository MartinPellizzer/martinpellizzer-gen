    "intro": "Lobelia boninensis f. viridis, commonly known as the green lobelia, is a rare variant of the lobelia species native to the Bonin Islands. This plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are a vibrant green, distinguishing it from other forms of the species. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
