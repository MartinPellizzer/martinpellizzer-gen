    "intro": "Lycopodium dichotomum var. pusillum, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive branching pattern, with dichotomous stems that split into two equal parts at each node. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem. This variety is closely related to other lycopodians and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for microorganisms."
