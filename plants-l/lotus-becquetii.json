    "intro": "Lotus becquetii, commonly known as the African lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its rhizomes grow underwater, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. Lotus becquetii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
