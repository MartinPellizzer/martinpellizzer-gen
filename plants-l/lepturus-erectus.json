It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
