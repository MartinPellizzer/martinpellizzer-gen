    "intro": "Lappula arida subsp. cusickii, commonly known as the desert lappula, is a low-growing, annual herb native to arid regions of North America. It typically features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by bead-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of arid environments."
