    "intro": "Leptodermis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy skin vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Leptodermis pilosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
