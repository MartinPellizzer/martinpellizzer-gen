    "intro": "Lepanthes rhynchion, commonly known as the narrow-lobed violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with three sepals and three petals, with the lip being distinctly notched. Lepanthes rhynchion thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the orchid family and its ornamental value in horticulture."
