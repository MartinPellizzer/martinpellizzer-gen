    "intro": "Leucorchis lucida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like appearance and its elongated, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly forms. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Leucorchis lucida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
