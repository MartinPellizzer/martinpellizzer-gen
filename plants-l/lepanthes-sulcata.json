    "intro": "Lepanthes sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with a distinctive zigzag pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it relies on epiphytic growth on trees. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help it conserve water in its natural habitat. Lepanthes sulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
