    "intro": "Lupinus larsonianus, commonly known as the Larsson's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus larsonianus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
