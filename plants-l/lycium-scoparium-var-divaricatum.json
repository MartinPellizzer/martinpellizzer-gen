    "intro": "Lycium scoparium var. divaricatum, commonly known as the silverleaf lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
