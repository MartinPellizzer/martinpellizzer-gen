    "intro": "Lacistema nena, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant is climbing and produces vibrant blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The seeds are encased in a fleshy, red berry that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds through animal activity."
