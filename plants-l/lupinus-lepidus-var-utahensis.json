It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Lupinus lepidus var. utahensis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native range."
