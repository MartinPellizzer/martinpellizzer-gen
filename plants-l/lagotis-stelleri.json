    "intro": "Lagotis stelleri, commonly known as the Steller's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from cold temperatures. Lagotis stelleri plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for Arctic ecosystems."
