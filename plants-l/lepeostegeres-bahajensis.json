    "intro": "Lepeostegeres bahajensis, commonly known as the Bahamian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
