    "intro": "Lycopodium cubanum, commonly known as the Cuban clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium cubanum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique structure and reproductive features make it an important species in the study of ancient plant evolution."
