    "intro": "Lonicera alpigena f. semiconnata, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
