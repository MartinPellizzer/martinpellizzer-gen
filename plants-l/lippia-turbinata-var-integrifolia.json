    "intro": "Lippia turbinata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf hawthorn, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically smooth-margined, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a red or orange color. This species is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
