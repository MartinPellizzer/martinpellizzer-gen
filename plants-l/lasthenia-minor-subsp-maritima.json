    "intro": "Lasthenia minor subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal rayless goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local pollinators."
