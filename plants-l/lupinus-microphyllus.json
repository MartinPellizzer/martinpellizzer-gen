    "intro": "Lupinus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves and tall spikes of blue to violet flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are often used as forage for livestock and have been historically used by Indigenous peoples for food and ceremonial purposes. Lupinus microphyllus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
