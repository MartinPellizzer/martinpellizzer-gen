    "intro": "Lomaria elongata var. cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's lomaria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
