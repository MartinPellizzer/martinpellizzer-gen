    "intro": "Leucaena diversifolia subsp. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are alternate and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in agroforestry systems for its nitrogen-fixing ability. The subspecies stenocarpa is distinguished by its narrower leaflets and more compact growth habit compared to other leucaena species."
