    "intro": "Lyperia tortuosa, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in early spring. Lyperia tortuosa is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
