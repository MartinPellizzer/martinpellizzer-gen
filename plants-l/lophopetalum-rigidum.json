    "intro": "Lophopetalum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like red or orange flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lophopetalum rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant floral displays."
