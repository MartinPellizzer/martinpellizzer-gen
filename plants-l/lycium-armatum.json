    "intro": "Lycium armatum, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow-orange berries that are edible when ripe. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white. The berries are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
