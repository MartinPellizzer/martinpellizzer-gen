    "intro": "Leucheria abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf leucheria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes and bloom in the spring. Leucheria abbreviata is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species, making it a characteristic component of rich, mesic forest understories."
