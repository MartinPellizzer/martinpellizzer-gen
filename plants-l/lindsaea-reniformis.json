    "intro": "Lindsaea reniformis, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often divided into lobes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Lindsaea reniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
