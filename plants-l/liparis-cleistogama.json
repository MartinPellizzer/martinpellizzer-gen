    "intro": "Liparis cleistogama, commonly known as the closed flower orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, often leafless stems and its unique reproductive strategy, producing cleistogamous flowers that remain closed and self-pollinate. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories. Its flowers are small and greenish, lacking the showy petals of many other orchid species. Liparis cleistogama is valued for its ecological role in supporting specific pollinators and its resilience in disturbed environments."
