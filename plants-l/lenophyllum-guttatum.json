    "intro": "Lenophyllum guttatum, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters. The species is known for its carnivorous nature, utilizing its bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrient acquisition."
