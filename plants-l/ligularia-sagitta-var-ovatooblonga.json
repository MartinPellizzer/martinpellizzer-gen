It features heart-shaped, ovate-oblong leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland gardens. Its foliage and floral display make it a popular choice for ornamental planting in damp, partially shaded areas."
