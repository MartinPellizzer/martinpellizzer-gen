    "intro": "Lithocarpus indutus, commonly known as the glossy ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree belonging to the Fagaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically glossy on the upper surface and pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, woody nuts enclosed in a cupule, which is a unique feature of the genus Lithocarpus. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its dense wood and slow growth, it is valued for timber and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
