    "intro": "Lactuca integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth leaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, elongated leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Lactuca integrifolia is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter taste."
