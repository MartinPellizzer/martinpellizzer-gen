It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a dark green upper surface.
