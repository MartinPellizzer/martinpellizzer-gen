    "intro": "Leptorkis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that typically grows on rocks and soil in arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its compact, leathery thallus that is often pale green to yellowish in color. The plant lacks distinct leaves and flowers, instead relying on its symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi for nutrition. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a slow growth rate and the ability to survive in low-nutrient environments. Due to its small size and cryptic appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental health."
