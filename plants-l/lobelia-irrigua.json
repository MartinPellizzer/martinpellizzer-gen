    "intro": "Lobelia irrigua, commonly known as the water lobelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 3 feet tall. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lobelia irrigua is adapted to moist soils and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various pollinators."
