    "intro": "Lupinus breviscapus, commonly known as the short-capped lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus breviscapus plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
