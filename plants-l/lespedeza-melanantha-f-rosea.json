    "intro": "Lespedeza melanantha f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, rose-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
