    "intro": "Lespedeza sessiliflora, commonly known as narrowleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its trifoliate leaves are opposite and have a distinctive, narrow shape. Lespedeza sessiliflora is often used in erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
