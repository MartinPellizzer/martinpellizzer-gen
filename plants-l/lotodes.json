    "intro": "Lotodes, commonly known as water lily, is a aquatic plant that belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water or pond beds. Its leaves are usually round or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and yellow, and are often used in ornamental ponds and water gardens."
