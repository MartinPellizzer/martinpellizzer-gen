    "intro": "Leucanthemum cacuminis, commonly known as the alpine oxeye, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its white ray florets and yellow disc florets, forming a daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is a perennial herb that produces small, showy flowers from late spring to early summer. Leucanthemum cacuminis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
