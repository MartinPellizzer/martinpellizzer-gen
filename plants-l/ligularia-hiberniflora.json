    "intro": "Ligularia hiberniflora, commonly known as the winter-flowering ligularia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply veined and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, making it a unique addition to shady gardens. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
