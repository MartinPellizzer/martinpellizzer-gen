    "intro": "Leptostylis multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered leptostylis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Leptostylis multiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils."
