It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow-orange fruits resembling small apples. The fruit's pulp is rich in nutrients, including vitamins and minerals, making it a valuable crop in traditional Andean agriculture. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the cool, humid climates of the Andes."
