    "intro": "Lithocardium mezianum, commonly known as the mountain rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in a dense, mat-like structure, which helps it survive in harsh, rocky environments. Lithocardium mezianum is well adapted to poor soils and extreme weather conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
