    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 brownii var. fuchsioides, commonly known as the red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its showy floral display. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
