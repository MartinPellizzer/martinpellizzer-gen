It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid produces showy, pendulous blooms that can remain open for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
