    "intro": "Leucas helianthemifolia, commonly known as the coastal helianthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is often found growing on rocky soils and coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun."
