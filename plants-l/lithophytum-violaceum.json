    "intro": "Lithophytum violaceum, commonly known as the violet lithophyte, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a lithophyte, meaning it typically grows on rocky surfaces, often in crevices or on cliffs. The plant produces striking violet-colored flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to its arid habitat. It has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Lithophytum violaceum is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-drained soil and minimal water."
