    "intro": "Lagotis crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lagotis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
