    "intro": "Leersia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican leersia, is a perennial grass species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Leersia mexicana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
