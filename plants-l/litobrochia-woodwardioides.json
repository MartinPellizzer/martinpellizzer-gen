    "intro": "Litobrochia woodwardioides, commonly known as the rock brochidium, is a rare and specialized cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines that provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Litobrochia woodwardioides is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
