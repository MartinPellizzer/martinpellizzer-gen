    "intro": "Liparis obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, slender stem and a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in pine flatwoods or wetlands. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
