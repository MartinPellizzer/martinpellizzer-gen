    "intro": "Lepisanthes perviridis, commonly known as the green lepisanthes, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage is thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Lepisanthes perviridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
