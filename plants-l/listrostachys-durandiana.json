    "intro": "Listrostachys durandiana, commonly known as the Kashmiri cherry or Durand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, bright red berries that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is also cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine practices."
