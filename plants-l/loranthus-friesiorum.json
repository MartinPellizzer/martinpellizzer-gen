    "intro": "Loranthus friesiorum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval-shaped leaves and white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its berries are red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees, facilitating its spread. This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by supporting birdlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
