    "intro": "Lolium vulgare, commonly known as ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. Ryegrass is widely used in pastures, lawns, and as a forage crop due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions."
