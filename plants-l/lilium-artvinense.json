    "intro": "Lilium artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the northeastern region of Turkey. It is a bulbous perennial plant characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium artvinense is considered a vulnerable species."
