    "intro": "Loranthus vieillardii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches to its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through haustoria that absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to tropical Africa and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
