It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are often composed of numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
