It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Lyonia stahlii var. stahlii is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats."
