It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a distinctive red or orange tint, especially under strong sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its unique coloration and compact form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
