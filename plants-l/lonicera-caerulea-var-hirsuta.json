    "intro": "Lonicera caerulea var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by birds and humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and hedgerows. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential as a food source."
