    "intro": "Lobivia aurea var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that are often adorned with a pale yellow or greenish hue. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Its leaves are typically short and cylindrical, adapted to store water in its native environment. This variety is prized for its unique, twisted growth form and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
