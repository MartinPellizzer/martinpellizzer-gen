    "intro": "Lamprotis mucronata, commonly known as the slender tailed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
