    "intro": "Lithophragma bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous rockjelly, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, bulb-like stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the summer months. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Lithophragma bulbiferum is often found growing in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
