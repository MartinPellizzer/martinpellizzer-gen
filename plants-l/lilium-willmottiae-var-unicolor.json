    "intro": "Lilium willmottiae var. unicolor, commonly known as the single-colored fritillary, is a rare and striking species of lily native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display a single, intense color, often a deep red or orange, without the usual contrasting markings found in other fritillaries. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems that bear the striking blooms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
