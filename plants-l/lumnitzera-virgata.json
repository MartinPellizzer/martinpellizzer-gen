    "intro": "Lumnitzera virgata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and estuarine environments. It is native to the Indo-Pacific region and is often found in mangrove forests where it plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. Its small, white flowers are followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are important for local wildlife and human consumption. Lumnitzera virgata contributes to the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing erosion."
