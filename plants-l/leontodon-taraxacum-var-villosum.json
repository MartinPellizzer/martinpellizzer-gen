It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other dandelion varieties. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
