It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, upright stems covered with fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, giving the plant its common name. Lysimachia asperulifolia thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
