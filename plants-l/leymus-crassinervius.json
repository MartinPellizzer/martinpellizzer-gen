    "intro": "Leymus crassinervius, commonly known as the broad-veined wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves with prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along the edges of wetlands. Leymus crassinervius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its flowering heads are usually spike-like and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
