    "intro": "Landolphia glandulosa, commonly known as the African spurred orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with prominent spurred lobes. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Landolphia glandulosa is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
