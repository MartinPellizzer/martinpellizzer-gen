    "intro": "Luma pilotantha, commonly known as the silver tree, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii. It is characterized by its silvery, hairy leaves that reflect sunlight, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in coastal environments make it well adapted to tropical climates. Luma pilotantha is often used in traditional Hawaiian medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic value."
