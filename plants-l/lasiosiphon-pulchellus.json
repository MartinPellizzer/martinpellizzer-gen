    "intro": "Lasiosiphon pulchellus, commonly known as the pretty siphon, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polemoniacaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal and forested areas, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Lasiosiphon pulchellus is an important species for pollinators, particularly native bees and birds, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
