    "intro": "Lysimachia subherbacea, commonly known as the creeping yellow loosestrife, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in terminal cymes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy texture. Lysimachia subherbacea is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
