    "intro": "Lotus eriophorus var. heermannii, commonly known as the Heermann's lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots extending into the substrate. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and water pollution, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
