    "intro": "Lycopodiella riofrioi, commonly known as the Riofr\u00edo clubmoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around a central axis. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate sporophylls, a feature typical of lycophytes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
