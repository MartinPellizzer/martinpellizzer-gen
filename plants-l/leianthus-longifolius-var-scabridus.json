    "intro": "Leianthus longifolius var. scabridus, commonly known as the rough-leaved leianthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
