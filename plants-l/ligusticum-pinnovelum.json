    "intro": "Ligusticum pinnovelum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lovage, is a perennial herb native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that give it its common name. Its flowers are small and yellow-green, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ligusticum pinnovelum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
