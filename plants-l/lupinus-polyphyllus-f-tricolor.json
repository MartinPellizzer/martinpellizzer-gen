This plant features striking tri-colored flowers, typically with purple, white, and yellow petals, which make it visually distinctive. It is a perennial herb that grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces erect, sparsely branched flowering stems. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
