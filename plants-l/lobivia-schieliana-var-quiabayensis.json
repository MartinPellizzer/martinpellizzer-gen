    "intro": "Lobivia schieliana var. quiabayensis, commonly known as the Quiabayensis Lobivia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright green to bluish-green stems that are often adorned with white to pale pink spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
