    "intro": "Leptinella dispersa subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock lewisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
