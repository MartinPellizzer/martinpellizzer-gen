    "intro": "Leptogramma aurita var. levingei, commonly known as the slender leaved fern, is a variant of the leptogramma aurita species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on forest floors or rocky substrates. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped segments that give it a feathery appearance. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
