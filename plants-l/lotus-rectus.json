    "intro": "Lotus rectus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to Asia. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that support the showy, pink or white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are submerged and help stabilize the soil, preventing erosion. The lotus is also known for its symbolic significance in various cultures, representing purity and enlightenment."
