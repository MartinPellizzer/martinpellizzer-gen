    "intro": "Lycium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. The plant has spiny branches and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Lycium cuneatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
