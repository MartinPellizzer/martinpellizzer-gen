    "intro": "Leptolepia dissecta, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Leptolepidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, though this trait is more pronounced in certain cultivars. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical study."
