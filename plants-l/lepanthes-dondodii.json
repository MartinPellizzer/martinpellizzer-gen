    "intro": "Lepanthes dondodii, commonly known as the Dondodi orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Lepanthes dondodii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
