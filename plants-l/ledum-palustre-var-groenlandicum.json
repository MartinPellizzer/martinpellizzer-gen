    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. groenlandicum, commonly known as Greenland Labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, dark green leaves with a waxy coating and emits a strong, minty scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and heathland environments. Due to its slow growth and limited range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
