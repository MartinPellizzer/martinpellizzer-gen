    "intro": "Leptorkis coelogynodes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often growing close to the ground with a rosette-like arrangement of foliage. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
