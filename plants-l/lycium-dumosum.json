It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, and its berries are sometimes cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
