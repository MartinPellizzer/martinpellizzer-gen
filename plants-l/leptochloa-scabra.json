    "intro": "Leptochloa scabra, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Leptochloa scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
