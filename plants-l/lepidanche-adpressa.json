    "intro": "Lepidanche adpressa, commonly known as the flat lepidanche, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or greenish flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
