It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas and along roadsides. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated fields."
