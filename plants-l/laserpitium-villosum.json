It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Laserpitium villosum is often used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
