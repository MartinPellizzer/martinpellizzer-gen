    "intro": "Lussa amarissima, commonly known as the bitter lussa, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a fibrous root system and upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is notable for its bitter-tasting sap, which has been used traditionally in local medicine."
