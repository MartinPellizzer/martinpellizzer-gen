    "intro": "Lagunaria, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, often vibrant flowers that can range in color from white to deep red. They typically have palmately lobed leaves and produce capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Lagunaria species are often found growing near coastal areas, which reflects their adaptation to salty, humid environments."
