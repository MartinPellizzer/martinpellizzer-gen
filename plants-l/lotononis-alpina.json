    "intro": "Lotononis alpina, commonly known as the alpine lotononis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Lotononis alpina is adapted to harsh alpine environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
