    "intro": "Lindsaea mannii, commonly known as the silver lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, silver-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, forming compact clumps with narrow, leathery leaves. Lindsaea mannii produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
