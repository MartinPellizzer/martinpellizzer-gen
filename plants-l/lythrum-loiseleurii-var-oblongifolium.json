    "intro": "Lythrum loiseleurii var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf lythrum, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features striking spikes of deep purple to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often broader than those of the typical lythrum species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and native plant landscapes."
