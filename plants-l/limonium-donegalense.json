    "intro": "Limonium donegalense, commonly known as the Donegal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Ireland. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads that resemble small holly berries. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and coastal environments. It produces small, green, egg-shaped bracts that surround the flower cluster, giving it a unique appearance. Limonium donegalense is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
