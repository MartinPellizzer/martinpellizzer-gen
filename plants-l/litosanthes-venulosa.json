    "intro": "Litosanthes venulosa, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant produces slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, blue to violet flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Litosanthes venulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
