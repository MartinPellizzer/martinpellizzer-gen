    "intro": "Loranthus amplexifolius, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as mango and tamarind. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which contain one or two seeds, are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit. This parasitic relationship can weaken the host tree over time, making it an ecologically significant but sometimes problematic species."
