    "intro": "Lespedeza medicaginoides, commonly known as narrowleaf lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. Narrowleaf lespedeza is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control."
