    "intro": "Ligusticum integrifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved lovage, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features aromatic, serrated leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes and roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum integrifolium thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
