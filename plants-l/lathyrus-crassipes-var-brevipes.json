It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands and along rocky slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
