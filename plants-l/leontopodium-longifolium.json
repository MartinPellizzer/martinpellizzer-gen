    "intro": "Leontopodium longifolium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high altitudes where the climate is cool and the soil is rocky and well-drained. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and beauty in harsh environments. Due to its limited range and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is also considered a protected species in many areas."
