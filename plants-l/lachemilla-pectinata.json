    "intro": "Lachemilla pectinata, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
