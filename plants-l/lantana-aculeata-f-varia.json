    "intro": "Lantana aculeata f. varia, commonly known as the variegated lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation."
