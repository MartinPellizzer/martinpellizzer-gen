    "intro": "Licania arachnites, commonly known as the spider lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Licania arachnites plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
