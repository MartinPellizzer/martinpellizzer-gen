    "intro": "Luzula unalaschkensis, commonly known as the Alaskan woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils in tundra and alpine environments. The plant features dense,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white to pale yellow flowers. Luzula unalaschkensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
