    "intro": "Liparis siamensis, commonly known as the Siam orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insects."
