    "intro": "Lepidium montanum var. tenellum, commonly known as the mountain cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed or open environments at higher elevations."
