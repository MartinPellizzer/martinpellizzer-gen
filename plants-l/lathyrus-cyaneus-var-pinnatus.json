    "intro": "Lathyrus cyaneus var. pinnatus, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems with compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikes of small, delicate flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
