    "intro": "Lonicera nummulariifolia subsp. nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its distinctive oval, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs. It produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology compared to other Lonicera species."
