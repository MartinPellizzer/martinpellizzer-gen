    "intro": "Lussacia pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf lussacia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
