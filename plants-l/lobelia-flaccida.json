    "intro": "Lobelia flaccida, commonly known as the drooping lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in spikes at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lobelia flaccida is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
