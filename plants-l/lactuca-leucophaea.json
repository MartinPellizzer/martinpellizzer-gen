    "intro": "Lactuca leucophaea, commonly known as white lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and is also used in some traditional medicinal practices. However, it is less common in modern horticulture compared to other lettuce species."
