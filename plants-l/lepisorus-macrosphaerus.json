    "intro": "Lepisorus macrosphaerus, commonly known as the large-sphere fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus macrosphaerus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
