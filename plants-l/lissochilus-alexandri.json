    "intro": "Lissochilus alexandri, commonly known as the Alexander's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often hairy pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive shape resembling a slipper. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
