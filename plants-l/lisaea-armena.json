    "intro": "Lisaea armena, commonly known as Armenian moss or Armenian liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a simple yet delicate morphology, with small, overlapping leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Lisaea armena plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
