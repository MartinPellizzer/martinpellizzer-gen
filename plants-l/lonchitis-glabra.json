    "intro": "Lonchitis glabra, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes near the water's surface. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies, though Lonchitis glabra primarily traps small aquatic organisms using its bladder-like structures. This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms."
