    "intro": "Lunathyrium conilii var. oldhamii, commonly known as the Oldham's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, silver-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the shorelines, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its striking blue or purple flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens."
