    "intro": "Lychnis armoraria, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and features erect, branched stems covered in small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often succulent, adapted to thrive in dry, sandy or rocky soils. Lychnis armoraria is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly areas."
