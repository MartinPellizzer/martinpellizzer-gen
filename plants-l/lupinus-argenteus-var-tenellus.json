It is characterized by its silvery-blue flowers and narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, dark seeds. Lupinus argenteus var. tenellus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
