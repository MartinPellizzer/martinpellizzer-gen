    "intro": "Lettsomia bona-nox, commonly known as the night-blessed lettuce, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it produces small, yellowish composite flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
