    "intro": "Lepigonum rubrum var. radicans, commonly known as creeping fireweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped, slightly hairy, and have a distinctive reddish tinge when mature. This hardy species thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
