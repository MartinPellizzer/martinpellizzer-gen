It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes are usually short and stout, with sporangia clustered in dense formations. This variety is notable for its morphological distinctiveness and ecological importance in its native habitat."
