    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius subsp. reticulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves with a distinctive reticulate (net-like) venation pattern. The plant produces upright spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
