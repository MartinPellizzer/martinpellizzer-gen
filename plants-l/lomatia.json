    "intro": "Lomatia, commonly known as the mountain devil, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, native to Australia. These shrubs are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Lomatia species are typically found in heathland and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens. Some species are also known for their toxic properties, particularly their seed pods, which contain irritants."
