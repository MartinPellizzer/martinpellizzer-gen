    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. sempervirens, commonly known as evergreen privet, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, providing year-round foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, drupaceous berries. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to form thick hedges. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plant species."
