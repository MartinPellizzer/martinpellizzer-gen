    "intro": "Landolphia watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's lion's mouth, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic, and its leaves are often heart-shaped with a rough texture. Landolphia watsonii is often found in moist, open woodlands and can grow up to several meters in height. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
