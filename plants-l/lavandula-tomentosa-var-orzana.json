    "intro": "Lavandula tomentosa var. orzana, commonly known as the Orzana lavender, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage covered in dense, soft pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to lavender flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and mild, sweet fragrance."
