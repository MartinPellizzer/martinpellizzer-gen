    "intro": "Licuala kamarudinii, commonly known as the Kamarudin's palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits that are consumed by various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
