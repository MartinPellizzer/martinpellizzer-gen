    "intro": "Limnorchis leucostachys subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in peat bogs and fen environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
