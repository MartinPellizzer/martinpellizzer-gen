It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a distinctive variegation pattern of white or yellow markings. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
