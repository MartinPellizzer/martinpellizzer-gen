    "intro": "Lomaria eburnea, commonly known as the white lomaria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lomaria eburnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
