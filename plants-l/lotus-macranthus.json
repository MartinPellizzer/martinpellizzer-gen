It features large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, with a distinctively shaped, broad leaf. The plant thrives in shallow water and has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically rounded and floating, while its stems are long and flexible. The lotus is known for its ability to produce oxygen through photosynthesis, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
