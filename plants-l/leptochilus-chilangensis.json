    "intro": "Leptochilus chilangensis, commonly known as the Chilean leathery fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
