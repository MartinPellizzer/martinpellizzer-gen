    "intro": "Lirianthe sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak lily, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, white spatulate leaves and a single, showy inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, black berries that contain the seeds. Due to habitat loss, Lirianthe sarawakensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
