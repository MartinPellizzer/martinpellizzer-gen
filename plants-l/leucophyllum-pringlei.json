    "intro": "Leucophyllum pringlei, commonly known as the Texas lantern plant, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps it conserve water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The flowers attract pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological value."
