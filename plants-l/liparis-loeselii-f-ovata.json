    "intro": "Liparis loeselii f. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its striking, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose spike of flowers, each with three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals being larger and more showy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
