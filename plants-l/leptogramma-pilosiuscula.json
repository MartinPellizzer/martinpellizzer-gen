It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
