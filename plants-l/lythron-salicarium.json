    "intro": "Lythron salicarium, commonly known as the water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged or only partially emerged, with small, arrow-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing tiny, greenish-white blooms that are often overlooked. The plant is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that aid in buoyancy and gas exchange."
