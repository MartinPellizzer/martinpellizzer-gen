    "intro": "Limonia winterlia, commonly known as the winter lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in winter, providing a striking contrast to its glossy, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. Limonia winterlia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic landscaping."
