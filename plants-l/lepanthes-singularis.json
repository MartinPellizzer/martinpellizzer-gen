    "intro": "Lepanthes singularis, commonly known as the singular orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display vivid colors such as red, yellow, or orange. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Lepanthes singularis has lance-shaped leaves and produces flowers in clusters, often during the rainy season. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
