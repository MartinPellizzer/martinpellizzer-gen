    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. caboverdeanum, commonly known as the Cape Verde clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense clusters of scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is native to the Cape Verde Islands and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat."
