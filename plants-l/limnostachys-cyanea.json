    "intro": "Limnostachys cyanea, commonly known as the blue-flowered water plant, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as sedges. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Limnostachys cyanea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
