    "intro": "Lepidium steinbachii, commonly known as the mountain peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind. Lepidium steinbachii is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
