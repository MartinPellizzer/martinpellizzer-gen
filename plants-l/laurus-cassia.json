    "intro": "Laurus cassia, commonly known as Chinese cinnamon or cassia, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by winged fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a strong, spicy scent. Laurus cassia is closely related to the cinnamon tree (Cinnamomum) but is distinguished by its unique bark and leaf characteristics."
