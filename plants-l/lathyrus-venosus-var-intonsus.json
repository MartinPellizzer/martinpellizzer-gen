    "intro": "Lathyrus venosus var. intonsus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with a distinctive venation pattern, and its pods contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
