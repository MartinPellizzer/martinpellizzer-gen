    "intro": "Lupinus pycnostachys, commonly known as the dense-stemmed lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system forms nitrogen-fixing nodules, contributing to soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
