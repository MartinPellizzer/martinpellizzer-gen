    "intro": "Lactuca cubanguensis, commonly known as the Cuban lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, tropical environments. The plant features upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming a composite head similar to that of a dandelion. Lactuca cubanguensis is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter taste."
