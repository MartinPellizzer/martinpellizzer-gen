It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Lonicera cerasina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
