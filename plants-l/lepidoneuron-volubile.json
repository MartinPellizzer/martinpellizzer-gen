    "intro": "Lepidoneuron volubile, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical vine belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature in the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often found in humid forests and is known for its ability to climb and entangle other vegetation."
