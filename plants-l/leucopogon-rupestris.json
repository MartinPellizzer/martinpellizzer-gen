    "intro": "Leucopogon rupestris, commonly known as the rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Leucopogon rupestris is an important component of coastal vegetation, providing habitat for native wildlife."
