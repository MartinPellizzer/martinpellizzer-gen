It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has a compact habit with finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine down. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to carpet rocky or woodland areas."
