    "intro": "Lisianthius uliginosus var. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments, often found in swampy areas and along riverbanks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
