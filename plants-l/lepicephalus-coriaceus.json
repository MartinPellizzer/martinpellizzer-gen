    "intro": "Lepicephalus coriaceus, commonly known as the tough-skinned orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Its root system is adapted to cling to tree bark, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
