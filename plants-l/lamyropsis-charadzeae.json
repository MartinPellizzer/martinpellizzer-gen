    "intro": "Lamyropsis charadzeae, commonly known as the Georgian violet, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its small, clustered inflorescences attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
