It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. The species is part of the Fabaceae family and is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
