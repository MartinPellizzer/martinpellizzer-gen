It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. It has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
