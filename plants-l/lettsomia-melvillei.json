    "intro": "Lettsomia melvillei, commonly known as the Melville\u2019s lichen, is a rare and unique species of lichen found primarily in New Zealand. It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which is typically crustose or foliose in form. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in specific microhabitats. It is often found on shaded, moist rock surfaces and is sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecological health. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lettsomia melvillei is considered a vulnerable species."
