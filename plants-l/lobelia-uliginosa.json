    "intro": "Lobelia uliginosa, commonly known as swamp lobelia, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear whorled clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lobelia uliginosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in sensitive habitats."
