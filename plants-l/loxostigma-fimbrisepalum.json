    "intro": "Loxostigma fimbrisepalum, commonly known as the fringed-sepal lichen, is a unique member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, crustose thallus that forms a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a pale to dark yellowish-green coloration, often with a slight powdery appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as soredia, are scattered throughout the thallus and aid in asexual propagation. Loxostigma fimbrisepalum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in temperate regions."
