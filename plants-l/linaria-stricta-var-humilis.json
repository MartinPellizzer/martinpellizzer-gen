    "intro": "Linaria stricta var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers resembling those of the common toadflax. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
