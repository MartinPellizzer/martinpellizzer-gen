It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat. Libanothamnus typically blooms in late spring or early summer, adding a subtle floral display to its surroundings."
