    "intro": "Lessertia perennans, commonly known as the evergreen cycad, is a unique plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
