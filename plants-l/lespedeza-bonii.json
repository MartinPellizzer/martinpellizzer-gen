    "intro": "Lespedeza bonii, commonly known as Chinese lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Lespedeza bonii is often used in ornamental gardening and as a ground cover due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
