    "intro": "Leandra cuatrecasasii subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western leandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the cloud forests of western Mexico, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
