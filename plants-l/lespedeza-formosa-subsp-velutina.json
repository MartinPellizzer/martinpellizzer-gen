    "intro": "Lespedeza formosa subsp. velutina, commonly known as velvet lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods and disturbed sites. Velvet lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
