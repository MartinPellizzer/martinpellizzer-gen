    "intro": "Lampsana verrucosa, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its fleshy, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Lampsana verrucosa is a carnivorous plant that plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations."
