It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, grassy habitats and has a rosette of basal leaves. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of other dandelions, but it differs in its growth form and geographical distribution. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited range."
