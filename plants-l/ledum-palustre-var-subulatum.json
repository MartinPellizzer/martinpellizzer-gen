    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. subulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features dark green, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and heathlands. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ericaceae family and is known for its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties."
