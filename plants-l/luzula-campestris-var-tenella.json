    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf woodrush, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like clusters with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white flowers, which are usually clustered near the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, and is often found in moist soil conditions. Its botanical structure is adapted for survival in cool, humid climates, making it a characteristic component of montane and subalpine ecosystems."
