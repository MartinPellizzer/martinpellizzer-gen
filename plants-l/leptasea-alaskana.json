    "intro": "Leptasea alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska lewisia, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leptasea alaskana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
