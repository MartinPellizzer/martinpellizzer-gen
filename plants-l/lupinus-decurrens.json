    "intro": "Lupinus decurrens, commonly known as the creeping lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus decurrens is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility in its native habitats."
