    "intro": "Ligularia thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive yellowish-white margin, and it produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in forested areas. It is valued in horticulture for its striking foliage and ability to add vibrant color to shaded gardens. However, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat due to its specific environmental requirements."
