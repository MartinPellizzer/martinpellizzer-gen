    "intro": "Lupinus nanus var. albus, commonly known as the white dwarf lupine, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
