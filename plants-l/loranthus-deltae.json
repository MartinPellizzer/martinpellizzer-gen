    "intro": "Loranthus deltae, commonly known as the delta mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Loranthus deltae is native to Australia and is an important component of the region's ecological systems."
