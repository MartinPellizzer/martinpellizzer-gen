    "intro": "Lidbeckia quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed lidbeckia, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Lidbeckia quinqueloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
