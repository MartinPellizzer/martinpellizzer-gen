    "intro": "Lilium polyphyllum var. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered fritillary, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear a single, large, showy flower with intricate, overlapping petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
