    "intro": "Lussacia incana, commonly known as the silverleaf lussacia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Lussacia incana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
