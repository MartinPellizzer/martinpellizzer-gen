    "intro": "Lonicera trichosantha var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate honeysuckle, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of East Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, velvety texture. Small, fragrant flowers appear in clusters, typically yellow or orange, and bloom in the spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded or moist environments."
