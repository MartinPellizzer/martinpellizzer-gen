    "intro": "Lithocardium rotatum, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, spiky appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Lithocardium rotatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
