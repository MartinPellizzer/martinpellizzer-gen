    "intro": "Linum marginatum, commonly known as the Persian consolida, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and typically have a slightly hairy texture. Linum marginatum thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitats."
