    "intro": "Leonurus occidentalis, commonly known as western hedgehog. It is a flowering plant native to the western United States, characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
