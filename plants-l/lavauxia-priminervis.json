    "intro": "Lavauxia priminervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Native to regions of southern Europe and North Africa, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to dry, sun-exposed habitats."
