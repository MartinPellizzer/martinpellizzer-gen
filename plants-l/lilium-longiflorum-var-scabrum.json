    "intro": "Lilium longiflorum var. scabrum, commonly known as the rough-leaved lily, is a variant of the Easter lily characterized by its textured, often scabrous foliage. It produces showy, white, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically fragrant and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are usually broader and more rugged compared to the standard variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
