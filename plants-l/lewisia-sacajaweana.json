    "intro": "Lewisia sacajaweana, commonly known as the Sierra glacial lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its fleshy, blue-green leaves are covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss. Lewisia sacajaweana is a member of the Montiaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
