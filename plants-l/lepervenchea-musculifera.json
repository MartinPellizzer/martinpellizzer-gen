    "intro": "Lepervenchea musculifera, commonly known as the muscle vine, is a climbing plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its unique feature is the presence of specialized muscle-like structures in its stems, which allow it to grip and climb surfaces effectively. This adaptation makes it well-suited for its natural habitat in humid, tropical environments."
