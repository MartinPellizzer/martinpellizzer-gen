    "intro": "Lepanthes marshana, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and marshes. The plant produces delicate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil in its habitat. Lepanthes marshana is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
