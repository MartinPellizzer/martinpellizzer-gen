    "intro": "Lycopodium chamaepeuce, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a compact, low-growing habit with needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It is typically found in forest floors and rocky areas, preferring cool and humid conditions. Lycopodium chamaepeuce is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
