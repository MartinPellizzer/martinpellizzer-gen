    "intro": "Loncomelos secundum, commonly known as the creeping lily or false lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive, spurred lower petal. Its leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
