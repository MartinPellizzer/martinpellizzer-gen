    "intro": "Lepanthes flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its stems are often twisted or zigzagging, giving it its common name. Lepanthes flexuosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
