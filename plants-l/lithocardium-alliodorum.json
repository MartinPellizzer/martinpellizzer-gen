    "intro": "Lithocardium alliodorum, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its habitat. Lithocardium alliodorum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a resilient species capable of surviving in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
