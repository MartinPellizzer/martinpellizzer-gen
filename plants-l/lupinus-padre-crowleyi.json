    "intro": "Lupinus padre-crowleyi, commonly known as the Father Crowley's lupin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep root systems and small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers, which can range from yellow to red, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus padre-crowleyi is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil in its native habitat."
