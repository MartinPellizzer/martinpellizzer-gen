    "intro": "Lithraea crenata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its hardy, woody structure. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Lithraea crenata is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
