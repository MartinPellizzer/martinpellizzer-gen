    "intro": "Lactuca diversifolia, commonly known as the diverseleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that vary in shape and size. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Lactuca diversifolia is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly used in culinary applications compared to other lettuce varieties."
