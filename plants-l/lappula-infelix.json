    "intro": "Lappula infelix, commonly known as the weedy lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Camelotaceae and is characterized by its annual life cycle and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are often mistaken for weeds due to their inconspicuous appearance. Lappula infelix thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is generally considered a minor weed."
