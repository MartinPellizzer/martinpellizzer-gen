    "intro": "Lupinus pondii, commonly known as the pond's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Lupinus pondii is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and has deep roots that help it thrive in poor soil conditions. It plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
