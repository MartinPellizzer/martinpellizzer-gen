    "intro": "Lithocardium diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf lithocardium, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and vary in shape, which contributes to its common name. Lithocardium diversifolium is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along rocky outcrops."
