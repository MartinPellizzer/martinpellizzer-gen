    "intro": "Liberatia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Liberatia thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
