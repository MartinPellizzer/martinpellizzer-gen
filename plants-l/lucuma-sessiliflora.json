It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is oval-shaped with a hard, bumpy exterior and a sweet, custard-like pulp. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soil. The botanical features of Lucuma sessiliflora make it well adapted to its native environment and suitable for cultivation in similar conditions."
