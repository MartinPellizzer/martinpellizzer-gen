    "intro": "Leptopus esquirolii var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy leathery lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, velvety texture and dark green to blackish upper surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. The thallus is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic relationship. Its distinctive hairy appearance is due to the presence of fine, branched structures called rhizines. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
