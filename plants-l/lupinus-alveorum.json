    "intro": "Lupinus alveorum, commonly known as the alveolar lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its seed pods are typically slender and cylindrical. Lupinus alveorum is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
