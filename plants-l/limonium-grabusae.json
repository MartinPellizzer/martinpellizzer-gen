    "intro": "Limonium grabusae, commonly known as the Canary Islands sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limonium grabusae is considered a rare and endangered species."
