It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with dense clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its compact size and vibrant floral display make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
