    "intro": "Lupinus excubitus, commonly known as the night shade lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lupinus excubitus is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is capable of fixing nitrogen through its root nodules. It plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to soil fertility."
