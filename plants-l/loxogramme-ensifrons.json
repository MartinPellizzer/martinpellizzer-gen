    "intro": "Loxogramme ensifrons, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of new growth. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its wetland environment."
