    "intro": "Lathyrus kilimandscharicus var. scioanus, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro vetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
