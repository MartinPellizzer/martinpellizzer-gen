    "intro": "Lygodium circinnatum var. monstruosum, commonly known as the giant climbing fern, is a striking tropical fern characterized by its large, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb using its rhizomes, often reaching heights of several meters. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and dramatic appearance."
