    "intro": "Lolium strictum subsp. humile, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
