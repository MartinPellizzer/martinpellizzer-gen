    "intro": "Loranthus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Sapotaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces greenish-white flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in forested areas."
