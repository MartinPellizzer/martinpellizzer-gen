    "intro": "Lupinus lacus-huntingtonii, commonly known as Huntington's lake lupine, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
