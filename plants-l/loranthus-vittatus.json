    "intro": "Loranthus vittatus, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood or Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the family Fabaceae, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture. Loranthus vittatus is native to regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia, and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
