It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus colombiensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life in its habitat."
