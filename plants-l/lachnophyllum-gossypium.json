    "intro": "Lachnophyllum gossypium, commonly known as cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces fluffy, white seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common trait among members of its family. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Lachnophyllum gossypium is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert conditions."
