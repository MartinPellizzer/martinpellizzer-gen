    "intro": "Lithospermum maritimum, commonly known as coastal lithosperm, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The roots of Lithospermum maritimum contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
