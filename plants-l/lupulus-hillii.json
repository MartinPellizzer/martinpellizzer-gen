    "intro": "Lupulus hillii, commonly known as the Hill's hops, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its fibrous, rhizomatous root system and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which develop into dry, three-lobed fruits. Lupulus hillii is notable for its use in traditional medicine, where its leaves and roots are employed for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Its cultivation is limited due to its specific ecological requirements and the challenges of its natural habitat."
