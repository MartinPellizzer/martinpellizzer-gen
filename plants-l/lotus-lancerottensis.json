    "intro": "Lotus lancerottensis, commonly known as the Lancerottense lotus, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Lancerot in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it resilient to drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
