It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, purple flowers and has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture. Its seeds contain a unique oil rich in erucic acid, which has been studied for industrial and potential medicinal uses. Lesquerella purpurea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils."
