    "intro": "Lycopodium adpressum f. polyclavatum, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, cylindrical formations called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or rocky crevices. This fern-like plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
