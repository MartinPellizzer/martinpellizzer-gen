    "intro": "Lupinus venturianus, commonly known as the Venturian lupine, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and scrublands. The plant produces tall, spindly stems with clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Lupinus venturianus is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life in its ecosystem."
