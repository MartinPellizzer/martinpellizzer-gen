    "intro": "Limeum viscosum var. hispidulum, commonly known as the sticky lime or velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
