    "intro": "Lactuca debilis, commonly known as slender lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers that attract various pollinators. Lactuca debilis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
