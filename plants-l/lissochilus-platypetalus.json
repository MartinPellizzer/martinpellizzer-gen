    "intro": "Lissochilus platypetalus, commonly known as the broad-petaled lissochilus, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, broad petals and a compact, often hairy inflorescence. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale to dark purple, with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species within the orchid family."
