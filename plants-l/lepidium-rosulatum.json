    "intro": "Lepidium rosulatum, commonly known as the rosette cress, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a small, herbaceous species that forms dense rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Lepidium rosulatum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
