It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its vigorous growth habit and ornamental value make it a versatile plant for landscaping and wildflower gardens."
