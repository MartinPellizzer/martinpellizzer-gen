    "intro": "Lotus cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' lotus, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has palmately compound leaves and produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its harsh mountainous habitat, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
