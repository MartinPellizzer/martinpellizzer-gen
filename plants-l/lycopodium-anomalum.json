    "intro": "Lycopodium anomalum, commonly known as the narrowleaf clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporophylls that bear spores instead of seeds. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its structure includes a stem with whorls of leaves and a root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Lycopodium anomalum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
