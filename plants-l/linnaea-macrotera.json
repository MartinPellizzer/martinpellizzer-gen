    "intro": "Linnaea macrotera, commonly known as the broad-leafed twinflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, oval berries that are edible but not particularly nutritious. Linnaea macrotera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
