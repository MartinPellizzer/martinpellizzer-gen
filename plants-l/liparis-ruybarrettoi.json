    "intro": "Liparis ruybarrettoi, commonly known as the Ruybarretto's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil, while its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the substrate. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
