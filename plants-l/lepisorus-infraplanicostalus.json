    "intro": "Lepisorus infraplanicostalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
