    "intro": "Leuenbergeria marcanoi, commonly known as the Marcanoi's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers with a vibrant mix of purple and yellow hues. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its botanical features include a slender, upright stem and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
