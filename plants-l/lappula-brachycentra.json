    "intro": "Lappula brachycentra, commonly known as the narrowleaf lappula, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. The leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a hairy texture that helps in reducing water loss."
