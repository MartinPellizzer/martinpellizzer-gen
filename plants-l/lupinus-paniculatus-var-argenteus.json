    "intro": "Lupinus paniculatus var. argenteus, commonly known as silver lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and tall, branching inflorescences of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects. The variety argenteus is distinguished by its distinctive silver leaf coloration, which sets it apart from other lupine species."
