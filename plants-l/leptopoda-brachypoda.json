    "intro": "Leptopoda brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed fern, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit. It typically features small, delicate fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to substrates with its rhizomes. Its leaves are usually divided into narrow, linear segments, contributing to its overall feathery appearance. Leptopoda brachypoda plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
