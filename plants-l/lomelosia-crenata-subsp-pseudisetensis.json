    "intro": "Lomelosia crenata subsp. pseudisetensis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
