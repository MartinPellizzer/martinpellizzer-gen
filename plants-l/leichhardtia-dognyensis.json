    "intro": "Leichhardtia dognyensis, commonly known as the Dugum rockheath, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or clay-rich soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Leichhardtia dognyensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
