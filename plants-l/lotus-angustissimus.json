    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus, commonly known as the narrowleaf water-lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Lotus angustissimus is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
