It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths, heathers, and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Leucopogon striatus is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
