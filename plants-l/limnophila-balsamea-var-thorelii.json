    "intro": "Limnophila balsamea var. thorelii, commonly known as the Thorelian water willow, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This variant is distinguished by its subtle differences in leaf morphology and flowering patterns compared to the typical form of Limnophila balsamea."
