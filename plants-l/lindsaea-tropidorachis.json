    "intro": "Lindsaea tropidorachis, commonly known as the tropical lindsaea, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched fronds that often form dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle. Lindsaea tropidorachis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
