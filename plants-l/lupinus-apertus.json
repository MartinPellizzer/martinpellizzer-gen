    "intro": "Lupinus apertus, commonly known as the open lupine, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of spiny, papery pods. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its striking blue to purple flowers. Lupinus apertus has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It is also a popular species for ornamental gardening because of its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
