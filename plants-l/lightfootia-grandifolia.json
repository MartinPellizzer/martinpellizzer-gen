    "intro": "Lightfootia grandifolia, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has a stout, buttressed trunk and broad, palmately lobed leaves that provide shade. Its rapid growth rate makes it suitable for ornamental landscaping, though it can become invasive in some regions. The fruit is a woody capsule containing several winged seeds that are dispersed by wind."
