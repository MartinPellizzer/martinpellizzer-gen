    "intro": "Loranthus fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees, facilitating its spread. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful."
