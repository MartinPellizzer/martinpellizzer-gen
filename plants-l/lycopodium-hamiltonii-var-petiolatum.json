    "intro": "Lycopodium hamiltonii var. petiolatum, commonly known as the petiolate clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures containing sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its petiolate (having a stalk) leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Lycopodium hamiltonii."
