    "intro": "Leucasia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon tree or the Ceylon ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, leathery fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
