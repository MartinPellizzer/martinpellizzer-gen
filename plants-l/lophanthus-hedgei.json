    "intro": "Lophanthus hedgei, commonly known as the Hawaiian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the summer months. Lophanthus hedgei is adapted to grow in coastal and dry forest habitats, often on rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a keystone species in its native ecosystem."
