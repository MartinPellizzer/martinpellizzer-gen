    "intro": "Leptolobium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved leptolobium, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in dry, temperate climates. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with slender, woody stems. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
