    "intro": "Liquidambar barbata, commonly known as the barbata sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Aceraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruit clusters that are encased in a spiky, star-shaped husk. Its flowers are inconspicuous and appear in clusters, while its sap is milky and used in traditional medicine. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
