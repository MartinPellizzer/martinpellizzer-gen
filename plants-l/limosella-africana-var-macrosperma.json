    "intro": "Limosella africana var. macrosperma, commonly known as the African sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dunes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
