    "intro": "Lophopappus, commonly known as the pappus-bearing sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. The most distinctive feature of Lophopappus species is their pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal of seeds. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Lophopappus species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
