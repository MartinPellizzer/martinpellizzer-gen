    "intro": "Lomagramma sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Lomagramma sinuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
