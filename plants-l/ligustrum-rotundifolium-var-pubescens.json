    "intro": "Ligustrum rotundifolium var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent privet, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. The varietal form, pubescens, distinguishes it from other ligustrum species by its hairy foliage."
