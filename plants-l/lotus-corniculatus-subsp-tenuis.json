    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the slender bird's-foot trefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and its yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
