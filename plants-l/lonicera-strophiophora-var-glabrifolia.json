    "intro": "Lonicera strophiophora var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are generally hairless or only sparsely hairy, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, typically yellow or white, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
