    "intro": "Lindera thomsonii var. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's cinnamon fern, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
