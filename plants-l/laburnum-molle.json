    "intro": "Laburnum molle, commonly known as the weeping laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has feathery, compound leaves that turn a striking coppery red in the autumn. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release tufted seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Laburnum molle is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
