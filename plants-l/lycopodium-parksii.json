    "intro": "Lycopodium parksii, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and a rosette-like arrangement of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its sporophytic structure consists of a short, thick stem and a cluster of fertile strobili at the base. Lycopodium parksii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
