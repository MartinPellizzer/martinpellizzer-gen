    "intro": "Linaria pedunculata subsp. lutea, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
