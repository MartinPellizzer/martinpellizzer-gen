    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. brachystachyum, commonly known as the European privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by black, spherical berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
