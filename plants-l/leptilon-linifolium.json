    "intro": "Leptilon linifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved leptilon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
