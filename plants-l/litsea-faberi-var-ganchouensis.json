    "intro": "Litsea faberi var. ganchouensis, commonly known as the Ganchou lithocarp, is a variant of the Litsea faberi species native to China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by hard, nut-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
