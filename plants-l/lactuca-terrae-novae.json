    "intro": "Lactuca terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfangled Lettuce, is a rare species native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland. It is characterized by its crisp, pale green leaves with a slightly bitter taste, similar to other lettuces in the Lactuca genus. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small, yellow, and inconspicuous, appearing in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
