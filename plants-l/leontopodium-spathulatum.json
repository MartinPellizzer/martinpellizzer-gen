    "intro": "Leontopodium spathulatum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its unique morphology is an adaptation to harsh mountain environments, including strong winds and intense sunlight. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions."
