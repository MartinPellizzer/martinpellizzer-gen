    "intro": "Loranthus cultarum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy structure with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus cultarum plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
