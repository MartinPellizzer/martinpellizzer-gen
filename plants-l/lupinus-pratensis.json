    "intro": "Lupinus pratensis, commonly known as the meadow lupine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Lupinus pratensis is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
