It features wiry, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments."
