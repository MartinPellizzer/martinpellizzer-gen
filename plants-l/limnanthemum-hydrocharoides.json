    "intro": "Limnanthemum hydrocharoides, commonly known as water starwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Its leaves are small, floating or submerged, and its stems are flexible, allowing it to adapt to fluctuating water levels. Limnanthemum hydrocharoides plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish."
