    "intro": "Lagothamnus, commonly known as the everlasting or mountain thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These shrubs are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their small, aromatic leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. They typically grow in rocky or dry soils and are well adapted to arid environments. Lagothamnus species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems."
