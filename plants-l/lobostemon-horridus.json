    "intro": "Lobostemon horridus, commonly known as the rough lobostemon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
