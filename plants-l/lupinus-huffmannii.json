    "intro": "Lupinus huffmannii, commonly known as the Huffmann's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus huffmannii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
