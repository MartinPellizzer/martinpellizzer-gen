    "intro": "Leymus angustiformis, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Leymus angustiformis is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-nutrient environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
