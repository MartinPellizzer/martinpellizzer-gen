    "intro": "Ledothamnus guyanensis var. minor, commonly known as the Guyana dwarf thornbush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and thorny stems, which provide structural support and defense against herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, thriving in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its smaller size and more compact growth habit."
