    "intro": "Lathyrus filiformis subsp. ensifolius, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with narrow, linear leaflets that give it a grass-like appearance. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
