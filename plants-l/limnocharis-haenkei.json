    "intro": "Limnocharis haenkei, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a dense, buoyant mat on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, followed by spiny, pear-shaped fruits. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective colonizer of still or slow-moving water bodies. However, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
