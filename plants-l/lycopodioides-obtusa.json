    "intro": "Lycopodioides obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides obtusa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
