    "intro": "Lilium armenum, commonly known as the Armenian lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and a bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The Armenian lily is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in its native regions."
