    "intro": "Lepisorus gueintzii, commonly known as the Gueintz's hartungia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and leathery in texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Lepisorus gueintzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
