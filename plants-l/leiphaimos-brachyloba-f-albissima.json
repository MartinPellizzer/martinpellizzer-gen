    "intro": "Leiphaimos brachyloba f. albissima, commonly known as the white-flowered leiphaimos, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its striking white blooms. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features compact, bushy growth with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are borne in dense clusters and emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
