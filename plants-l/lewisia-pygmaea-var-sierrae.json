    "intro": "Lewisia pygmaea var. sierrae, commonly known as Sierra dwarf Lewisia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It features dense clusters of bright pink to magenta flowers that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to rocky slopes and meadows. The plant has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white to grayish powdery coating, known as a bloom. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
