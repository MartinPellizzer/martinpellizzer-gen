    "intro": "Ledum serpyllifolium, commonly known as mountain tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, including essential oils, which contribute to its medicinal and historical uses. Ledum serpyllifolium thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats."
