    "intro": "Linaria subbaetica, commonly known as the Baetican toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Linaria subbaetica is typically found in rocky soils and open habitats, making it a resilient species adapted to Mediterranean climates."
