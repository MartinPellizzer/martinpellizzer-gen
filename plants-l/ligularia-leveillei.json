It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green coloration. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
