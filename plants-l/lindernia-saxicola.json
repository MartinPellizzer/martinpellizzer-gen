    "intro": "Lindernia saxicola, commonly known as the rock lindernia, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
