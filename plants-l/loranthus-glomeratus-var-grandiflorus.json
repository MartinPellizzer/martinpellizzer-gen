    "intro": "Loranthus glomeratus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or yellowish berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found on native trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
