    "intro": "Lindsaea monosora, commonly known as the single-stem lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that form a dense, rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on air moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Lindsaea monosora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
