    "intro": "Leiotelis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, hairy seeds when mature. Leiotelis is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
