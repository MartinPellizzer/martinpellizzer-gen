    "intro": "Leucopogon obovatus subsp. revolutus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf leucopogon, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant features narrow, obovate leaves that are revolute at the margins, giving it its subspecific name. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are typically pink or reddish in color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
