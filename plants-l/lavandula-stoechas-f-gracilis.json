    "intro": "Lavandula stoechas f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender spike lavender, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage and distinctive, violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Lavandula stoechas. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild lavender scent, though it is less commonly cultivated than other lavender varieties."
