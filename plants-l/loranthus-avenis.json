    "intro": "Loranthus avenis, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves and white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and other animals that disperse its seeds. Despite its parasitic nature, Loranthus avenis is an important component of forest ecosystems."
