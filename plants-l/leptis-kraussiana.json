    "intro": "Leptis kraussiana, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, papery, violet-blue bracts that resemble petals, though it does not produce true flowers. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it to retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in spring. Leptis kraussiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal areas."
