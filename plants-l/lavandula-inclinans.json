    "intro": "Lavandula inclinans, commonly known as the leaning lavender, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the western Mediterranean region, particularly Spain and Portugal, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its upright, woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces spikes of purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in aromatherapy and perfumery."
