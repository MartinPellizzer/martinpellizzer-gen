    "intro": "Leucochloron bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Bolivia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain water in the humid, misty conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
