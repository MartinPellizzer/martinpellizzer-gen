    "intro": "Luzula multiflora var. calabra, commonly known as the Calabrian wood rush, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
