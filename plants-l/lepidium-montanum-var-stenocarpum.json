    "intro": "Lepidium montanum var. stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-carpel peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and narrow, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often covered in fine hairs. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments."
