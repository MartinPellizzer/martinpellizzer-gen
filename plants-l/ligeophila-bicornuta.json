    "intro": "Ligeophila bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
