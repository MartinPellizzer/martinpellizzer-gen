It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
