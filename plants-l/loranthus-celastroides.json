    "intro": "Loranthus celastroides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are typically red or black, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the fur of animals. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host trees if left unchecked."
