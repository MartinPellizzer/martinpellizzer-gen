    "intro": "Lysimachia knuthiana, commonly known as the Knuth's chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features small, opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
