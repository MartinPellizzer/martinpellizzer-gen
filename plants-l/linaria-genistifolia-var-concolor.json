    "intro": "Linaria genistifolia var. concolor, commonly known as the narrowleaf toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
