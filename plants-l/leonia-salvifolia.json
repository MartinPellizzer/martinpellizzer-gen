    "intro": "Leonia salvifolia, commonly known as the fragrant leaf plant, is a tropical species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a subtle citrus scent when touched. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial shade for optimal growth."
