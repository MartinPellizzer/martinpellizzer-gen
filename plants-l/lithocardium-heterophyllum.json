    "intro": "Lithocardium heterophyllum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Lithocardium heterophyllum thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
