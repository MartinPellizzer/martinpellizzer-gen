    "intro": "Lotus gracilis, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, elongated leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, narrow stems that extend into the water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their medicinal properties in traditional medicine. Lotus gracilis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a common sight in ponds and wetlands."
