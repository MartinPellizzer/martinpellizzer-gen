    "intro": "Lucinaea reticulata, commonly known as the netleaf greenbriar, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with a distinctive net-veined pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring. Its berries, which are typically red or black, are edible but often have a bitter taste. Lucinaea reticulata thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
