    "intro": "Leea hirta, commonly known as the hairy leaf vine, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Leea hirta is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
