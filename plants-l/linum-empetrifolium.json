    "intro": "Linum empetrifolium, commonly known as the rock linseed or stone flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky, arid, or coastal environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Linum empetrifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
