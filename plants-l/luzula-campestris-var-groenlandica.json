It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil. Its botanical features reflect its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
