    "intro": "Lilium nanum var. flavidum, commonly known as the yellow dwarf lily, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201315 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is valued for its delicate appearance and hardiness. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
