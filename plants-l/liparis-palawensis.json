    "intro": "Liparis palawensis, commonly known as the Palau orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the island of Palau in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow or white blooms with intricate petal structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or near streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis palawensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
