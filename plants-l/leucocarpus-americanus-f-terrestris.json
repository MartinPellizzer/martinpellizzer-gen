It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically a deep green color with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, spiky fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded areas."
