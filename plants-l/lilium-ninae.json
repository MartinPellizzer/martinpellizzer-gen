    "intro": "Lilium ninae, commonly known as the Nina's lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its elegant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium ninae is considered a vulnerable species."
