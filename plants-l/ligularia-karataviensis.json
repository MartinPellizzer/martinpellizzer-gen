    "intro": "Ligularia karataviensis, commonly known as the Karatav Valley ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a terminal inflorescence, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Asteraceae family."
