    "intro": "Leucopogon thymifolius, commonly known as the thyme-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in coastal heathlands and open woodlands. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are aromatic, with a scent similar to thyme, and are covered in fine hairs. Leucopogon thymifolius is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
