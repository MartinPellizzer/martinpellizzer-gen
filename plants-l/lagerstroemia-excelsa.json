It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that display vibrant red, pink, or orange hues during the flowering season. The plant has smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, elongated fruits. Lagerstroemia excelsa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, tropical climates."
