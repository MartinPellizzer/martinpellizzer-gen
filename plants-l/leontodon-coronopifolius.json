    "intro": "Leontodon coronopifolius, commonly known as the crown-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, calcareous grasslands and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves, with a flowering stem that bears a single, bell-shaped flower with purple to pink petals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Leontodon coronopifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and blooms."
