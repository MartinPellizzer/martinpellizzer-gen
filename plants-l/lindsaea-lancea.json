    "intro": "Lindsaea lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf maidenhair fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Lindsaea lancea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
