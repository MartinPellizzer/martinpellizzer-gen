    "intro": "Lobadium fetidum, commonly known as stinking lobelia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lobadium fetidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
