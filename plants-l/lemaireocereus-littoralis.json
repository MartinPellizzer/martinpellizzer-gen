    "intro": "Lemaireocereus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal night bloomer, is a cactus native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, spiny plant that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are covered in areoles, which are characteristic features of cacti and serve as sites for spines and flowers. The species is adapted to withstand salt spray and high winds, making it well-suited to its coastal habitat."
