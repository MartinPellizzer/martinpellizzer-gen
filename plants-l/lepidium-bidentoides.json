    "intro": "Lepidium bidentoides, commonly known as two-toothed cress, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, streambanks, and roadside areas. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters, and the plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lepidium bidentoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
