    "intro": "Leandra refracta, commonly known as the rock sheath vine, is a climbing plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in woodland areas. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it well adapted to its natural habitat. Leandra refracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
