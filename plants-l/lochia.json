    "intro": "Lochia, commonly known as postpartum vaginal discharge, is a fluid that exits the body after childbirth. It consists of blood, mucus, and tissue from the lining of the uterus. The composition of lochia changes over time, starting as bright red and gradually becoming pinkish, then brownish, and finally yellowish. This process typically lasts for several weeks, aiding in the healing of the uterus. Botanically, lochia is not a plant but a physiological phenomenon related to human reproduction."
