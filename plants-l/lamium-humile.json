    "intro": "Lamium humile, commonly known as narrowleaf deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture and produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. Lamium humile is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to suppress weeds in shaded areas."
