    "intro": "Lycopersicon hirsutum var. glabratum, commonly known as the wild tomato, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fruits resembling small tomatoes, though they are usually less fleshy and more acidic than cultivated varieties. Its botanical features make it an important ancestor in the domestication of modern tomatoes. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils."
