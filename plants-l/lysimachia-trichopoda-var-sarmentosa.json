    "intro": "Lysimachia trichopoda var. sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping yellowmaids, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers clustered in terminal cymes during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs. It is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
