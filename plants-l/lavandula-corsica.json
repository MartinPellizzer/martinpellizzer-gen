It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces spikes of fragrant purple or pink flowers during the summer months, which are rich in essential oils. Its botanical characteristics include small, tubular flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it is closely related to other lavender species.
