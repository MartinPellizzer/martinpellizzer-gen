    "intro": "Liabum amplexans, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant has a spreading growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its small, blue to purple flowers appear in umbrella-shaped clusters, and the leaves are typically heart-shaped with a distinctive basal rosette. Liabum amplexans is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
