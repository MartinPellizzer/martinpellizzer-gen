    "intro": "Limnanthemum geminatum var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in southern Europe. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along the edges of ponds and ditches. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
