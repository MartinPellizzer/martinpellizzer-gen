    "intro": "Lycopodium proliferum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branching stems. The plant has a unique life cycle that includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, typical of bryophytes. Its leaves are small and scale-like, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Lycopodium proliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
