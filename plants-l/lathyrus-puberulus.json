    "intro": "Lathyrus puberulus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its pods contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. Lathyrus puberulus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
