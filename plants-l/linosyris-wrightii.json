    "intro": "Linosyris wrightii, commonly known as Wright's linosyris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Linosyris wrightii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to the harsh conditions of its native range."
