    "intro": "Lavandula tenuisecta f. subaequidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lavender, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive, upright appearance. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to lilac flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny conditions due to its drought tolerance. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both garden use and horticultural collections."
