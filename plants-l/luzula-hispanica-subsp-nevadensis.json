    "intro": "Luzula hispanica subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-brown flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in high-altitude conditions with cool temperatures and moderate precipitation. The subspecies is often found in meadows and rocky slopes, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
