    "intro": "Lupinus cachupatensis, commonly known as the Cachupatensis lupine, is a species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of spiky, violet to blue flowers. The plant features compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its roots are equipped with nitrogen-fixing nodules, contributing to soil fertility. Lupinus cachupatensis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
