    "intro": "Lapathum thyrsoideum, commonly known as the upright hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence at the top of the stem. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It has a distinctive scent reminiscent of carrots and parsley, which can be released when the leaves are crushed. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to handle without proper protection."
