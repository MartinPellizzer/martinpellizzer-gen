    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. desvauxianum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often bright green and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its sporophylls, which bear the spores, are clustered in cones at the tips of the stems. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
