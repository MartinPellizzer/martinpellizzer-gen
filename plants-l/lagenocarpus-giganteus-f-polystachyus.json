    "intro": "Lagenocarpus giganteus f. polystachyus, commonly known as the giant sago palm, is a variant of the sago palm characterized by its large, feather-like leaves. It is a cycad-like plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in panicles, and its seed cones are woody and contain edible seeds. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of starch. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a valuable but rare plant in horticulture."
