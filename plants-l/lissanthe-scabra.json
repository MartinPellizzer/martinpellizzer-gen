    "intro": "Lissanthe scabra, commonly known as the rough lissanthe, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the species name \"scabra,\" and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Lissanthe scabra is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique biome in South Africa."
