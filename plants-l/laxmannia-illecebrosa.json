    "intro": "Laxmannia illecebrosa, commonly known as the sweetroot or wild parsnip, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its root system is notable for containing volatile oils that have been historically used in traditional medicine. L. illecebrosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
