It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Lycopodioides substipitata is an ancient lineage of vascular plants, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
