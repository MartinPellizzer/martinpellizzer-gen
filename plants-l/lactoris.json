    "intro": "Lactoris, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, colorful flowers. Lactoris species are native to various regions, including North America, Africa, and parts of Asia. They play an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on them as a food source for their larvae."
