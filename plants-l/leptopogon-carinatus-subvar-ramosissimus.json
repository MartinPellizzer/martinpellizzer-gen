    "intro": "Leptopogon carinatus subvar. ramosissimus, commonly known as the hairy spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry foliage that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, with the lower glumes being longer than the upper ones. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its more branched inflorescence compared to the typical form."
