    "intro": "Lesquerella arctica var. purshii, commonly known as Arctic lesquerella, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh Arctic conditions. Its seeds contain high levels of erucic acid, making it a subject of interest for both ecological and industrial research."
