    "intro": "Limnia washingtoniana, commonly known as the Washington's limnia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in certain regions."
