    "intro": "Lonicera cerviculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often appearing in clusters. These flowers give way to red berries that are an important food source for birds. Lonicera cerviculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
