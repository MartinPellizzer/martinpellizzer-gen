    "intro": "Larix laricina subsp. alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaska larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the boreal forests of Alaska and northern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and its needle-like leaves, which turn golden yellow in the fall before dropping. The tree produces small, woody cones that release seeds in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is often used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and ecological importance."
