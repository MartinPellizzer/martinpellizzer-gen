    "intro": "Lygodium volubile var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy climbing fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are typically clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. This variety is distinguished by its hairy texture on the fronds, which provides a unique visual feature."
