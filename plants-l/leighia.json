These plants are characterized by their delicate, pendulous flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, pink, and white. Leighia species typically grow on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Their roots are specialized for anchoring and absorbing nutrients, while their leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery). The genus includes several species, with Leighia aurantiaca being one of the most well-known for its striking orange flowers."
