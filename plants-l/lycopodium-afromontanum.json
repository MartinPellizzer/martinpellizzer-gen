It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Lycopodium afromontanum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
