    "intro": "Leptogastrodia wuyishanensis, commonly known as the Wuyi mountain gastrodia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Wuyishan region in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique underground tuberous structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowering period occurs in late spring, producing small, greenish-white flowers that are not showy but are important for its ecological role. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
