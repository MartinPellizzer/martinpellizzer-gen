    "intro": "Lindmania, commonly known as the \"silk cotton tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their large, showy flowers. Lindmania species typically have palmate leaves and produce fluffy, cotton-like seed pods that aid in wind dispersal. They are often found in humid, lowland forests and are valued for their ornamental beauty. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and as sources of fiber."
