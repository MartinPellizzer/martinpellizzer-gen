    "intro": "Lobivia schieliana var. albescens, commonly known as the White-Flowered Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with prominent, ribbed structures that help it store water. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and adaptability to dry environments."
