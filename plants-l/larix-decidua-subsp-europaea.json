It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn, and its cones that mature in the second year. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture. The species plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
