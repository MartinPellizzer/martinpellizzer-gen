    "intro": "Luzula parviflora var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
