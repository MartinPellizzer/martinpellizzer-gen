    "intro": "Lastrea strigilosa, commonly known as the woolly lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in succulents. Lastrea strigilosa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
