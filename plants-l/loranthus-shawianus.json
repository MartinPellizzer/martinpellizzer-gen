    "intro": "Loranthus shawianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees. Loranthus shawianus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments."
