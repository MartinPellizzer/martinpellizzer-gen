It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered pink or red flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds."
