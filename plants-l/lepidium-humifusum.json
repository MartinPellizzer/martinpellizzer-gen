    "intro": "Lepidium humifusum, commonly known as the common peppergrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, pale green leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that split open to release the seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in waste areas. Lepidium humifusum is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various insects."
