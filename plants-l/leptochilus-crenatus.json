    "intro": "Leptochilus crenatus, commonly known as the wavy-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often wavy or undulating in appearance, which is reflected in its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often found in riparian zones. Leptochilus crenatus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
