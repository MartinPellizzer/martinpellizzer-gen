    "intro": "Liabum floribundum, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
