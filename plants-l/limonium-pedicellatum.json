    "intro": "Limonium pedicellatum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Limonium pedicellatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
