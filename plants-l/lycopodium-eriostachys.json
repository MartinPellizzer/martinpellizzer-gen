    "intro": "Lycopodium eriostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium eriostachys is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
