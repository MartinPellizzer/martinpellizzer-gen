    "intro": "Lepidaploa yunquensis, commonly known as the Yunquensis Lepidaploa, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cooler temperatures. Its botanical features include finely divided leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a distinctive member of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
