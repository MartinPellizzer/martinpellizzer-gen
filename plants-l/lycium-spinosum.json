    "intro": "Lycium spinosum, commonly known as the prickly lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Lycium spinosum is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring thick leaves and deep root systems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
