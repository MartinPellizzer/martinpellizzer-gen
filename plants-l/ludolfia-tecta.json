    "intro": "Ludolfia tecta, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body. Ludolfia tecta plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish."
