    "intro": "Lygodium conforme, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous small pinnae. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Lygodium conforme is known for its ability to climb and spread, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
