It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with distinctive warts or tubercles on the surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by yellowish or red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
