    "intro": "Leocereus bahiensis subsp. exiguospinus, commonly known as the Bahia Hedge Cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a smooth, ribbed stem and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
