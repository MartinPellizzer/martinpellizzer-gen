    "intro": "Lappula ursina, commonly known as bear's milk, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lappula ursina is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, across temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Its common name reflects the historical belief that it was used to treat ailments associated with bears."
