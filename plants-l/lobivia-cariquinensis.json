    "intro": "Lobivia cariquinensis, commonly known as the Cariquinensis Lobivia, is a species of flowering plant in the cactus family, Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of northern Chile, where it thrives in rocky soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and short, cylindrical stems covered in dense white spines. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late spring. Lobivia cariquinensis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
