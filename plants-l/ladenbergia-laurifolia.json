    "intro": "Ladenbergia laurifolia, commonly known as the African ebony, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are arranged in umbels, followed by yellowish fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its high value for timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
