    "intro": "Lepidium naufragorum, commonly known as the shipwreck weed, is a small annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard species, and is characterized by its tiny, yellow flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils along coastal areas and is often found in maritime environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Lepidium naufragorum is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal conditions."
