    "intro": "Lepanthes dichroma, commonly known as the dichromatic orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink upper lip and a deep red or purple lower lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds. Lepanthes dichroma is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique and vibrant floral display."
