    "intro": "Lubinia lubinioides, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with showy blooms. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens, though it can become invasive if not controlled. The seeds are dispersed by birds and can germinate quickly under favorable conditions."
