    "intro": "Lycopodiella mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' clubmoss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its production of spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its leaves are spiral-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lycopodiella mathewsii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
