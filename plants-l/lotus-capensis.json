It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Lotus capensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
