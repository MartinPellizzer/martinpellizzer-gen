It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often prostrate or ascending, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The fruit is a short, cylindrical silique that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
