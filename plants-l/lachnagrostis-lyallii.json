    "intro": "Lachnagrostis lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its reproductive structures are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, brownish seeds. Lachnagrostis lyallii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
