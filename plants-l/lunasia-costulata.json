    "intro": "Lunasia costulata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, finely divided leaves that give it a lacy appearance, which is characteristic of its name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant foliage and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
