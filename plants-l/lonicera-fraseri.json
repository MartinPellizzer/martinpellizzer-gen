    "intro": "Lonicera fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that ripen in the fall and are a food source for birds. Lonicera fraseri is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
