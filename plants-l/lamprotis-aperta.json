    "intro": "Lamprotis aperta, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments, helping to stabilize soil and filter water. Lamprotis aperta plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and supporting biodiversity."
