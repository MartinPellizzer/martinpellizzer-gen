    "intro": "Lecanopteris formosana, commonly known as the Formosan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are divided into small, serrated segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Lecanopteris formosana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
