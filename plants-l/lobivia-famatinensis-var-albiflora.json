It features a compact, barrel-shaped stem with a thick, fleshy texture adapted for arid environments. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically green and slightly ribbed, providing a striking contrast to its pale blooms. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
