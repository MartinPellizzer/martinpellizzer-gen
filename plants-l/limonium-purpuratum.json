    "intro": "Limonium purpuratum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in coastal areas and well-drained soils, often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and bloom in late summer. Limonium purpuratum is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions."
