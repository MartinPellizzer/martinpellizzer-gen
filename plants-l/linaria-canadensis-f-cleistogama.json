    "intro": "Linaria canadensis f. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous goldenweed, is a variant of the common toadflax. This plant is characterized by its cleistogamous flowers, which are closed and self-pollinating, a trait that enhances reproductive success in less favorable conditions. It is a herbaceous perennial native to North America, often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are typically smaller and more compact than those of the typical form. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on reproductive strategies and plant adaptation."
