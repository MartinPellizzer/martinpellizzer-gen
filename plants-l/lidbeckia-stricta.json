    "intro": "Lidbeckia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf lidbeckia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the late spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
