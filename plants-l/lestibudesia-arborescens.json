    "intro": "Lestibudesia arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It possesses a woody stem and broad, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to certain regions of South America and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
