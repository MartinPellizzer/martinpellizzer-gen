    "intro": "Leptocarpus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, egg-shaped fruits that resemble small beans. The plant thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or white, and it relies on wind pollination. Despite its common name, the plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
