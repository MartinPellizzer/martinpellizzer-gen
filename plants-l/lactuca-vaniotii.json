It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Lactuca vaniotii is not commonly cultivated for food but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
