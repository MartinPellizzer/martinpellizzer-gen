    "intro": "Lactuca plumieri, commonly known as the swamp lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant features rosettes of broad, waxy, light green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Lactuca plumieri is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
