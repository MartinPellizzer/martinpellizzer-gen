    "intro": "Lycopodioides azorica, commonly known as the Azorean clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species native to the Azores. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems and its unique adaptations to the island's climate. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserve this ancient plant species."
