    "intro": "Lerchenfeldia montana, commonly known as the mountain lerchenfeldia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
