    "intro": "Lobelia alata, commonly known as the slender cardinal flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and blooms from late summer into early fall. Lobelia alata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental value."
