    "intro": "Lolium maximum, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, coarse stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. Tall fescue is widely used in turfgrass and forage production due to its durability and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with endophytic fungi, which can influence its growth and resistance to pests."
