    "intro": "Ligularia tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive white margin, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, upright clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Ligularia tenuifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to garden landscapes."
