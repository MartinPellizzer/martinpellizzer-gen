    "intro": "Limoniastrum migiurtinum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom throughout the summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its resilience makes it an important plant in desert ecosystems."
