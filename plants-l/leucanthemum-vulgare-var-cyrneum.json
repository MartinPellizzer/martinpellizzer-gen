    "intro": "Leucanthemum vulgare var. cyrneum, commonly known as the white marguerite, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features showy white to pale yellow flowers with a prominent central disk, often surrounded by ray florets that give it a daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
