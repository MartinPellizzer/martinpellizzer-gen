    "intro": "Limnorchis graminifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and has floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Limnorchis graminifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
