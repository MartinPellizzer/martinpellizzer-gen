    "intro": "Lygodium forsteri, commonly known as the tropical climbing fern, is a member of the family Lygodiaceae. It is a climbing, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of ferns. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lygodium forsteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses."
