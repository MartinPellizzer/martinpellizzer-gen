It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive yellow center, blooming in the early morning. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in the muddy substrate of slow-moving water bodies. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
