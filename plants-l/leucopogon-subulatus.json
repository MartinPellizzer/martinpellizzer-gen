It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained sandy soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Leucopogon subulatus is adapted to coastal and inland environments, often thriving in areas with moderate rainfall."
