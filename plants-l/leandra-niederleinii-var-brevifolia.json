    "intro": "Leandra niederleinii var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf leandra, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically broad and glossy, providing a lush backdrop to the colorful inflorescences. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a challenging species to grow outside of its native environment."
