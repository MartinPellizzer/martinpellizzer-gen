    "intro": "Leontopodium giraldii, commonly known as the Edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing at elevations above 1,500 meters where the climate is cold and the soil is rocky. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is also a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
