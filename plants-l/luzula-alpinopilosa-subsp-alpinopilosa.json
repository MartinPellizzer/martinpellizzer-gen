    "intro": "Luzula alpinopilosa subsp. alpinopilosa, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomes allow it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh mountainous terrain. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
