    "intro": "Loxocarpus coodei, commonly known as the Coode's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in dense, showy clusters during the summer months. The plant has a succulent, woody stem that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. Loxocarpus coodei thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found growing near the shoreline."
