    "intro": "Lupinus polycarpus, commonly known as the everlasting lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like blue to purple flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces numerous small, showy blooms throughout the summer. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Lupinus polycarpus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
