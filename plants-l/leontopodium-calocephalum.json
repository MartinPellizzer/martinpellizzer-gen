    "intro": "Leontopodium calocephalum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a cluster of small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and beauty in harsh environments. Due to its protected status, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to prevent overharvesting in the wild."
