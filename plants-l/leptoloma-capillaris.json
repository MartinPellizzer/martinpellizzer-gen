    "intro": "Leptoloma capillaris, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which are typically tubular and attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Leptoloma capillaris thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
