    "intro": "Lycopodium membranaceum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It has a dense, mat-like growth habit with needle-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a thin, membranous sheath. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, cone-like formations called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Lycopodium membranaceum is characterized by its primitive morphology and is considered a relic from the Paleozoic era."
