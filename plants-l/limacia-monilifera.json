    "intro": "Limacia monilifera, commonly known as the bead vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and clusters of small, bead-like flowers that give it its common name. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Limacia monilifera is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
