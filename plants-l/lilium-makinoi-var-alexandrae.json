    "intro": "Lilium makinoi var. alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra lily, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
