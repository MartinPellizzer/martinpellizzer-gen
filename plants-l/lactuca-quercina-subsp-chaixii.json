It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
