    "intro": "Lappa palladini, commonly known as the Palladian hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. The plant produces small, white flowers in a dense, spherical cluster, which are followed by green, spiny fruits. It contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to skin when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
