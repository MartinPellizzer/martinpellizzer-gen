    "intro": "Lolium \u00d7 czarnohorense, commonly known as the Hungarian ryegrass, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Lolium perenne and Lolium multifidum. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant typically produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with lemmas that are often hairy. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in pastures and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value, it is valued as a forage crop."
