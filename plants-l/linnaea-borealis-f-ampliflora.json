    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. ampliflora, commonly known as the broad-flower twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, showcasing the plant's early flowering habit. This form is distinguished by its larger, more prominent flowers compared to the typical species, making it visually striking. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas."
