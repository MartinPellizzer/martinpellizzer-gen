    "intro": "Loranthus rugosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on a variety of host species including eucalyptus and acacia. Its botanical structure reflects its hemiparasitic nature, relying on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis."
