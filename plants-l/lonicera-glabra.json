    "intro": "Lonicera glabra, commonly known as the smooth honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, and often hairless leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the spring. Its berries are red and edible, though they are generally not consumed by humans. Lonicera glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
