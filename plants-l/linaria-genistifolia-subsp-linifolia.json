    "intro": "Linaria genistifolia subsp. linifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with two lips, resembling those of the common toadflax. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful management to prevent naturalization."
