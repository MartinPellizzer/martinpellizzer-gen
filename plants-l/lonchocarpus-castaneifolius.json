It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange-colored aril. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.
