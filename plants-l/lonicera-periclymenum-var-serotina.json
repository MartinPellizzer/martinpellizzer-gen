    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, blooming later in the season compared to other honeysuckle species. Its red or orange berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
