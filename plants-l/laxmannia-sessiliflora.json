    "intro": "Laxmannia sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved firecracker plant, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features upright stems covered in dense, showy red bracts that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered among the bracts. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Laxmannia sessiliflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bracts and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
