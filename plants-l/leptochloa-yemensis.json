    "intro": "Leptochloa yemensis, commonly known as Yemen grass, is a flowering plant species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
