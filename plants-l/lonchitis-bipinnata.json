    "intro": "Lonchitis bipinnata, commonly known as the two-feathered fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that give it a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, moss-like tissue, which helps in water retention. The fronds are usually green, with a smooth texture and no true veins, making it distinct from other fern species."
