    "intro": "Lysimachia keiskeana, commonly known as the Japanese mossy stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in terminal clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Lysimachia keiskeana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
