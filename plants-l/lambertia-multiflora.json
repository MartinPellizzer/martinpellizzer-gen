    "intro": "Lambertia multiflora, commonly known as the Natal glorybower, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of bright red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers that appear at the base of the bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a striking addition to any landscape."
