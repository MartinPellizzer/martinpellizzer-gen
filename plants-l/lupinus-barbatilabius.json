It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus barbatilabius is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
