    "intro": "Lotodes trianthum, commonly known as the three-leaved water plant, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features finely divided, floating leaves that are often three in number, giving it its common name. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer and are borne on slender stalks above the water surface. Lotodes trianthum plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
