    "intro": "Liparis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Liparis macrocarpa is typically found in forest understories and is adapted to humid, nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features make it a popular subject for both horticultural cultivation and ecological studies."
