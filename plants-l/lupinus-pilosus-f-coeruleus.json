It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several elliptical seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ecological benefits."
