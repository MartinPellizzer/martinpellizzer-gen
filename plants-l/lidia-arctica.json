    "intro": "Lidia arctica, commonly known as arctic lidia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters. The plant features small, showy flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against harsh cold. Lidia arctica thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments."
