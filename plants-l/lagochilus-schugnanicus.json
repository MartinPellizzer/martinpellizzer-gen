    "intro": "Lagochilus schugnanicus, commonly known as the Schugnan narrow-leaved hyacinth, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine pubescence, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
