    "intro": "Lathyrus brutius, commonly known as the Sicilian vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, and it is known for its climbing habit, often using its tendrils to ascend supports. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is typically found in dry, sunny habitats. Lathyrus brutius is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
