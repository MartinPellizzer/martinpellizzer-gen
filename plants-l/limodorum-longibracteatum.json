    "intro": "Limodorum longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract lily of the Nile, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of true lilies. The plant features a short rhizome with fleshy roots and produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, typical of many orchids. Limodorum longibracteatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is found in moist, shaded environments in its natural habitat."
