    "intro": "Lonchostephus, commonly known as the false sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of about 15 species, primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, with some species found in Asia and the Americas. The plants are herbaceous perennials, often with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped or ovate. Their flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, resembling those of true sunflowers. Lonchostephus species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant blooms and adaptability to various soil conditions."
