The plant has a dark green, leathery appearance with closely packed leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy cells. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert regions of Mexico. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
