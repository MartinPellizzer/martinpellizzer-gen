    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus var. sumenii, commonly known as the Someni pea, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple, followed by pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
