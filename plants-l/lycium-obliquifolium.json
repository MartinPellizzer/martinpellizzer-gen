    "intro": "Lycium obliquifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf lycium, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Lycium obliquifolium is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
