    "intro": "Lupinus spiraeaphilus, commonly known as the spiraeaphile lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus spiraeaphilus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a member of the legume family, which allows it to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
