    "intro": "Limonium britannicum subsp. coombense, commonly known as the Coomb's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are borne in dense, spike-like clusters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in coastal habitats."
