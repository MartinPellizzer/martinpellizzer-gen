    "intro": "Lappula cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's lappula, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. Its yellowish-green flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Lappula cusickii is often found in grasslands and shrublands, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
