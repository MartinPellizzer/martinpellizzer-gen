    "intro": "Leptodermis esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are pale yellow or greenish-white, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
