    "intro": "Lachemilla velutina, commonly known as velvet moss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety coating, giving it its common name. It is often found in forest understories and rock crevices, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Lachemilla velutina is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture due to its lush, carpet-like appearance."
