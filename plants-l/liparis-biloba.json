    "intro": "Liparis biloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Liparis biloba is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
