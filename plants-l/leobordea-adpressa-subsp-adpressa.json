    "intro": "Leobordea adpressa subsp. adpressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf leobordea, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, with a dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color, blooming during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xerophytic landscapes."
