    "intro": "Limonium gummiferum subsp. sebkarum, commonly known as the salt marsh flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
