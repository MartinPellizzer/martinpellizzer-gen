    "intro": "Linum olympicum subsp. athoum, commonly known as the Olympic flax, is a rare subspecies native to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, with showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in small, isolated populations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
