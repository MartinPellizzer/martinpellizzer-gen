    "intro": "Lepironia cuspidata, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Lepironia, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom during the day. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud, while its stems support the floating foliage. Lepironia cuspidata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
