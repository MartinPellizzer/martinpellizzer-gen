    "intro": "Lepanthes gustavoi, commonly known as the Gustavo's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, elongated spur that houses the nectar. Lepanthes gustavoi thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
