    "intro": "Lamium rubrum, commonly known as red dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically reddish-purple in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lamium rubrum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
