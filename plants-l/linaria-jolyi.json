    "intro": "Linaria jolyi, commonly known as the Joly's toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the plantain family, Plantaginaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Linaria jolyi is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is often cultivated in controlled settings due to its specific ecological requirements."
