    "intro": "Lespedeza intermedia var. alba, commonly known as white lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. White lespedeza is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
