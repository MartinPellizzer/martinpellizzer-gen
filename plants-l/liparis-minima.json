    "intro": "Liparis minima, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, small orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Liparis minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
