    "intro": "Leptospermum baccatum var. roseum, commonly known as the rosehip tea plant, is a variant of the bottlebrush shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, red-brown foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries known as rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and historical use in herbal teas contribute to its cultivation and appreciation in horticulture."
