    "intro": "Loranthus neelgherrensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
