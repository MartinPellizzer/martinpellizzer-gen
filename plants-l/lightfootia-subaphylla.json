    "intro": "Lightfootia subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lightfootia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
