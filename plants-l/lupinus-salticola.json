It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that burst open when mature, dispersing seeds forcefully. Lupinus salticola is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in open grasslands and along rocky slopes."
