    "intro": "Limonium portlandicum, commonly known as the Portland sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of England and southern Norway. It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Limonium portlandicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
