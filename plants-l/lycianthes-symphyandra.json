    "intro": "Lycianthes symphyandra, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades. It is a shrub native to Mexico and Central America, characterized by its attractive, clustered, violet-purple berries that mature in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, white, and tubular, often occurring in clusters, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The berries are edible when ripe but are generally not consumed due to their mild toxicity."
