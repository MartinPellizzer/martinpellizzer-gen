    "intro": "Loranthus miraculosus var. melaleucae, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of eucalyptus trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, glossy leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions."
