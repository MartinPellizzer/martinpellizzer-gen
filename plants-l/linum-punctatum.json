    "intro": "Linum punctatum, commonly known as the dotted flax, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers with prominent yellow markings, which give it its common name. Linum punctatum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in textile production."
