    "intro": "Lapsana communis subsp. pubescens, commonly known as hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, pubescent texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. The species is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
