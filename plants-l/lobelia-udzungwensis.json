It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are often erect. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its high-altitude habitat."
