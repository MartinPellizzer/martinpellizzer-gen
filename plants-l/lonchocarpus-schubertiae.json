    "intro": "Lonchocarpus schubertiae, commonly known as the pink velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive, pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a natural insecticide. Its botanical significance lies in its chemical compounds, including rotenone, which have been studied for their pesticidal properties."
