    "intro": "Liparis pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a delicate, branched stem and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
