    "intro": "Lactuca villosa, commonly known as woolly lettuce, is an annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the Lactuca genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Woolly lettuce is sometimes considered a weed but has been used historically in traditional medicine."
