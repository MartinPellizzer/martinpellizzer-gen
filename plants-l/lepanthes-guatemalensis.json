It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces showy, urn-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually dark green and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat.
