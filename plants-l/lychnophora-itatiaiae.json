    "intro": "Lychnophora itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia greenbark tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, dark green bark and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
