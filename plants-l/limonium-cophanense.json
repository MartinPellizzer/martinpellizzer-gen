    "intro": "Limonium cophanense, commonly known as the Cape Cod sea blush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New England. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Limonium cophanense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
