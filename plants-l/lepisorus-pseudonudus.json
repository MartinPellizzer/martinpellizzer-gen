    "intro": "Lepisorus pseudonudus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are released from small, rounded sorus structures on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus pseudonudus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
