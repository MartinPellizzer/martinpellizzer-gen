    "intro": "Landolphia reticulata, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and vibrant green color. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often opening in the early morning. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy coating. Landolphia reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
