    "intro": "Luzula comosa var. congesta, commonly known as the tufted wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. The varietal form 'congesta' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and denser flowering structures compared to the typical form."
