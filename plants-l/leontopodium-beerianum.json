    "intro": "Leontopodium beerianum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and surrounding regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow inflorescence, which resembles a flower head covered in soft, fuzzy bracts. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, producing small, showy blossoms that attract pollinators. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its native habitats."
