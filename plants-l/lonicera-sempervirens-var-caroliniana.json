    "intro": "Lonicera sempervirens var. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually orange-red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, making it an important plant for wildlife. The plant also bears small, red berries that are edible for birds but not recommended for human consumption."
