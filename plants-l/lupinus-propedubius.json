    "intro": "Lupinus propedubius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces elongated pods containing several seeds. Lupinus propedubius is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
