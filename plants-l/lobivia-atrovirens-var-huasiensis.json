    "intro": "Lobivia atrovirens var. huasiensis, commonly known as the Huasi lobivia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Andes mountains of Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and vibrant green to blue-green stems that often develop a reddish tinge when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation."
