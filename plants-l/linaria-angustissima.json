It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Linaria angustissima is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
