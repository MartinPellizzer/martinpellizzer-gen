    "intro": "Lysimachia parviflora, commonly known as small-flowered chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded areas. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it prefers damp, well-drained soils. Lysimachia parviflora is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and rocky crevices."
