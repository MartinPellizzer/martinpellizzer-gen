    "intro": "Lycurus schaffineri, commonly known as the Schaffner's lycurus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Lycurus genus. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
