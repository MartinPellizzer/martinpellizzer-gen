    "intro": "Lepisanthes divaricata, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lepisanthes divaricata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
