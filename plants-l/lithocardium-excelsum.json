    "intro": "Lithocardium excelsum, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Lithocardium excelsum thrives in rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy species suited for alpine gardens. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant for rockeries and containers."
