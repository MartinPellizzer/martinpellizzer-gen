    "intro": "Libanotis crithmoides, commonly known as the mountain thyme or sweet thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, give it a strong, spicy fragrance and make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
