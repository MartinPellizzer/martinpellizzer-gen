    "intro": "Lupinus variicolor, commonly known as the variable lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus variicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
