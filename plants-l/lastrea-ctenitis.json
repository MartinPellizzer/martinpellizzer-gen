It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant features small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowers are typically small and yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Lastrea ctenitis thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
