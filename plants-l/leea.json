    "intro": "Leea, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are typically simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in umbels or cymes, while the fruit is a three-lobed capsule. Leea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their attractive foliage."
