    "intro": "Lygodium mearnsii, commonly known as the Mearns' climbing fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb on vegetation. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant component of its native habitat."
