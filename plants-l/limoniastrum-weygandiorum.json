It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
