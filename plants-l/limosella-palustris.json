    "intro": "Limosella palustris, commonly known as marsh sandwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually opposite and linear. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Limosella palustris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
