    "intro": "Leptocaulis echinatus, commonly known as the spiny leathery plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to absorb water efficiently from the soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens and rockeries."
