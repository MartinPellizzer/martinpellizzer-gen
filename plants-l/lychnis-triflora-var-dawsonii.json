    "intro": "Lychnis triflora var. dawsonii, commonly known as Dawson's fireweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wet meadows and marshes of North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. This variety is notable for its adaptability to moist, nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
