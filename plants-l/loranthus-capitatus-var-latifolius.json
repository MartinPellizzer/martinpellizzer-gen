    "intro": "Loranthus capitatus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to its host trees through haustoria, absorbing water and nutrients. It is native to various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found on oaks and other broad-leaved trees. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, with a glossy surface, and it can grow in a shrub-like form. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting wildlife."
