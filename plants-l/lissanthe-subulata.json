    "intro": "Lissanthe subulata, commonly known as the slender lissanthe, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is native to parts of eastern Asia, including China and Japan, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It is often found in rocky or forested areas, and its growth habit is usually low and mat-forming. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
