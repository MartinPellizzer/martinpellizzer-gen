    "intro": "Lobelia scapigera var. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf bluebeard, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, tubular, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy, often with a bluish tinge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is smaller than the typical Lobelia scapigera, reaching only a few inches in height, which adds a delicate, ornamental touch to the landscape."
