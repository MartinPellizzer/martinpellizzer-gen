    "intro": "Lomaria araucana, commonly known as the Araucaria tree, is a coniferous evergreen native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown composed of scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is dark green and remains throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. Lomaria araucana is well adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
