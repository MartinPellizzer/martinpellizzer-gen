    "intro": "Lysimachia fortunei var. pubescens, commonly known as golden thread, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Small, yellow flowers bloom in early summer, adding a bright touch to shaded environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and hardiness."
