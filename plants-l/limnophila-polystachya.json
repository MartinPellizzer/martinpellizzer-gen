    "intro": "Limnophila polystachya, commonly known as water willow, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features slender, thread-like leaves that are often submerged, with occasional floating leaves at the surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the summer months. Limnophila polystachya plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
