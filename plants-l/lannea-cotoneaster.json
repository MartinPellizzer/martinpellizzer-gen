    "intro": "Lannea cotoneaster, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in spring, followed by spherical, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Lannea cotoneaster is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates. Its ornamental value and ecological importance have made it a subject of interest in horticulture and conservation efforts."
