    "intro": "Lathraea purpurea, commonly known as the purple lichen orchid, is a unique flowering plant that belongs to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Lathraea purpurea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
