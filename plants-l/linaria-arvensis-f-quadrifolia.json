It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a hairy surface. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and ecological adaptability."
