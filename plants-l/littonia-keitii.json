    "intro": "Littonia keitii, commonly known as the Keit's littonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to vibrant red. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Littonia keitii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
