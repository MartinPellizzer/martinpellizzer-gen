    "intro": "Lemna minuscula, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation, making it highly adaptable. Lemna minuscula is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can form dense mats on the water surface."
