    "intro": "Loxogramme prominens, commonly known as the broadleaf water clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its unique leaf structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
