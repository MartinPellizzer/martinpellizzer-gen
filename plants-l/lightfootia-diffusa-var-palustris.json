    "intro": "Lightfootia diffusa var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp lightfootia, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
