    "intro": "Leucanthemum maestracense, commonly known as the Maestracense Edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense white or pale yellow flower heads surrounded by fuzzy, white or pale green ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
