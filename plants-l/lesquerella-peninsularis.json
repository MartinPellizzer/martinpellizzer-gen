    "intro": "Lesquerella peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular lesquerella, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it has adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Lesquerella peninsularis produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
