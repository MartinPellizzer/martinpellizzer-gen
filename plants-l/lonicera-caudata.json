    "intro": "Lonicera caudata, commonly known as the redbank honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Lonicera caudata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to support pollinators and wildlife."
