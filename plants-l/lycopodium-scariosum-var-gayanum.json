It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces spore-bearing cones called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and spirally arranged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
