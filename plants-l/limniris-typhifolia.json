    "intro": "Limniris typhifolia, commonly known as the water lily of the marshes, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It features broad, floating leaves that provide a habitat for aquatic life, while its striking white or pink flowers bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface to repel water, and the flowers emit a mild fragrance to attract pollinators. Limniris typhifolia plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
