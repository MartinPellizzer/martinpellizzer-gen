    "intro": "Lantana fucata var. antillana, commonly known as the West Indian lantana, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry woodlands."
