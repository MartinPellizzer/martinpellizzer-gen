    "intro": "Lotodes polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often deeply lobed and provide shade to the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the early morning. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving waters. Lotodes polyphyllum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
