    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. lactiflorum, commonly known as the European privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, fleshy berries. It is often used in horticulture for its dense growth and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
