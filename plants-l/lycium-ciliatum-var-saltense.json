    "intro": "Lycium ciliatum var. saltense, commonly known as the saltbush lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green berries and silver-gray foliage, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and salt marsh habitats. Lycium ciliatum var. saltense is adapted to extreme temperatures and is resilient to drought conditions."
