    "intro": "Lathyrus articulatus, commonly known as the jointed pea, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus articulatus is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
