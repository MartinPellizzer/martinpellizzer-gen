It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lithodora kotschyi thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for horticultural use in temperate climates."
