    "intro": "Leptocarpus sanaensis, commonly known as the Sanae sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its blue to violet flowers and is typically found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. The plant has a short, erect stem with basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs. It blooms during the summer months, producing clusters of showy, papery bracts that enclose the actual flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
