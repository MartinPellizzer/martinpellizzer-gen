    "intro": "Lyonia cryptogonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, white to pale green flowers with a unique, spiral-like arrangement of petals and sepals. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many regions."
