    "intro": "Linum thesioides, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oval seeds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Linum thesioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
