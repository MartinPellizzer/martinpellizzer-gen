    "intro": "Lobelia vanreenensis var. villosula, commonly known as the hairy lobelia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
