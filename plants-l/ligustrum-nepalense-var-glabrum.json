    "intro": "Ligustrum nepalense var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth privet, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
