    "intro": "Lindera pedicellata, commonly known as the fragrant lindera, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant foliage and showy fruiting display."
