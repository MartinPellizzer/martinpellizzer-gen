It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. It is often used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth and ability to fix nitrogen. Additionally, its foliage is a valuable forage resource for livestock."
