It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which aid in water retention. Leonhardia megalorites is often found in marshy areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
