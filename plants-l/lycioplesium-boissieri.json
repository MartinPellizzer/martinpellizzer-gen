It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, spiny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red berries. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean, it is adapted to dry conditions and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
