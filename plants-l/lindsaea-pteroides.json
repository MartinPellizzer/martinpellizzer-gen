    "intro": "Lindsaea pteroides, commonly known as the feather-leaf tillandsia, is a species of epiphytic plant belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a feathery appearance. Lindsaea pteroides produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale green flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
