    "intro": "Lepanthes xenos, commonly known as the Mexican night orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking white and green flowers, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of tree trunks rather than in soil. Lepanthes xenos is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinator populations."
