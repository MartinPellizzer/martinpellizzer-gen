    "intro": "Lycopodium scariosum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a diminutive evergreen fern ally characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Native to moist, shaded environments, it thrives in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain understory ecosystems."
