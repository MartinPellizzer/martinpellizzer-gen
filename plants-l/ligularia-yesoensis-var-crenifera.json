    "intro": "Ligularia yesoensis var. crenifera, commonly known as the Japanese ligularia, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy edge, which give it its scientific name \"crenifera,\" meaning \"crenated.\" The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a spire-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and is a popular choice for water gardens and shaded borders."
