    "intro": "Leersia asperrima, commonly known as stiff leersia, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered spikes of white to pale green flowers in the summer. Leersia asperrima plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
