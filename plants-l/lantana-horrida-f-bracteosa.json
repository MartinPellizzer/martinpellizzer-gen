    "intro": "Lantana horrida f. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, oval-shaped bracts that surround the flowers, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
