It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of small, red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Litsea involucrata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
