    "intro": "Lamium amplexicaule var. aleppicum, commonly known as the Aleppo ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, with a creeping habit that allows it to spread easily. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional herbal remedies for their mild medicinal properties."
