    "intro": "Limodorum spicatum, commonly known as the spike lily or lesser lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Limodorum spicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with damp, partially shaded conditions."
