It belongs to the family Pinaceae, which includes true pines, firs, and spruces. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forest ecosystems. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
