    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in pairs, giving it the common name \"twinflower.\" The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic forests. Its unique floral structure and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of its ecosystem. Linnaea borealis f. parvula is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
