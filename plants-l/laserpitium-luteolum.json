    "intro": "Laserpitium luteolum, commonly known as yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Laserpitium luteolum is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
