    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. albosyringeus, commonly known as the white-flowered narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
