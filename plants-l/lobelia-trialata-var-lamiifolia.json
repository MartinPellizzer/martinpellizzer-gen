It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.
