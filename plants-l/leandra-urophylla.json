    "intro": "Leandra urophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are often glandular and emit a mild fragrance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Leandra urophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
