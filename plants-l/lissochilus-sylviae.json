It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
