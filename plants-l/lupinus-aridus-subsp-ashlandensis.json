    "intro": "Lupinus aridus subsp. ashlandensis, commonly known as Ashland lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like, violet to blue flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
