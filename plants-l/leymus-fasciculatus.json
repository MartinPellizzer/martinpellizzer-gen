The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Leymus fasciculatus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
