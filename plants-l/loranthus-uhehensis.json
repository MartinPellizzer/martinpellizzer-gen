    "intro": "Loranthus uhehensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
