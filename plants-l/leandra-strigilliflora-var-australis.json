    "intro": "Leandra strigilliflora var. australis, commonly known as the Australian leandra, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces showy, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
