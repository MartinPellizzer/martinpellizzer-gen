It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves, which help it adapt to its tropical and subtropical habitats. Lycianthes kaernbachii is often found in dry, open areas and can thrive in poor soils."
