    "intro": "Lupinus paniculatus var. pergracilis, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
