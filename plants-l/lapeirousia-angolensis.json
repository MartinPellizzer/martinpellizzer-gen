    "intro": "Lapeirousia angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan rain lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Lapeirousia angolensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
