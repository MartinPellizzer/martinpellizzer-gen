It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom from a central stem. Its leaves are often ribbed and can vary in color from green to reddish-brown depending on light exposure. Lachenalia aurea is well-suited to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
