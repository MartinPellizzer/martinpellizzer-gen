    "intro": "Linum corymbiferum f. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet flax, is a cultivated form of the flax plant characterized by its soft, velvety foliage. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair that gives it a tactile, silky texture. This variety is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its historical association with flax cultivation."
