    "intro": "Lightfootia brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, thick stems and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
