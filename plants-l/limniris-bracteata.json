    "intro": "Limniris bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate water willow, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and is typically found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, which are supported by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are usually elongated and opposite, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Limniris bracteata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect and aquatic organisms."
