It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Lespedeza spicata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil improvement."
