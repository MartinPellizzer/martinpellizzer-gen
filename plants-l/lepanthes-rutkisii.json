    "intro": "Lepanthes rutkisii, commonly known as the Rutkis's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, a feature common in many orchid species. Lepanthes rutkisii is characterized by its short, rhizomatous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
