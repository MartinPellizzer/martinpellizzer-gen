The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is typically found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local biodiversity."
