    "intro": "Leptostigma breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered leptostigma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae, which includes violets and related species, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pale violet or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
