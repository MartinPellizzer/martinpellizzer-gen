    "intro": "Lobelia karisimbensis, commonly known as the Karisimbe lobelia, is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Rwanda. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. Lobelia karisimbensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
