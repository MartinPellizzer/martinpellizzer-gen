    "intro": "Lanugothamnus, commonly known as the silver thyme or woolly thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, aromatic leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white. They are typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Lanugothamnus species are perennial herbs that produce seeds in capsules, and they are often used in traditional medicine for their medicinal properties. The plant's hairy leaves and compact growth habit help it conserve water in harsh environments."
