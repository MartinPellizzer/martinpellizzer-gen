    "intro": "Lucuma edulis, commonly known as the Peruvian sweet potato, is a tropical plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The fruit is typically harvested when it is fully mature, and it has a unique, sweet, custard-like flesh with a mild, nutty flavor. The plant is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental value due to its vibrant orange flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
