    "intro": "Loranthus owatarii, commonly known as the Japanese mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily members of the Rutaceae family. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem-like structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Loranthus owatarii is native to East Asia and is often found in temperate forests where its host trees thrive."
