    "intro": "Linaria glacialis, commonly known as the glacier sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters along the stems, and the plant is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. Linaria glacialis is often found in rocky or sandy habitats at high altitudes."
