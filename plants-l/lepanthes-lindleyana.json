It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes lindleyana is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
