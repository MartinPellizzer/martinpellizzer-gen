    "intro": "Leontonyx squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spiny, purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a similar fuzzy coating, providing a protective barrier against herbivores. Leontonyx squarrosus is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens."
