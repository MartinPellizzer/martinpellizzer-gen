It is characterized by its long, stiff hairs on the stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other ryegrass varieties. This plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The plant is typically found in temperate climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
