    "intro": "Linaria villosa, commonly known as the hairy toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Linaria villosa is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. It is a perennial herb that is relatively easy to grow in gardens with well-drained soil."
