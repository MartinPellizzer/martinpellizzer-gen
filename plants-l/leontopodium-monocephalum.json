    "intro": "Leontopodium monocephalum, commonly known as the single-headed edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow foliage and a single, showy flower that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is also a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
