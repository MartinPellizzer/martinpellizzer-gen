    "intro": "Loranthus sennii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Tectona. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in small groups. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by birds. Loranthus sennii is native to South and Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
