    "intro": "Leptopus dominianus, commonly known as the Dominican moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant scent. The plant has thick, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers open only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to habitat loss, Leptopus dominianus is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
