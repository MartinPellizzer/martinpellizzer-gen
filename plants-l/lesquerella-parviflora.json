    "intro": "Lesquerella parviflora, commonly known as the small-flower lesquerella, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain oily seeds, which are rich in triglycerides and have industrial applications. Lesquerella parviflora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its potential as a source of renewable oils and its role in ecological systems."
