    "intro": "Lantana \u00d7 mutabilis, commonly known as the everlasting lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that change color from white to yellow to orange to red as they age. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in many regions."
