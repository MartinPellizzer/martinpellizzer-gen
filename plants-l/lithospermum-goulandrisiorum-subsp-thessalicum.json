    "intro": "Lithospermum goulandrisiorum subsp. thessalicum, commonly known as the Thessalian lithospermum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in sunny or partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
