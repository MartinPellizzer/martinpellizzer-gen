    "intro": "Linaria arvensis var. flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with two lips, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
