    "intro": "Larrea oxycarpa, commonly known as desert tea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves contain a resinous substance that gives it a bitter taste and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
