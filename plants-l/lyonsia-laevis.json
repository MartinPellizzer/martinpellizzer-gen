    "intro": "Lyonsia laevis, commonly known as the smooth lyonsia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
