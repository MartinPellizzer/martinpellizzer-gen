    "intro": "Lettsomia adpressa, commonly known as the flat moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest floors. The plant has a distinctive morphology characterized by its closely appressed leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as peristomes, are well-developed and aid in spore dispersal. Lettsomia adpressa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
