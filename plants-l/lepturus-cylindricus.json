    "intro": "Lepturus cylindricus, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, cylindrical stems and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor waters, relying on its unique adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are typically thin and ribbon-like, facilitating efficient water movement and trapping. The reproductive structures are simple, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom above the water surface."
