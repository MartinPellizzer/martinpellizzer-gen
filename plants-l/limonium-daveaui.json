    "intro": "Limonium daveaui, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, salty environment. Limonium daveaui thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
