    "intro": "Lacis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lacis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically bright orange or yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lacis pygmaea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
