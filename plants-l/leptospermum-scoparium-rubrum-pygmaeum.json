    "intro": "Leptospermum scoparium rubrum-pygmaeum, commonly known as the silver pine or k\u0101nuka, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or greyish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. This species plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native forests and is also valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
