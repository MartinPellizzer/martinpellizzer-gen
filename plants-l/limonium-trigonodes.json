It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium trigonodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in maritime environments."
