    "intro": "Lobelia nivea, commonly known as the white lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant produces showy, clustered blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lobelia nivea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
