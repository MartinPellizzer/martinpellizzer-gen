    "intro": "Leucanthemum palmatum var. ruscinonense, commonly known as the Ruskin's white ray flover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and large, showy white ray flowers with yellow centers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. It produces small, dark brown achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
