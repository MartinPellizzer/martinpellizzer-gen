    "intro": "Leucosalpa, commonly known as the white lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and phototrophic partners. Leucosalpa plays a crucial role in ecological systems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms. Its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes make it an important indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health."
