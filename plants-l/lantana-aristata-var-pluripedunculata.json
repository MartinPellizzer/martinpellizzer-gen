    "intro": "Lantana aristata var. pluripedunculata, commonly known as the clustered lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense foliage make it both a decorative and potentially invasive species in some areas."
