    "intro": "Linagrostis alpina, commonly known as alpine grass or mountain grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cold and dry conditions. The plant has slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually pale blue or white, and it blooms during the short growing season of alpine environments. Linagrostis alpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
