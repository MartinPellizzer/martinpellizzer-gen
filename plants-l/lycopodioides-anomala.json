It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Lycopodioides anomala plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
