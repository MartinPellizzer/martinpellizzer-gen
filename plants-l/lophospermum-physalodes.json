    "intro": "Lophospermum physalodes, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardens."
