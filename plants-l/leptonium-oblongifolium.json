    "intro": "Leptonium oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf leptonium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, elongated, and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
