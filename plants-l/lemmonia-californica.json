    "intro": "Lemmonia californica, commonly known as the California lemmingia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
