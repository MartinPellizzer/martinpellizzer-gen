    "intro": "Leiothrix mucronata, commonly known as the African violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Leiothrix mucronata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
