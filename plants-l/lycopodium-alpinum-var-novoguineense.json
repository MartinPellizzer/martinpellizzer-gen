    "intro": "Lycopodium alpinum var. novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a compact, branching structure that resembles a club. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool and humid conditions. Its sporophytic stage produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobili at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium alpinum var. novoguineense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
