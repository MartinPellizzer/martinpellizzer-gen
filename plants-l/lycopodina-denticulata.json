    "intro": "Lycopodina denticulata, commonly known as the toothed lycopod, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or shaded soils. The plant produces microspores and megaspores in specialized structures called strobili, which are typical of primitive vascular plants. Lycopodina denticulata is adapted to moist, humid environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
