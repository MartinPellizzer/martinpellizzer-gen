    "intro": "Lycium scoparium, commonly known as silverberry, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has a dense, sprawling growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Lycium scoparium is also known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
