It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its ability to spread via stolons.
