    "intro": "Leptostelma donianum, commonly known as the mountain marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, erect stem and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
