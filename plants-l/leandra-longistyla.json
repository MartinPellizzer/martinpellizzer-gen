    "intro": "Leandra longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled leandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature two long, slender stamens. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by various bird species. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface that helps in water retention in its humid, shaded habitat. Leandra longistyla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
