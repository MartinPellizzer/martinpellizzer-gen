    "intro": "Lycianthes medians, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that appear in late summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The berries are edible but typically consumed by birds rather than humans."
