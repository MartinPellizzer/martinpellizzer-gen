    "intro": "Lagotis ramalana, commonly known as the Ramalanan bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lagotis ramalana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
