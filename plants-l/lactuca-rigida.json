    "intro": "Lactuca rigida, commonly known as rigid lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is native to the western United States and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Lactuca rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
