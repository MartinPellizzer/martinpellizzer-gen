    "intro": "Linum alpinum subsp. julicum, commonly known as Alpine flax or July flax, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and alpine plant collections."
