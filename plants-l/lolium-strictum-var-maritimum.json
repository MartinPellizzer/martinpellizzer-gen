    "intro": "Lolium strictum var. maritimum, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it well-adapted to coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
