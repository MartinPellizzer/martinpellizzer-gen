    "intro": "Lomaria vulcanica, commonly known as the fire lily, is a rare flowering plant native to volcanic regions. It thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils found in areas with recent volcanic activity. The plant features striking red and orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Lomaria vulcanica is noted for its resilience to high temperatures and low rainfall."
