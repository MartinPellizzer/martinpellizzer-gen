    "intro": "Litanthus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf litanthus, is a small flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats on the ground. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
