    "intro": "Lotus campylocladus var. hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's lotus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous or forested areas. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
