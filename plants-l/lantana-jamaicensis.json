    "intro": "Lantana jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican lantana, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lantana jamaicensis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It is also known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
