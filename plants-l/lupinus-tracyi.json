It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus tracyi plays an important role in ecological systems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
