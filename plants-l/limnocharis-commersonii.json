    "intro": "Limnocharis commersonii, commonly known as water spinach or Brazilian watercress, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant has long, slender, edible leaves that are often used in culinary applications, particularly in Latin American cuisine. Its growth is rapid, allowing it to spread quickly in suitable habitats. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
