    "intro": "Lycium bosciifolium, commonly known as the Bosciifolium boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Lycium bosciifolium is often found in rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
