    "intro": "Liparis chimanimaniensis, commonly known as the Chimanimani orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Chimanimani Mountains of eastern Zimbabwe. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming during the late summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
