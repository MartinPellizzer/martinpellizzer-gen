    "intro": "Leontodon atratus, commonly known as the black leontodon, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a composite head. Leontodon atratus is often used in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
