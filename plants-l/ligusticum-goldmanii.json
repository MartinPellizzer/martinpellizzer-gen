    "intro": "Ligusticum goldmanii, commonly known as golden thread, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its native habitat. Ligusticum goldmanii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
