It is characterized by its vivid red tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. It has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different flower structure compared to other lobelia species."
