    "intro": "Leda obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, crust-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish-green color. The plant's structure consists of a fungal component and algal symbionts that work together for nutrient absorption. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality."
