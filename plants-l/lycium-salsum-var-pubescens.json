    "intro": "Lycium salsum var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. This species is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in challenging conditions."
