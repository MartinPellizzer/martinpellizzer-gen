    "intro": "Ligularia cebennensis, commonly known as the Cebenna ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
