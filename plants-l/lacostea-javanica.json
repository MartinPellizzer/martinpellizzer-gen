    "intro": "Lacostea javanica, commonly known as the Javanese orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces small, clustered blooms in shades of white and yellow. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
