It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many showy flowering plants. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. It produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
