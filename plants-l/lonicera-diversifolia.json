    "intro": "Lonicera diversifolia, commonly known as the variable honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and slightly pubescent on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its berries are red or orange and are edible, though not as commonly consumed as those of other honeysuckle species. Lonicera diversifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
