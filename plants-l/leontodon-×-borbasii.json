    "intro": "Leontodon \u00d7 borbasii, commonly known as the hybrid false dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It is a sterile hybrid between Leontodon saxatilis and Leontodon autumnalis, which contributes to its limited natural distribution. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
