    "intro": "Lozania bipinnata, commonly known as the two-feathered fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Lozania bipinnata is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
