    "intro": "Luzula pediformis subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant forms dense, grass-like clumps with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purplish in color. Its leaves are linear, grass-like, and arranged in a basal rosette, while the inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in wet, acidic soils and its ecological role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
