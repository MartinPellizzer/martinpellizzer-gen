    "intro": "Lithops turbiniformis, commonly known as the \"turban lithops,\" is a member of the Aizoaceae family native to South Africa. It is a succulent plant characterized by its two fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble miniature stone-like formations. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, which are often covered in a layer of fine, white hair. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Lithops turbiniformis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
