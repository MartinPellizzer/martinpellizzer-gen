    "intro": "Lamium ladanum, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a basal rosette of aromatic, heart-shaped leaves that emit a distinctive, sweet scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their carminative and digestive properties. Lamium ladanum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens."
