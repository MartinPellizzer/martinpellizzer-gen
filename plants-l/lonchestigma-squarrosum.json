    "intro": "Lonchestigma squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosum bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and distinctive, inflated pods that resemble bladders. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, rounded seeds. Lonchestigma squarrosum is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
