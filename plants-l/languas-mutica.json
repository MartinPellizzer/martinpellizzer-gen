    "intro": "Languas mutica, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its velvety, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often lobed and have a distinctive waxy texture. Languas mutica is also known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
