    "intro": "Lyonia myrtilloides var. parvifolia, commonly known as dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring. These flowers give way to edible, dark blue berries that are similar in taste to true blueberries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
