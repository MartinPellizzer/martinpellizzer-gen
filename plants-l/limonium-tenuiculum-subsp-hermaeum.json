It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to tolerate saline and sandy soils. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is often found along dunes or in coastal grasslands. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and coastal landscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other members of the Limonium genus."
