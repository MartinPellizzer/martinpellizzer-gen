    "intro": "Linum narbonense f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf flax, is a botanical variant of the flax species Linum narbonense. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. This subspecies is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its fibrous stems, which can be used in textile production."
