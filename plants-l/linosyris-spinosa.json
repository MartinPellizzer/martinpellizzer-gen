It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are often covered in stiff, spiny hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Linosyris spinosa is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
