    "intro": "Lecythis venusta, commonly known as the golden balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody, spiky capsule that splits open to release seeds. The wood of Lecythis venusta is lightweight and historically used for buoyant applications, though it is now more valued for its ecological role in rainforest ecosystems."
