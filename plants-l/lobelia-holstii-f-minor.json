It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and vibrant floral display."
