    "intro": "Lobivia cinnabarina subvar. oligotricha, commonly known as the Pink Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white or pale green hairs. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its foliage is reduced to tubercles, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
