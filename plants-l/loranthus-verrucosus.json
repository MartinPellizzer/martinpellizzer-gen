    "intro": "Loranthus verrucosus, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain several seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus verrucosus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and providing food for various wildlife species."
