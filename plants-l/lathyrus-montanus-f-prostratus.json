    "intro": "Lathyrus montanus f. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate mountain vetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and lance-shaped. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine environments, showing resilience to cold and poor soil conditions."
