    "intro": "Loranthus acacioides, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily from the Acacia genus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has a short, branched stem with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that releases sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of host trees. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of India, Southeast Asia, and Africa."
