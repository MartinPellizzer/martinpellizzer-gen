    "intro": "Loxotrema castanea, commonly known as the chestnut tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that grows on tree bark, particularly on chestnut trees. It has a dark green to blackish upper surface with a powdery coating and a lighter, leathery underside. The thallus is composed of a complex interwoven network of hyphae, and it lacks distinct lobes or leaf-like structures. It is often found in temperate regions and is associated with specific host trees. This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its environment."
