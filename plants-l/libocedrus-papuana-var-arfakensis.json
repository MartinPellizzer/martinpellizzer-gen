    "intro": "Libocedrus papuana var. arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfaken Island cedar, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the island of Arfaken in the Banda Sea. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its wood is valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is not widely used commercially. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
