It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The Texas bluebonnet is the state flower of Texas and plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen into the soil."
