    "intro": "Lachnagrostis littoralis subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, tufted blades that are often covered in short, silky hairs. This plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Its flowering spikes are typically inconspicuous, with small, wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
