    "intro": "Lupinus laetus, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its silvery-blue flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a short, upright stem with clusters of small, pea-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Lupinus laetus is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it valuable for soil enrichment."
