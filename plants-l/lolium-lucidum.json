    "intro": "Lolium lucidum, commonly known as the shining grass, is a species of annual grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Lolium lucidum is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
