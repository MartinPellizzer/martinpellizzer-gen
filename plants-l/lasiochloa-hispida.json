    "intro": "Lasiochloa hispida, commonly known as the hairy hairgrass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry leaves covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along streambanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Lasiochloa hispida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
