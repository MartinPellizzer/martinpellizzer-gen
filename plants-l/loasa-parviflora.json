    "intro": "Loasa parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered loasa, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Loasa parviflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
