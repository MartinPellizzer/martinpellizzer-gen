It features slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and erosion control capabilities. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for gardens and restoration projects."
