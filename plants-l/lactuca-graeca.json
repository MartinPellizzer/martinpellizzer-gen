    "intro": "Lactuca graeca, commonly known as Greek endive, is a species of lettuce native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its curly, dark green leaves that are often used in salads or cooked dishes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has a rosette-like growth pattern. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a head-like inflorescence, and it produces small, oblong seeds. Lactuca graeca is also known for its slightly bitter taste, which is more pronounced in the older leaves."
