    "intro": "Lycopodiella carnosa, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and produce spores for propagation. Lycopodiella carnosa is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
