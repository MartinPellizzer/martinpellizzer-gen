    "intro": "Lavandula pyrenaica, commonly known as Pyrenean lavender, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant features aromatic, narrow leaves and spikes of purple flowers that bloom in summer. It is closely related to other lavender species but is distinguished by its smaller stature and specific habitat preferences. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
