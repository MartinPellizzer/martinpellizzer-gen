It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime habitats. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
