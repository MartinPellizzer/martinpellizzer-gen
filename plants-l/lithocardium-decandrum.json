    "intro": "Lithocardium decandrum, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Lithocardium decandrum is often used in rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
