    "intro": "Liabum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a fibrous root system. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Liabum lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
