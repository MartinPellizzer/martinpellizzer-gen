    "intro": "Leptactina benguelensis subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the Benguela pubescent lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is characterized by its foliose thallus with a leathery texture and a distinctive, pale green to yellowish-green color. The plant exhibits a dense covering of short, stiff hairs, which gives it its subspecific name \"pubescens.\" It typically grows on bark and stone in humid, temperate regions. This lichen is often found in coastal areas and is an indicator species for certain environmental conditions."
