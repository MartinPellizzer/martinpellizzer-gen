    "intro": "Lobelia dopatrioides, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
