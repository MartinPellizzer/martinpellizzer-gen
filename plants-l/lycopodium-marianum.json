    "intro": "Lycopodium marianum, commonly known as the Marian clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, cone-like structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its reproductive structures develop from specialized leaves called sporophylls, which bear spores in clusters. Lycopodium marianum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
