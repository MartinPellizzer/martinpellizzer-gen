    "intro": "Luzula multiflora var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high elevations, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize open, disturbed areas in mountainous environments. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats."
