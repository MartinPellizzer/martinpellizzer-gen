    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen perennial plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its feathery, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from true mosses and ferns. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution."
