    "intro": "Lysinema purpurascens var. lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-flowered lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a leathery, pale green to reddish upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. The thallus is composed of a complex network of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form the lichen's symbiotic structure. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. This variety is distinguished by its lilac-colored lobes, which give it its common name."
