It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of violet or red flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
