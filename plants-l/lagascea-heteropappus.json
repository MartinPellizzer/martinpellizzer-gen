    "intro": "Lagascea heteropappus, commonly known as the velvetleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
