It is characterized by its yellowish fruits, which distinguish it from the typical red or black fruits of other Lindera species. The plant is a shrub native to eastern Asia, including regions of China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly serrated margin."
