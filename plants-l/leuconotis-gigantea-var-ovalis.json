It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
