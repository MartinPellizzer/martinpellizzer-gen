    "intro": "Lespedeza praecox var. tomentella, commonly known as silverleaf lespedeza, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and small, fluffy seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces pink to reddish-purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lespedeza praecox var. tomentella is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
