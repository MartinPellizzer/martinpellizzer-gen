    "intro": "Lasiorrhiza tenerifolia, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate orchid-like flowers in shades of white and purple. It is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
