    "intro": "Lycopodium furcellatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces strobila (cone-like structures) that contain sporangia. Lycopodium furcellatum is characterized by its ability to reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various organisms."
