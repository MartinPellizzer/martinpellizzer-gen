    "intro": "Linaria parvula, commonly known as the dwarf toadflax, is a small, annual flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant is characterized by its two-lipped flowers that resemble the shape of a toad's mouth, giving it its common name. Linaria parvula thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
