    "intro": "Listera convallarioides f. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leafed basket lily, is a variant of the basket lily species native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with delicate, heart-shaped leaves that often form a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typical of the Primulaceae family. Its foliage is characterized by a trifoliate structure, with three leaflets arranged symmetrically. This form is a naturally occurring variation that adds to the botanical diversity within the species."
