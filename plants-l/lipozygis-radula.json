    "intro": "Lipozygis radula, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant belonging to the Rhizophoraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that extend into the water, providing structural support in tidal zones. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems along coastlines. Its leaves are typically\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, with the plant relying on wind and water for pollination and seed dispersal."
