    "intro": "Laguncularia lutea, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in saline or brackish water environments. The plant has small, yellowish-green leaves and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, aiding in soil stabilization. Laguncularia lutea plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to coastal protection."
