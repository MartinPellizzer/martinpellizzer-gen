    "intro": "Lindera umbellata var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in umbel-like clusters during early spring. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
