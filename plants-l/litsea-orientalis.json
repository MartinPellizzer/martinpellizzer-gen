    "intro": "Litsea orientalis, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood or oriental litsea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its aromatic wood and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
