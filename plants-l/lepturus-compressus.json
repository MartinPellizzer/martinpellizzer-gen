    "intro": "Lepturus compressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like thallus with a dark green to brownish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis and decomposition. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator of air quality and ecological health."
