    "intro": "Liparis violaceonervosa, commonly known as the violet-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple veining. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a violet or purple lip. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
