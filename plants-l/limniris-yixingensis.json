    "intro": "Limniris yixingensis, commonly known as the Yixing water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limniris yixingensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
