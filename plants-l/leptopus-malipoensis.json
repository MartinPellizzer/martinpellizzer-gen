    "intro": "Leptopus malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo leptopus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yunnan province in China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, with a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptopus malipoensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
