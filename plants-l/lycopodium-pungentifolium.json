    "intro": "Lycopodium pungentifolium, commonly known as the stinging pine or stinging clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its spore-bearing cones and spore-producing structures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sporophylls, are clustered in cones and produce spores that are dispersed by wind. Lycopodium pungentifolium plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
