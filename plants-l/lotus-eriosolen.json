    "intro": "Lotus eriosolen, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has a complex root system that helps stabilize the water body it inhabits. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which aid in water retention and provide a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Lotus eriosolen plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by improving water quality and supporting biodiversity."
