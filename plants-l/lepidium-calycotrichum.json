It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly peppery taste, which is characteristic of many members of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Lepidium calycotrichum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
