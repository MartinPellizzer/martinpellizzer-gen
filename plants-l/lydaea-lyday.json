    "intro": "Lydaea lyday, commonly known as the Lyday's lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the Pacific Northwest. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lydaea lyday is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
