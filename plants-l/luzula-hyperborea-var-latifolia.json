    "intro": "Luzula hyperborea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mountain sedge, is a perennial plant native to alpine and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its leaves are broad and flat, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, clustered flower spikes in the summer. This variant is distinguished by its wider leaves compared to other Luzula species, making it easily identifiable in its natural environment."
