    "intro": "Lycopodium feeanum, commonly known as the Feegan's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium feeanum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky soils. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological succession make it a notable species in botanical studies."
