    "intro": "Linum squarrosum subsp. squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrose flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its historical use in textile production and as a source of oil has contributed to its significance in botanical and agricultural studies."
