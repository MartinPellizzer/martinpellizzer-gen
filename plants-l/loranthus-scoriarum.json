    "intro": "Loranthus scoriarum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, such as apple and oak. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in holiday decorations. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, though it is not typically fatal."
