    "intro": "Luma cinerea, commonly known as the silver luma, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering its leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Luma cinerea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and along stream banks."
