It is a perennial grass-like plant that forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender spikes. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and the delicate, long-lasting flowers."
