It is characterized by its small, lens-shaped seeds that are typically yellow or green in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing the edible seeds. It is a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained soils and is widely cultivated for its nutritional value. Lens disperma is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting subsequent crop growth."
