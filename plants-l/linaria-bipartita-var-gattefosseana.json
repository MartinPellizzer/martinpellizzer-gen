    "intro": "Linaria bipartita var. gattefosseana, commonly known as the Gattefosse's toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and vibrant yellow-orange flowers with two distinct lobes. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
