    "intro": "Lindsaea merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill\u2019s spikemoss, is a member of the family Lindsaeaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. Lindsaea merrillii reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
