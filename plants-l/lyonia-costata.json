    "intro": "Lyonia costata, commonly known as the beaked lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves with a distinctive beak-like tip. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Lyonia costata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
