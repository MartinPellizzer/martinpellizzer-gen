    "intro": "Leontopodium discolor, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow inflorescence, which consists of many small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with poor soil and harsh weather conditions. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and alpine beauty. Due to its restricted range and vulnerability to climate change, it is also a protected species in several European countries."
