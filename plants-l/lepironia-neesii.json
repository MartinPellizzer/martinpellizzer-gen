    "intro": "Lepironia neesii, commonly known as the water lily of Assam, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of northeastern India. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its root system helps stabilize the soil, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats. The flowers attract pollinators such as beetles and bees, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
