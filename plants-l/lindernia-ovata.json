    "intro": "Lindernia ovata, commonly known as the narrowleaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, narrow, ovate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lindernia ovata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
