    "intro": "Lepigonum marinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Its unique morphology allows it to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Lepigonum marinum is often found in dunes and rocky shores, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats."
