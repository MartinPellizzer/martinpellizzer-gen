    "intro": "Lycopodium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrulate clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and needle-like leaves that are often serrated, giving it its common name. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium serrulatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, and is native to parts of North America. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
