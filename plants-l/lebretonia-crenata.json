    "intro": "Lebretonia crenata, commonly known as the smooth sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Lebretonia crenata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
