    "intro": "Lygodesmia minor, commonly known as the small lygodium, is a small, climbing fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
