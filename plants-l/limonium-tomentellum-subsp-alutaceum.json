It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
