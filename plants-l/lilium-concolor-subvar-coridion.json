    "intro": "Lilium concolor subvar. coridion, commonly known as the Sierra White Lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It is a perennial herb with showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forested areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
