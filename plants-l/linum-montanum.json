It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Linum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
