    "intro": "Limonium nudum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Limonium nudum is often found in dunes and saline soils, where it thrives in harsh conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal climates."
