    "intro": "Lonicera dioica subvar. dasygyna, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The berries that follow the flowers are red and edible, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
