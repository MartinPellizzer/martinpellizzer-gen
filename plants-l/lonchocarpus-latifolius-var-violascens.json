    "intro": "Lonchocarpus latifolius var. violascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf senna, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that often display a striking violet or purple hue, especially under sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
