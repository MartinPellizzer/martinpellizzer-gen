    "intro": "Linaria heterophylla var. subsabulicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with linear, often hairy leaves adapted to sandy and well-drained soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice in native plant gardens."
