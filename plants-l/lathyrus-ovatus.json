    "intro": "Lathyrus ovatus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system. Lathyrus ovatus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
