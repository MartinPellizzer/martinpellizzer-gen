    "intro": "Lygos sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-fruit, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, red berries, which are a key feature of its botanical description. These berries are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor. Lygos sphaerocarpa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
