    "intro": "Loranthus destructor, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host trees if left unchecked."
