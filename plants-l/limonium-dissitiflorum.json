    "intro": "Limonium dissitiflorum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shore. Limonium dissitiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
