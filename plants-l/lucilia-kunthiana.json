    "intro": "Lucilia kunthiana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 5 meters, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Lucilia kunthiana is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
