    "intro": "Lolium decipiens, commonly known as false grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for true grasses. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Lolium decipiens is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
