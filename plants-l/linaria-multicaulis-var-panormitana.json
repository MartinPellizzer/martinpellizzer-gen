    "intro": "Linaria multicaulis var. panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitana toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that often grow from a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its flowers have four petals, with two larger ones that curve outward, resembling a toad's mouth, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
