    "intro": "Limnochloa acutangula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found near the base of the stems. Limnochloa acutangula thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native habitat."
