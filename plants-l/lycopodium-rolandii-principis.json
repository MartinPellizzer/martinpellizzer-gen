    "intro": "Lycopodium rolandii-principis, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, needle-like leaves that form dense, tuft-like clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky areas. Lycopodium rolandii-principis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
