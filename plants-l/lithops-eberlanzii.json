    "intro": "Lithops eberlanzii, commonly known as the \"Fairy Stone,\" is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, rock-like appearance, with two fused leaves that resemble stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring. Lithops eberlanzii is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and striking aesthetic."
