    "intro": "Lonicera chaetocarpa, commonly known as the roughfruit honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, red, fleshy drupe that ripens in the summer and is edible for birds and small mammals. Lonicera chaetocarpa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
