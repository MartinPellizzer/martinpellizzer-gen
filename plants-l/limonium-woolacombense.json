    "intro": "Limonium woolacombense, commonly known as the wooly sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wooly foliage and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates with salty sea breezes. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
