    "intro": "Lithodora hispidula subsp. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica germander, is a perennial herb native to North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, sky-blue to violet flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
