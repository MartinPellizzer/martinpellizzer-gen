It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, black berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
