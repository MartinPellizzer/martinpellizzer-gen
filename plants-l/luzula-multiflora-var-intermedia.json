    "intro": "Luzula multiflora var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, with a dense, compact growth habit. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered spikes of white or pale blue flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
