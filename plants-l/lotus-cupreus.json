    "intro": "Lotus cupreus, commonly known as the copperleaf lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant copper-colored leaves that resemble those of the lotus, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are typically pink or red, emerging above the water surface. Lotus cupreus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
