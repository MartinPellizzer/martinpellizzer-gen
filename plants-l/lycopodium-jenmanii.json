    "intro": "Lycopodium jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit with whorled leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores, a feature typical of clubmosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
