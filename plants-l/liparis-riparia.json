    "intro": "Liparis riparia, commonly known as the river orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and bears small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer. Liparis riparia is notable for its ability to adapt to fluctuating water levels, making it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
