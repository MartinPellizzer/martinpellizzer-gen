    "intro": "Liparis pusilla var. breviscapa, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its short stature and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and bog gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
