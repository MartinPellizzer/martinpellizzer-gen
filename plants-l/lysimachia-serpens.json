It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or along stream banks. Lysimachia serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes."
