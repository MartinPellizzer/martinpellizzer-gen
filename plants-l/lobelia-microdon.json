    "intro": "Lobelia microdon, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or small containers. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, thriving in woodland environments. Lobelia microdon is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
