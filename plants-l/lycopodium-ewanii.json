    "intro": "Lycopodium ewanii, commonly known as the Ewan's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Lycopodium ewanii is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and botanical importance."
