    "intro": "Lobelia puberula var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. Its small, tubular flowers are usually blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the branches. This variety is characterized by its reduced flowering, with fewer blooms compared to other lobelia species."
