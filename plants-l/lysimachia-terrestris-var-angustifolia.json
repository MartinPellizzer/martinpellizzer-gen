    "intro": "Lysimachia terrestris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features slender, angular stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are usually arranged alternately along the stems. Small, bright yellow flowers appear in clusters at the ends of the stems, typically in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
