    "intro": "Leobordea laticeps, commonly known as the broad-headed leobordea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a velvety texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, Leobordea laticeps is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
