    "intro": "Larix \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid larch, is a deciduous conifer that combines traits from its parent species, the European larch (Larix decidua) and the Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi). It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before falling, giving it a striking seasonal appearance. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is widely cultivated in temperate regions across Europe and North America."
