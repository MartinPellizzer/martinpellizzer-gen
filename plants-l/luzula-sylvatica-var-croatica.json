    "intro": "Luzula sylvatica var. croatica, commonly known as the Croatian wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks."
