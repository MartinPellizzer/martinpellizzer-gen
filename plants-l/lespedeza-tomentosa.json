    "intro": "Lespedeza tomentosa, commonly known as woolly lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, three-lobed seeds. Woolly lespedeza is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
