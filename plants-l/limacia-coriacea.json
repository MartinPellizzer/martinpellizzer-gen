It is characterized by its hairy, ribbed stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite flower heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Limacia coriacea is valued for its edible leaves, which have a slightly bitter taste and are used in various culinary traditions."
