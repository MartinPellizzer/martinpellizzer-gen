    "intro": "Lopholepis piloselloides, commonly known as the hairy field fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Lopholepis piloselloides plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
