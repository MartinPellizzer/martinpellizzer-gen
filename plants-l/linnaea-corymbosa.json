    "intro": "Linnaea corymbosa, commonly known as the twinflower, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and its distinctive pairs of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Linnaea corymbosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitats."
