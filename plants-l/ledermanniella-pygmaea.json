    "intro": "Ledermanniella pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows close to the ground, often forming dense mats in its alpine habitat. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
