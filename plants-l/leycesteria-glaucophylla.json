    "intro": "Leycesteria glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leafed honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to New Zealand. It features slender, arching branches with small, ovate leaves that have a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators like moths and birds. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and delicate floral display. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
