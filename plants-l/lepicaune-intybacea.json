    "intro": "Lepicaune intybacea, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms during the spring season. Due to habitat loss, Lepicaune intybacea is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
