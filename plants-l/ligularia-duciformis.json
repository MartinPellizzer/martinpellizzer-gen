    "intro": "Ligularia duciformis, commonly known as the giant leopard plant, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a distinctive yellow-green coloration and prominent veins. The plant produces tall, spire-like inflorescences of yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
