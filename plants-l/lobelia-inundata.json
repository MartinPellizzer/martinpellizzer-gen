    "intro": "Lobelia inundata, commonly known as the water lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, usually oval-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lobelia inundata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
