It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important crops. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a peppery taste. It is sometimes used in herbal remedies and as a green manure crop due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing properties."
