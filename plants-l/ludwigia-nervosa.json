    "intro": "Ludwigia nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Ludwigia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with four petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Ludwigia nervosa is often found in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
