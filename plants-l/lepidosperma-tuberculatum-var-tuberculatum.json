    "intro": "Lepidosperma tuberculatum var. tuberculatum, commonly known as the tuberculate sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale brown flowers. This variety is notable for its distinctive tuberculate (knobbed) nodes along the stem, which are a key identifying feature."
