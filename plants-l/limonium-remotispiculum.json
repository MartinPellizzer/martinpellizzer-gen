    "intro": "Limonium remotispiculum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically on sturdy, upright stems. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, adapted to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. Limonium remotispiculum is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it tolerates harsh maritime conditions. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
