    "intro": "Lithocardium adnatum, commonly known as the smooth lithocardium, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of wax, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and bloom during the spring and summer months."
