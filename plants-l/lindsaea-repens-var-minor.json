    "intro": "Lindsaea repens var. minor, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are typically linear to ovate, with a glossy green surface and a finely toothed margin. It produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
