    "intro": "Leersia aristata, commonly known as purple moorgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in moist areas. Leersia aristata is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
