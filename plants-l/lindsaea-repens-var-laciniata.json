    "intro": "Lindsaea repens var. laciniata, commonly known as the fragrant lindsaea, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often exhibit a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for humid indoor cultivation."
