    "intro": "Luzula abyssinica var. volkensii, commonly known as the Ethiopian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. It has a compact growth form with short, upright stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
