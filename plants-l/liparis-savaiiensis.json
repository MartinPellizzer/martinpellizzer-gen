    "intro": "Liparis savaiiensis, commonly known as the Savaii orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a yellow lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, typically between November and March. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
