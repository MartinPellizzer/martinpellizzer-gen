    "intro": "Lotus tenuis, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Lotus tenuis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
