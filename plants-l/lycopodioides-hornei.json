    "intro": "Lycopodioides hornei, commonly known as the Horne's clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb with a creeping rhizome and erect, slender stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes with spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodioides hornei is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
