    "intro": "Libidibia glabrata, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
