    "intro": "Limonium mucronatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, showing a high tolerance for saline conditions. Its small, narrow leaves are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. Limonium mucronatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
