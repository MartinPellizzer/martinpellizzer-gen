    "intro": "Lindsaea raddiana, commonly known as the red-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats. Lindsaea raddiana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
