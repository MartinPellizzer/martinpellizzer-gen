    "intro": "Loranthus divaricatus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through the sugars it produces. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and Africa, often found in temperate and subtropical regions."
