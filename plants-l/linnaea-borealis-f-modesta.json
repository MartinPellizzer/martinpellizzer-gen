    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. modesta, commonly known as the modest twinflower, is a rare and low-growing shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are oval-shaped and dark green, and the plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
