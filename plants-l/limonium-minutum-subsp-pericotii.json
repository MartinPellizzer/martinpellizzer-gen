    "intro": "Limonium minutum subsp. pericotii, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is adapted to withstand salty air and coastal conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging coastal climates."
