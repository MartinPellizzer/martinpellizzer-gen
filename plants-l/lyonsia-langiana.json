    "intro": "Lyonsia langiana, commonly known as the Langiana lichen, is a type of foliose lichen that grows on tree trunks and branches in temperate regions. It has a distinctive greenish-yellow to brownish-green coloration and a leathery texture. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic algae and a fungus. It often forms dense patches and is commonly found in shaded, moist environments. This lichen is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
