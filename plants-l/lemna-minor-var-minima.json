    "intro": "Lemna minor var. minima, commonly known as the least duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant floats on the surface of freshwater bodies and reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation. It lacks true roots and has a simple, stemless structure. This species is often used in ecological studies due to its fast growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions."
