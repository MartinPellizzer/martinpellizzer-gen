    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, though it is often mistaken for a shrub due to its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features upright, cylindrical stems that are glabrous, or smooth, and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette at the base. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
