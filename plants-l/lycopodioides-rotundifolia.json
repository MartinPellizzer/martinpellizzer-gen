    "intro": "Lycopodioides rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Lycopodioides rotundifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
