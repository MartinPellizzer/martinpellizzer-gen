    "intro": "Loranthus samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to the islands of Samoa and nearby regions in the South Pacific. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. Its small, white or pale green flowers are typically visited by insects for pollination. The berries it produces are consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal."
