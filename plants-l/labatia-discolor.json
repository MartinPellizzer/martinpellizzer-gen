    "intro": "Labatia discolor, commonly known as the variable morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that change color from bright green to yellow or white as the plant matures. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often appearing in clusters. Labatia discolor is a climbing vine that thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
