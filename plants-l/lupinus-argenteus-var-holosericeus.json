It is characterized by its silvery-white to grayish foliage and erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system fixes nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
