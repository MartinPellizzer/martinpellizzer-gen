    "intro": "Laburnum vulgare f. chrysophyllum, commonly known as the golden laburnum, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its drooping, golden-yellow flowers that appear in early spring, creating a striking display. The plant has slender, branching stems with alternate, pinnate leaves composed of 10\u201320 small, oval leaflets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden borders or containers. Due to its toxic seeds, it should be planted with caution, especially in areas accessible to children and pets."
