It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, recurved, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces large, showy, multi-petaled blooms that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
