    "intro": "Lycopodioides flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around its central stem. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper part of the plant and contain sporangia that release spores for reproduction. Lycopodioides flabellata is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in maintaining soil stability in forest understories."
