    "intro": "Limnophila wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's waterweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its small, green leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white.
