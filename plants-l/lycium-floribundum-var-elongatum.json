    "intro": "Lycium floribundum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated boxthorn, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. The berries it produces are red and edible, though they are typically consumed by birds rather than humans."
