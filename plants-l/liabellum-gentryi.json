    "intro": "Liabellum gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's liabellum, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pleated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical researchers. Conservation efforts are ongoing due to threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
