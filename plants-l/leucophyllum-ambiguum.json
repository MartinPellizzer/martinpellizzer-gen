    "intro": "Leucophyllum ambiguum, commonly known as the Texas snowscale, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for native gardens and landscapes."
