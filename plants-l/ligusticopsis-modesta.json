    "intro": "Ligusticopsis modesta, commonly known as the modest ligustic, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
