    "intro": "Leptospermum polyanthum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and it has a distinctive aromatic scent. Leptospermum polyanthum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
