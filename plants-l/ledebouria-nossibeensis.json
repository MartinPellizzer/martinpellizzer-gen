    "intro": "Ledebouria nossibeensis, commonly known as the Nossibe bulbous lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
