    "intro": "Liparis confusa var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for nutrient absorption from the air and rainwater, typical of orchid biology. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
