    "intro": "Liriope graminifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf liriope, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and form dense clumps. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping. This variety is more compact than the standard Liriope graminifolia, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
