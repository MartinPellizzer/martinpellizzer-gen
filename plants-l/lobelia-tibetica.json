    "intro": "Lobelia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Lobelia tibetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
