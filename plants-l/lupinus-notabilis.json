    "intro": "Lupinus notabilis, commonly known as the showy lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue or purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus notabilis is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
