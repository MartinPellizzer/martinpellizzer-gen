    "intro": "Leucopogon trichocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in open woodlands and sandy areas. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat."
