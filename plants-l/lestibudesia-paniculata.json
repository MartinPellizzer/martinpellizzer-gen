    "intro": "Lestibudesia paniculata, commonly known as the panicled lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Lestibudesia paniculata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
