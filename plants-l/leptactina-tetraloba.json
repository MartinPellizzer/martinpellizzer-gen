    "intro": "Leptactina tetraloba, commonly known as the four-lobed milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which contains latex, is a notable feature and can be toxic if ingested. Leptactina tetraloba plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects."
