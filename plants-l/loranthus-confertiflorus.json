    "intro": "Loranthus confertiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a leathery texture, adapting to its parasitic lifestyle. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
