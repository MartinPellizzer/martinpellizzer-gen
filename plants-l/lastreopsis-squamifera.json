    "intro": "Lastreopsis squamifera, commonly known as the silver scale lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its gray to gray-green thallus covered with a layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
