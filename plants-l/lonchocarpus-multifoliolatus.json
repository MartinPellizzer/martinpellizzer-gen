It is characterized by its compound leaves, which can have multiple leaflets, giving it a lush, foliage-dense appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
