    "intro": "Lindsaea anogrammoides, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce numerous small, lanceolate leaves. The fronds are typically dichotomously branched and have a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in its native habitats."
