    "intro": "Leptoseris saxatilis, commonly known as the rock coral or staghorn coral, is a species of staghorn coral native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a colonial coral that forms branching structures, resembling a tree or antlers, which provide habitat for various marine organisms. The coral's skeleton is composed of calcium carbonate, and it exhibits a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae algae, which contribute to its vibrant coloration. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found on rocky substrates. Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a key species in coral reef ecosystems."
