    "intro": "Leucochrysum alpinum, commonly known as alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is perennial, typically growing to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with silver-gray foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots and creeping growth habit make it well adapted to rocky and alpine environments. Leucochrysum alpinum is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, dried flowers."
