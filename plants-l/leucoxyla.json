    "intro": "Leucoxyla, commonly known as the satinwood or satin tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. These trees are characterized by their smooth, often waxy bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy. The flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in drooping clusters, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Leucoxyla species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
