    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. tristachyum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its spore-bearing cones and foliage resembling small club-like structures. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to various regions in North America, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporophylls that enclose the spores, which are released during the dry season. It has a unique reproductive system that involves both sexual and asexual propagation, making it an important species in ecological studies. Its structure and growth habits reflect adaptations to its woodland habitat, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
