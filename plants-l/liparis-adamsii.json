    "intro": "Liparis adamsii, commonly known as Adams' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant features a slender, rhizomatous stem and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, contributing to its ability to blend into its natural habitat. Liparis adamsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
