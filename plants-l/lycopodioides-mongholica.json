    "intro": "Lycopodioides mongholica, commonly known as the Mongolian clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves, typical of primitive ferns. Native to the arid regions of Inner Mongolia, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its reproductive structures are crucial for its survival in low-nutrient environments. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Lycopodioides mongholica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
