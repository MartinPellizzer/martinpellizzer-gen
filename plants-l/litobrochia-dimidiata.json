    "intro": "Litobrochia dimidiata, commonly known as the two-lobed brochidium, is a small, annual plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, known for its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically from late autumn to early spring. Its leaves are often divided into two distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. Litobrochia dimidiata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves."
