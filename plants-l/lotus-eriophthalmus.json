    "intro": "Lotus eriophthalmus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
