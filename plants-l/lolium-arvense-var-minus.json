    "intro": "Lolium arvense var. minus, commonly known as narrowleaf ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
