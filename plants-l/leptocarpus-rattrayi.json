    "intro": "Leptocarpus rattrayi, commonly known as the Rattray's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of clustered bracts that protect the small, showy flowers. This species is often found in mangrove ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
