    "intro": "Lamanonia chabertii, commonly known as the Chabert's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Lamanonia chabertii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
