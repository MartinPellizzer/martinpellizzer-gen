    "intro": "Loranthus kraussianus var. puberulus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. This species is native to southern Africa and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats."
