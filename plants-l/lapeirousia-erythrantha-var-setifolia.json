    "intro": "Lapeirousia erythrantha var. setifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered bulbous orchid, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces underground bulbs that store nutrients for the flowering season. Native to the Western and Northern Cape provinces, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected in its natural habitat."
