    "intro": "Lotus aegyptiacus, commonly known as the Egyptian lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the Nile River basin. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender stems that support its striking pink or red flowers. The plant blooms during the summer months, producing showy flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and it is also valued for its ornamental beauty. The Egyptian lotus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life."
