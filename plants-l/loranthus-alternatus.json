    "intro": "Loranthus alternatus, commonly known as the alternate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds in return. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for certain bird species. Its growth is often limited to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked."
