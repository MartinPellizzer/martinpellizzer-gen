    "intro": "Lappula stricta var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent silique that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. The smooth lappula is notable for its simple, unbranched stems and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
