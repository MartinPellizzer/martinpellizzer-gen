It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically green and lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, round fruits similar to tomatoes. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Solanaceae family."
