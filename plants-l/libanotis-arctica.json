    "intro": "Libanotis arctica, commonly known as the arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Libanotis arctica plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
