    "intro": "Lotononis alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine lotononis, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
