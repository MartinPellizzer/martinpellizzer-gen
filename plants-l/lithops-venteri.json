    "intro": "Lithops venteri, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. Lithops venteri is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
