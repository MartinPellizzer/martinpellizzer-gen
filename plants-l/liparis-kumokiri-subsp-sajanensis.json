    "intro": "Liparis kumokiri subsp. sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan mountain orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, forested areas with moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single, upright spike of flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
