    "intro": "Liparis fujisanensis, commonly known as the Fujisan orchid, is a rare and delicate terrestrial orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in the high-altitude regions of Mount Fuji. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
