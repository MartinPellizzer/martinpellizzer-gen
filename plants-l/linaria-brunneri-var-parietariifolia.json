    "intro": "Linaria brunneri var. parietariifolia, commonly known as the wallflower or sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
