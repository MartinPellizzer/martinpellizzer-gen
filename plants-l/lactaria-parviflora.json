    "intro": "Lactaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milk cap, is a species of bolete mushroom found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored cap and a white, milky latex that exudes when the stem is broken. The mushroom typically grows in association with coniferous and broadleaf trees, often in forested areas. Its fruiting bodies appear from late summer to early autumn, and it is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North America. The species is noted for its edible qualities, though it is sometimes confused with more toxic look-alikes."
