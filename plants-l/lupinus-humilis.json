    "intro": "Lupinus humilis, commonly known as the low lupine, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features upright stems with clusters of spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
