It features thick, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color, adorned with dense, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a shallow root system and water-storing tissues.
