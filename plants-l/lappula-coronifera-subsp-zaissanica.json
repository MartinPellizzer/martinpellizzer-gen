It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
