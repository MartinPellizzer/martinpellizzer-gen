    "intro": "Ligularia kanaitzensis var. kanaitzensis, commonly known as the Kanaitz Mountain Ligularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
