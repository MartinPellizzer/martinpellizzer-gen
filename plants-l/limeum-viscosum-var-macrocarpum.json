    "intro": "Limeum viscosum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited sticky lime, is a variant of the sticky lime plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps protect it from herbivores. The plant produces large, yellowish-green fruits that are edible and have a tangy flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
