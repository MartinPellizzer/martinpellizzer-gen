    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. carnosus, commonly known as the woolly bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that resemble a bird's foot. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and ecological restoration projects."
