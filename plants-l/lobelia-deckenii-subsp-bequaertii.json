    "intro": "Lobelia deckenii subsp. bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
