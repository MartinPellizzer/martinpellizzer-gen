    "intro": "Limonium biflorum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and coastal environments, making it well adapted to harsh, maritime conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Limonium biflorum is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
