    "intro": "Ligustrum sempervirens, commonly known as evergreen privet, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It has a fast growth rate and is often used as a hedge or privacy screen due to its hardiness and adaptability. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
