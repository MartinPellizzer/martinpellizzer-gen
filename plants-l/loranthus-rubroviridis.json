    "intro": "Loranthus rubroviridis, commonly known as the red-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own sugars through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing adhesive seeds that help in dispersal by sticking to birds or animals. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife."
