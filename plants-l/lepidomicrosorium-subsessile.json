    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium subsessile, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a delicate aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves. Lepidomicrosorium subsessile plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
