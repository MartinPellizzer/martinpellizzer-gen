    "intro": "Lindsaea repens f. minor, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are typically linear to ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged in a dense, carpet-like formation. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, facilitating spore dispersal."
