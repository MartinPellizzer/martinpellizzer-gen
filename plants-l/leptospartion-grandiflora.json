It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
