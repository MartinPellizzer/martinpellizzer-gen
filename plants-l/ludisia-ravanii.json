It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful foliage rather than showy flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad, waxy, and come in shades of green, red, and purple, making it a popular ornamental plant. Ludisia ravanii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
