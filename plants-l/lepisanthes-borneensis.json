    "intro": "Lepisanthes borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean lepisanthes, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of the tropical rainforest. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by insects. Lepisanthes borneensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
