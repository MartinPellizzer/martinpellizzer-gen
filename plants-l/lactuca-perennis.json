    "intro": "Lactuca perennis, commonly known as everlasting lettuce, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, dark green, wavy-edged leaves and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Lactuca. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine make it a notable botanical species."
