    "intro": "Laguncularia pedicellata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its aerial roots, which help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils. Its small, elliptical leaves are typically opposite and have a glossy green appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
