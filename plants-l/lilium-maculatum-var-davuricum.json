It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with red or purple spots on the outer petals. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern around the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking appearance and relatively easy cultivation requirements."
