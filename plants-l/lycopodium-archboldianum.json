    "intro": "Lycopodium archboldianum, commonly known as the Archbold's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
