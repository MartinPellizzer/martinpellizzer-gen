    "intro": "Lithops localis, commonly known as the \"dune lithops,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with two fleshy leaves that resemble stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. Lithops localis is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
