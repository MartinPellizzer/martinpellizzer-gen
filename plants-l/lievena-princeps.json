    "intro": "Lievena princeps, commonly known as the royal lievena, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, waxy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with intricate patterns. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, often covered in a fine, silvery hair that helps reflect sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lievena princeps is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
