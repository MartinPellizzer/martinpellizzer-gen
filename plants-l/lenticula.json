    "intro": "Lenticula, commonly known as the \"lens-shaped\" structure on some plants, refers to a small, raised area on the stem or trunk. It is often associated with the presence of lenticels, which are tiny pores that allow gas exchange in woody plants. These structures are crucial for the respiration of the plant, especially in the bark of trees and shrubs. Lenticulae are typically found on the surface of stems and roots, and their size and number vary among different species. They play an important role in the overall health and survival of the plant by facilitating the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide."
