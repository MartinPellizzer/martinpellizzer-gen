It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by distinctive, curled fruiting bodies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lasiocarpus ferrugineus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
