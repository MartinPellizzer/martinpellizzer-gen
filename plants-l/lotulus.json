    "intro": "Lotulus, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, often with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The flowers of Lotulus species can be either white, yellow, or pink, and they open during the day, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. These plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
