    "intro": "Linaria calycina, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, linear leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces seed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Linaria calycina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
