It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized environment, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
