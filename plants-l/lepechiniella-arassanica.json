    "intro": "Lepechiniella arassanica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, ascending stems with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Lepechiniella arassanica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
