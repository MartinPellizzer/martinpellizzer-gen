    "intro": "Limnanthes douglasii subsp. ornduffii, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
