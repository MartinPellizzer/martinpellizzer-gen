    "intro": "Lamourouxia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific lamourouxia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and along rocky shores. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
