    "intro": "Lycopodium engleri, commonly known as the Engler's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, branching stem structure. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, a feature typical of primitive vascular plants. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
