    "intro": "Luzula racemosa f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf wood rush, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to yellowish flowers, which are often clustered near the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks, and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Luzula racemosa f. humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect and fungal populations."
