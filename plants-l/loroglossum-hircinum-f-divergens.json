    "intro": "Loroglossum hircinum f. divergens, commonly known as the divergent horned orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, horn-like petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this orchid is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
