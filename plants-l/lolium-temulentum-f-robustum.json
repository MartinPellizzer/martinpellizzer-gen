It is characterized by its robust growth habit and dense, upright stems. The plant typically produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. This form is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
