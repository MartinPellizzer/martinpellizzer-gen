    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium emeicola, commonly known as the emeicola water fern, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
