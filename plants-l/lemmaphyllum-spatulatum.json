    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum spatulatum, commonly known as the spoonleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It features a dense, leathery thallus with a greenish or yellowish hue, often covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungal component and algae or cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic ability. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
