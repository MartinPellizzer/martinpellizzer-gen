It is native to Australia and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
