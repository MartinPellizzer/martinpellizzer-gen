    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare pendulum, commonly known as the weeping privet, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, making it popular in landscaping for hedges and topiaries. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Ligustrum vulgare pendulum thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low-maintenance, though it can become invasive in some regions."
