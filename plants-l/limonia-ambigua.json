    "intro": "Limonia ambigua, commonly known as the white lime or white limes, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that produces fragrant, white flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing near the coast where it tolerates salt spray. Limonia ambigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
