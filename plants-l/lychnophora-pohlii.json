It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic species in certain regions."
