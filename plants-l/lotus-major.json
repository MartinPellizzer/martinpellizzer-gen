    "intro": "Lotus major, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stems. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the muddy bottom. Lotus major is known for its symbolic significance in various cultures and its use in traditional medicine and cuisine. Its unique ability to bloom with its petals fully open in the morning sun has made it a subject of admiration and spiritual reflection."
