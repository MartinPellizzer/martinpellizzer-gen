    "intro": "Lathyrus pratensis var. binatus, commonly known as the twin-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that often appear in pairs, giving it its varietal name \"binatus.\" The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and has a fibrous root system. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
