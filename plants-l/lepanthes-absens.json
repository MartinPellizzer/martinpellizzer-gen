    "intro": "Lepanthes absens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. This epiphytic plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of ghostly forms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lepanthes absens is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
