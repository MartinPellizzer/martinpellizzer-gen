    "intro": "Lomatia dentata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf lomatia, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features distinctive, lobed leaves that are typically smooth-edged, differing from the more sharply toothed leaves of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in spring. Its woody stems are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a unique appearance. This variety is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
