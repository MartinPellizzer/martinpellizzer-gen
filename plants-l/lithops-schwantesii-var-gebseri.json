    "intro": "Lithops schwantesii var. gebseri, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with fleshy, paired leaves that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique morphology helps it blend into its surroundings, providing camouflage from herbivores."
