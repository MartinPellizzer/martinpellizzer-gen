    "intro": "Laserpitium gallicum var. formosum, commonly known as the French larkspur, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic to livestock and humans if ingested."
