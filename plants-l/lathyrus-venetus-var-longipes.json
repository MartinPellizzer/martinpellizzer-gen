    "intro": "Lathyrus venetus var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used as a food source for birds and small mammals. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
