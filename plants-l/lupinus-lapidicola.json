    "intro": "Lupinus lapidicola, commonly known as the stone lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Lupinus lapidicola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
