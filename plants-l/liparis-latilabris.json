It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a broad, lip-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
