    "intro": "Lappula texana var. columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia lappula, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, with a hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss. The Columbia lappula is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
