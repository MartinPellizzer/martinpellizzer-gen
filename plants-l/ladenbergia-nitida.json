It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in racemes. The seeds are enclosed in narrow, slender pods, which contribute to its common name."
