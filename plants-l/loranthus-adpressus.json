    "intro": "Loranthus adpressus, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to reduced growth and vitality in the host tree. Loranthus adpressus is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
