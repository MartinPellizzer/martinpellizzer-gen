    "intro": "Loranthus orbicularis, commonly known as the globe mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are red and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating propagation. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and forested areas."
