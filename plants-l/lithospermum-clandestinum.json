    "intro": "Lithospermum clandestinum, commonly known as the secret rock pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, violet to blue flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
