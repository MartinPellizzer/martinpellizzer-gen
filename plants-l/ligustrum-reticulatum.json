    "intro": "Ligustrum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southeastern Asia. It features small, opposite leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. Ligustrum reticulatum is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
