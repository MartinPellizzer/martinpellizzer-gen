    "intro": "Lithops koelemanii, commonly known as the \"Cape Town Flower,\" is a member of the Aizoaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a succulent plant with a unique appearance, featuring two fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, which are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. Lithops koelemanii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
