It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, white coating. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
