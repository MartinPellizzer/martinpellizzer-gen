    "intro": "Liparis cespitosa, commonly known as the tufted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and possesses a network of rhizomes that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern, and are covered with a fine, waxy coating. Liparis cespitosa is often found in humid, forested areas and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
