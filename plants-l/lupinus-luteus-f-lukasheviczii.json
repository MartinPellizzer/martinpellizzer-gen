    "intro": "Lupinus luteus f. lukasheviczii, commonly known as the yellow lupine form, is a botanical variant of the yellow lupine species. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and typically smaller stature compared to the standard species. This form is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and role in ecological studies of plant adaptation."
