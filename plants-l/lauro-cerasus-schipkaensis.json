It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible, red berries that are similar to cherries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
