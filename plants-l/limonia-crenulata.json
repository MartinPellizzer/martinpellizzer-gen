    "intro": "Limonia crenulata, commonly known as the sour orange, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is typically small, round, and has a thick, leathery skin with a sour taste, though it is not typically eaten raw. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. The plant is also valued for its historical use in citrus cultivation and as a rootstock for other citrus plants."
