    "intro": "Leontice, commonly known as false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Leontice tenuis and Leontice alpina, which are native to Europe and parts of Asia. These plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and produce a capsule fruit containing numerous seeds. Leontice species are often found in moist, calcareous soils and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
