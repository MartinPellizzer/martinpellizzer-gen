It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant features hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent. Its flowering stems produce small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Ligusticum cynapifolium is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
