    "intro": "Luzuriaga sewelliae, commonly known as the Stewart's wintergreen, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Luzuriaga sewelliae thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with poor soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
