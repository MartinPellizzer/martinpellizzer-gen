    "intro": "Lobivia huascha var. robusta, commonly known as the Huascha Lobivia, is a succulent native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is drought-tolerant and can store water in its stems, making it suitable for arid environments. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking contrast to its foliage."
