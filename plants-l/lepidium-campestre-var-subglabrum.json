It features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically lobed or divided. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its smooth, glabrous surfaces and its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
