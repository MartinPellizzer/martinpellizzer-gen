    "intro": "Lacunaria coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved lacunaria, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Lacunaria coriacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
