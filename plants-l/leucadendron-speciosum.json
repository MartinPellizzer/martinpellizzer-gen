It is characterized by its silvery-gray, flaky bark and dense, rounded foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow or orange spherical flower heads during the winter months, which are a key feature for identification. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its unique aesthetic and resilience."
