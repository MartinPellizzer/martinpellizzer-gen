It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features dense clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. It produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its foliage, which are characteristic of the Lycopodiaceae family. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained conditions."
