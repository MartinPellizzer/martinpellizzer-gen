    "intro": "Lepisorus obscure-venulosus, commonly known as the dark-veined forest fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, darkly veined appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and covered with a thin layer of brownish scales. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, shaded habitats."
