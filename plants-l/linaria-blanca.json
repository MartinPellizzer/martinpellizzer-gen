It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with two lips that resemble the shape of a toad's mouth, giving it its common name. Linaria blanca thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
