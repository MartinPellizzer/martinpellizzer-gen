It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and seasonal flowering, which add visual interest to garden landscapes."
