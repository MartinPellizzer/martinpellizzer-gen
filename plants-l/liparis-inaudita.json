    "intro": "Liparis inaudita, commonly known as the silent orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its flowers are typically clustered in a loose raceme, and the species is noted for its unusual lack of a strong fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Liparis inaudita is considered endangered in its natural range."
