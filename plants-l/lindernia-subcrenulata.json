    "intro": "Lindernia subcrenulata, commonly known as the silverleaf lindernia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Lindernia subcrenulata is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
