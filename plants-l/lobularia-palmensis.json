    "intro": "Lobularia palmensis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in sandy soils. Lobularia palmensis is often found in disturbed soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
