It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are essential for its reproduction. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, forming dense clusters around the central stem. Lycopodium bolivianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
