    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. lappotornensis, commonly known as the Lappotornensis twinflower, is a rare botanical variant of the twinflower plant native to northern Scandinavia. It is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forest understories. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces red berries in the fall. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic traits and limited distribution."
