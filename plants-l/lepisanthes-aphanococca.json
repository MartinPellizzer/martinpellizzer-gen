    "intro": "Lepisanthes aphanococca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green or white flowers that resemble translucent leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, clustered roots that anchor it to its host and absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
