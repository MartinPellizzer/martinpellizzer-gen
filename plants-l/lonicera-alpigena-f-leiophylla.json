    "intro": "Lonicera alpigena f. leiophylla, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
