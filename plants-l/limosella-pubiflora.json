    "intro": "Limosella pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy sandspoon, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Europe. It is a member of the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Limosella pubiflora is an annual herb that plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
