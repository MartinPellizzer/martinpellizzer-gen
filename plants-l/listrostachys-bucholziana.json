    "intro": "Listrostachys bucholziana, commonly known as the Bucholz's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance for pollinators, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes."
