    "intro": "Lappa palladinii, commonly known as the Palladian hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbels. The plant contains phototoxic chemicals in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near roadsides or in wet meadows. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
