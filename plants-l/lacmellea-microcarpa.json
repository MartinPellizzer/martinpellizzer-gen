    "intro": "Lacmellea microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf star moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-like thallus structure. The plant has a low-growing habit with a dense, cushion-like appearance, often carpeting the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in small clusters on the thallus surface. Lacmellea microcarpa thrives in cool, humid climates and is often used as an indicator species for undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils."
