    "intro": "Lobelia thomensis, commonly known as the Tom\u00e9 Islands lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o in the Cape Verde archipelago. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has small, narrow leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
