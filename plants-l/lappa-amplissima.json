    "intro": "Lappa amplissima, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces large, umbrella-like clusters of small white flowers, which are followed by green, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near rivers and roadsides. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can pose a danger to humans and animals."
