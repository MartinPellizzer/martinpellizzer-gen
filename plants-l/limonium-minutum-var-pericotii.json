    "intro": "Limonium minutum var. pericotii, commonly known as the Pericotti's sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for coastal gardens. The variety is named after the botanist Jos\u00e9 Peric\u00f3, who contributed significantly to the study of Mediterranean flora."
