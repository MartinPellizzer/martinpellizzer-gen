    "intro": "Lumnitzera capitata, commonly known as mangrove apple, is a halophytic plant that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its unique aerial roots, which help in gas exchange and stabilization in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal by water and animals. Lumnitzera capitata plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
