It is characterized by its translucent exoskeleton that often appears reddish or copper-colored due to pigmentation. This species is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Limnia cuprea plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as a primary food source for larger organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and a healthy ecosystem."
