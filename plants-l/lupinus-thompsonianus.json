    "intro": "Lupinus thompsonianus, commonly known as the Thompson's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Lupinus thompsonianus plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
