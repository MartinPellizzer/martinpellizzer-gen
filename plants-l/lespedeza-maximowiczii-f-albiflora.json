    "intro": "Lespedeza maximowiczii f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. It is often found in moist soils in woodland or open areas, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
