    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum subsp. flabelliforme, commonly known as the flat-leaf clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations. This subspecies is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like foliage, which distinguishes it from other members of the Lycopodium genus."
