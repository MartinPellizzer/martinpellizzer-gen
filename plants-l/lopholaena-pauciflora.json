    "intro": "Lopholaena pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered lopholaena, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and features simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Lopholaena pauciflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
