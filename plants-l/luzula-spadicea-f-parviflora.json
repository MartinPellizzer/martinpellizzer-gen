    "intro": "Luzula spadicea f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered woodrush, is a variant of the woodrush genus native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb with grass-like foliage, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically clustered in short, compact clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense mats. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
