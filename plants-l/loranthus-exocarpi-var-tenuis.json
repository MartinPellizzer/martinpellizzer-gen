    "intro": "Loranthus exocarpi var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found on hosts such as Ficus and Mangifera species. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and are arranged in clusters, while its berries are small and fleshy, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
