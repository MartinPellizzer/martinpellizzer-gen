    "intro": "Lorentea gracilis, commonly known as the slender loranth, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It typically attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Eucalyptus, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it relies heavily on its host for survival. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host tree."
