    "intro": "Lonicera subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically narrow and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are usually yellow or white in color. Its berries are red and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed as those of other honeysuckle species. Lonicera subsessilis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
