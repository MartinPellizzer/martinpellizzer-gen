    "intro": "Leutea petiolaris, commonly known as the slender leaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves and chlorophyll. It attaches itself to host plants, primarily those in the legume family, through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species is found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
