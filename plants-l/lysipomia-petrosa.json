    "intro": "Lysipomia petrosa, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, edible tubers that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Lysipomia petrosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in high-altitude ecosystems."
