    "intro": "Ligusticum catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalan lovage, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels. Its rhizomes and roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum catalaunicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
