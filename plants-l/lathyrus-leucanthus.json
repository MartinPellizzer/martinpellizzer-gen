    "intro": "Lathyrus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces elliptical, hairy pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can improve soil fertility in agricultural settings."
