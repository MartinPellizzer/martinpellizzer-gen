    "intro": "Lepanthes aberrans, commonly known as the variable nightshade orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom at night, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually elongated and dark green, adapted to capture limited light. Lepanthes aberrans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
