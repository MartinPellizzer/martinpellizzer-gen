    "intro": "Lotus glaucus var. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged, while its stems are flexible and adapted to aquatic environments. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. The lotus is also notable for its ability to purify water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
