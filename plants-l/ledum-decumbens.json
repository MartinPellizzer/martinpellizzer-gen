    "intro": "Ledum decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate laburnum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to permafrost conditions. Ledum decumbens is also known for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds with medicinal properties."
