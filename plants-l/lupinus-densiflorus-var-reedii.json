    "intro": "Lupinus densiflorus var. reedii, commonly known as Reed's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in nutrient-poor soils. As a member of the legume family, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
