    "intro": "Luziola peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to its arid habitat. Luziola peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
