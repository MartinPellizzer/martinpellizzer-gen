    "intro": "Lannea grossularia, commonly known as the African starfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green fruits that resemble starfruits. The plant belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other fruit-bearing species like mango and cashew. Its fruit, while not as commonly consumed as other starfruits, is edible and has a tangy, slightly acidic flavor. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
