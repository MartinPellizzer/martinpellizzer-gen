It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found growing along sandy shores or in brackish water areas. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds.
