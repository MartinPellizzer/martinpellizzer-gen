    "intro": "Lobelia longipilosa, commonly known as the long-haired lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, particularly along the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lobelia longipilosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
