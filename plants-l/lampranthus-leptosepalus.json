It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in late winter to early spring. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a striking addition to succulent collections."
