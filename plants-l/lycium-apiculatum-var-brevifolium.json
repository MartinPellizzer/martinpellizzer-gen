    "intro": "Lycium apiculatum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features dense, spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with low water availability and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient plant suitable for landscaping in drought-prone areas."
