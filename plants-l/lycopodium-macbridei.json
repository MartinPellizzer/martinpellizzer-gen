    "intro": "Lycopodium macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind, a common reproductive strategy among primitive vascular plants. Lycopodium macbridei is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
