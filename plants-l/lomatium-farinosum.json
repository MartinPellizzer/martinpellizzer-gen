    "intro": "Lomatium farinosum, commonly known as the farina lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Lomatium farinosum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
