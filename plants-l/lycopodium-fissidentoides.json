It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium fissidentoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
