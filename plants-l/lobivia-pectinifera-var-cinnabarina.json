It features cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in dense, woolly white or pale blue hairs. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
