    "intro": "Lithocardium macleodii, commonly known as the Macleod's lithocardium, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small, herbaceous plant with simple, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, often displaying a pale pink to white coloration. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
