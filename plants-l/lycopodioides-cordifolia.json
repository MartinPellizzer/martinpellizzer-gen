    "intro": "Lycopodioides cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stem. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides cordifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
