    "intro": "Loncomelos insulare, commonly known as the island loncomelos, is a rare flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its island home. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
