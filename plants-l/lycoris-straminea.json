    "intro": "Lycoris straminea, commonly known as the white spider lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. Its bulbs are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it important to handle with care. Lycoris straminea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
