    "intro": "Limonium recticaule, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, spindly stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Limonium recticaule is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal gardens."
