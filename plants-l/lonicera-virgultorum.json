    "intro": "Lonicera virgultorum, commonly known as sweetwood or American honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent beneath, and it produces fragrant, tubular flowers in the spring. The plant's floral structure is adapted for pollination by both bees and hummingbirds, with its nectar-rich blossoms appearing in shades of yellow and orange. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall, providing food for various wildlife species. Lonicera virgultorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in gardens and natural habitats."
