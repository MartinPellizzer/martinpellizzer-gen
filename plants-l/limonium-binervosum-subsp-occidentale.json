    "intro": "Limonium binervosum subsp. occidentale, commonly known as the western sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and showy, blue to violet flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. This subspecies is part of the Plumbagaceae family, which includes other coastal and Mediterranean plants."
