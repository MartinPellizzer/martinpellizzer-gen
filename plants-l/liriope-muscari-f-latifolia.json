    "intro": "Liriope muscari f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf woodland lily, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It features grass-like leaves that are broader and more robust than those of the typical Liriope muscari, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or shaded gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
