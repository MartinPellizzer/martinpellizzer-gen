    "intro": "Loranthus woodfordioides, commonly known as the Woodford's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to Australia and is often found in regions with a temperate climate."
