    "intro": "Lastrea recumbens, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
