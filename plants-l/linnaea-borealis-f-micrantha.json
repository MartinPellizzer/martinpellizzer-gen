    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in pairs at the ends of the stems. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
