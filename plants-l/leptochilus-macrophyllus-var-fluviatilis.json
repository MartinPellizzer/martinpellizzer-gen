    "intro": "Leptochilus macrophyllus var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the river water shield, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, blooming in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water areas. This variety is often found in slow-moving rivers, ponds, and marshes, where it plays a role in water filtration and ecosystem support."
