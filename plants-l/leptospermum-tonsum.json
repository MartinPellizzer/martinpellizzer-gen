    "intro": "Leptospermum tonsum, commonly known as the Tasmanian tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Tasmania. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to the cool, wet climate of its native habitat and is often found in damp, shaded areas. The species is notable for its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
