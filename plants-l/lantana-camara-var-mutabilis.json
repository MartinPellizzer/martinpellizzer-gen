    "intro": "Lantana camara var. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its showy clusters of small, tubular flowers that change color as they age, typically ranging from yellow to orange to red. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
