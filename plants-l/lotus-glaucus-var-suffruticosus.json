It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact, shrub-like form makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
