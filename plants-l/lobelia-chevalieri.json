    "intro": "Lobelia chevalieri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Lobelia chevalieri is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations above 9,000 feet."
