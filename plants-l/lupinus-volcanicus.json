    "intro": "Lupinus volcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic lupin, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus volcanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
