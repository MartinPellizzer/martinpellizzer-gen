    "intro": "Limonium tetragonum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt tolerance makes it a valuable plant for coastal restoration and landscaping. Limonium tetragonum is also used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments."
