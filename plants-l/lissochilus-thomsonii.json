It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
