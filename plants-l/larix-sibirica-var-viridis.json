    "intro": "Larix sibirica var. viridis, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a variant of the Siberian larch species native to eastern Asia. It is a coniferous tree characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically green and remain on the tree for several years. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
