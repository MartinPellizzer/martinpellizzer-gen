    "intro": "Lorenzanea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is native to regions in South America and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
