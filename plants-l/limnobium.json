    "intro": "Limnobium, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeraliaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Limnobium species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the substrate, while their leaves float on the water surface. The flowers attract pollinators like beetles and bees, playing a vital role in the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems."
