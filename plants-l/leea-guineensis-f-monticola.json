    "intro": "Leea guineensis f. monticola, commonly known as the mountain leea, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Leeaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by smooth, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of West Africa. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
