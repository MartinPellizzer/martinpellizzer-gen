    "intro": "Lagarinthus involucratus, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most striking feature is its clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Lagarinthus involucratus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
