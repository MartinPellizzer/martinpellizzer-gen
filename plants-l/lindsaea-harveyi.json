    "intro": "Lindsaea harveyi, commonly known as Harvey's spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of its branches. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Lindsaea harveyi plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
