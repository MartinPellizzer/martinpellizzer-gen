    "intro": "Loudetiopsis pobeguinii, commonly known as the coastal dwarf lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its dense, foliose growth form and a distinctive yellowish-green coloration. This lichen is typically found on rock surfaces in humid, maritime climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
