    "intro": "Liliacum, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Acoraceae and is characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and a distinctive, aromatic underground rhizome. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in dense clusters. Its rhizome is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Liliacum thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks."
