    "intro": "Lepanthes meniskos, commonly known as the Meniskos orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or greenish, are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths."
