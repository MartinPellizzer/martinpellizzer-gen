    "intro": "Lespedeza tricolor, commonly known as purpletop vervain, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy purple and white flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Lespedeza tricolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and role in supporting pollinators."
