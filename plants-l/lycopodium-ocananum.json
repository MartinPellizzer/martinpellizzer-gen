    "intro": "Lycopodium ocananum, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of spore-bearing strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its compact, club-like appearance. Lycopodium ocananum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
