    "intro": "Limnanthes bellingeriana, commonly known as the bellflower or golden cupflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to California. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces small, cup-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Limnanthes bellingeriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in sandy soils."
