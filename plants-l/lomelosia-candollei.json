    "intro": "Lomelosia candollei, commonly known as the Canelosia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Lomelosia candollei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
