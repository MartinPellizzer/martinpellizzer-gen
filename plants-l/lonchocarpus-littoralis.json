    "intro": "Lonchocarpus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal senna, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic inundation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
