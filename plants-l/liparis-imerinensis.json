    "intro": "Liparis imerinensis, commonly known as the Imryana orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its roots are fibrous, and it produces small, lance-shaped leaves that help it survive in its alpine setting. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis imerinensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
