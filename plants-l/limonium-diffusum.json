    "intro": "Limonium diffusum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking spikes of blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in salty conditions. Limonium diffusum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging coastal climates."
