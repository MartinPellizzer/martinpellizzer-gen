    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacum var. laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its finely dissected, lobed leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces a single, upright stem topped with a spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, followed by the characteristic seed dispersal mechanism. The species is noted for its adaptability and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
