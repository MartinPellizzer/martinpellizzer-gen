    "intro": "Linum marojejyense, commonly known as the Marojejy flax, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern region of Madagascar. It belongs to the Linaceae family, which includes other flax species known for their fibrous stems. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Linum marojejyense is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
