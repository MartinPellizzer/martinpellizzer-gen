    "intro": "Lotus hemorroidalis, commonly known as the purple lotus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple petals and heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its flowers bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. The lotus is also notable for its ability to purify water and support diverse aquatic life."
