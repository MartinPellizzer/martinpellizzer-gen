    "intro": "Loranthus cleghornii, commonly known as the Cleghorn's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in short racemes. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus cleghornii is native to Australia and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
