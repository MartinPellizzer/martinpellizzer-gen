    "intro": "Leucanthemum balsamita, commonly known as balsam weed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in prairies, roadsides, and other open areas. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Balsam weed is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
