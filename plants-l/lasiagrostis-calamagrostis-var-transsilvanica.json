    "intro": "Lasiagrostis calamagrostis var. transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe, particularly found in Romania and Hungary. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-gray in color. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
