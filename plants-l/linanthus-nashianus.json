    "intro": "Linanthus nashianus, commonly known as Nash's linanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
