    "intro": "Lycopodiella bigelowii, commonly known as the Bigelow's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves that form dense mats, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodiella bigelowii is an important component of the understory vegetation in coniferous forests."
