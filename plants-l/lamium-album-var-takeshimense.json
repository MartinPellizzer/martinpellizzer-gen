    "intro": "Lamium album var. takeshimense, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its scientific name reflects its close relation to the common dead-nettle species, Lamium album."
