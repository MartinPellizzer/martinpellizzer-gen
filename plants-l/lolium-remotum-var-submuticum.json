    "intro": "Lolium remotum var. submuticum, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, somewhat erect growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is an important forage plant for livestock and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
