    "intro": "Lycaste farinosa, commonly known as the powdered lycaste, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and hairy, grayish-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and fragrance."
