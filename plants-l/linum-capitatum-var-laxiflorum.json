    "intro": "Linum capitatum var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorous flax, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, blue or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in meadows and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, clustered blooms and its historical use in textile production."
