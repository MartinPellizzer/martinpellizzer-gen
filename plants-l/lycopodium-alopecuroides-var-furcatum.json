    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides var. furcatum, commonly known as the forked clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
