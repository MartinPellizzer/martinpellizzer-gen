It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a clumping growth habit. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
