    "intro": "Lindernia quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lindernia quinqueloba is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
