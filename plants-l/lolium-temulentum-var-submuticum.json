    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. submuticum, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its softer, more delicate foliage compared to other forms of Lolium temulentum."
