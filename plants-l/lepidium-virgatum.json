    "intro": "Lepidium virgatum, commonly known as field pennycress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features alternate, pinnately compound leaves with small, lobed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by kidney-shaped, edible seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Lepidium virgatum is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
