    "intro": "Lupinus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping lupine, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and possesses a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus stolonifer is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed sites. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
