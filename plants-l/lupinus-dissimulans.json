    "intro": "Lupinus dissimulans, commonly known as the hidden lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features pinnately compound leaves and produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Lupinus dissimulans plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
