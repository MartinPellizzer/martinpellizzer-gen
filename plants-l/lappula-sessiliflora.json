    "intro": "Lappula sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae, which includes many salt-tolerant species. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. It is a herbaceous annual that plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and adaptability."
