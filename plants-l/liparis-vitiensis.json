    "intro": "Liparis vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific, particularly Vanuatu. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive inflorescence that bears multiple fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The orchid's flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
