    "intro": "Lolium temulentum f. leve, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a variant of the annual ryegrass species. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in a single row along the stem, with lemmas that are often hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This form is less commonly cultivated than other ryegrass varieties but is still used in some forage systems."
