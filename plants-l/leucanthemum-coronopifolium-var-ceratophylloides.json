    "intro": "Leucanthemum coronopifolium var. ceratophylloides, commonly known as the white wood aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features showy white to pale yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of yellow tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
