It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit, with large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of branches. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
