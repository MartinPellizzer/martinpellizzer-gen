    "intro": "Limonium ifniense, commonly known as the Canary Islands sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found on sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Limonium ifniense is adapted to tolerate saline conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its blooming period typically occurs during the summer months, adding a splash of color to the island's coastal flora."
