    "intro": "Lastrea multiflora, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
