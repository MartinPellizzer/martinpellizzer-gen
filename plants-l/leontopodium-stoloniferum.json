    "intro": "Leontopodium stoloniferum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in rocky, high-altitude environments where it forms a cushion-like structure to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming colonies that help stabilize soil in its arid habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is also a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
