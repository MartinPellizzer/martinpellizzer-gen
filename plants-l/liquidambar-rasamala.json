    "intro": "Liquidambar rasamala, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its sap, known as liquidambar, has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
