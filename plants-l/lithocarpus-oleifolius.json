    "intro": "Lithocarpus oleifolius, commonly known as the oil-leaf stone oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical and subtropical habitats. Its fruit is a hard, one-seeded nut enclosed in a spiny cupule, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. The tree is valued for its durable wood and is often found in lowland forests, where it plays a significant role in the ecosystem."
