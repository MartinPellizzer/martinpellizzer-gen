    "intro": "Lobelia polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lobelia polyphylla is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
