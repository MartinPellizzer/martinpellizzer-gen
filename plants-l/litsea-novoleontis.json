    "intro": "Litsea novoleontis, commonly known as the Mexican litsea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to southern Mexico and is characterized by its aromatic, small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
