    "intro": "Lodhra obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf white-flowered loquat, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its obovate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by yellowish-orange berries in the summer. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both traditional medicine and ornamental horticulture. The fruit is edible, though often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its high vitamin C content."
