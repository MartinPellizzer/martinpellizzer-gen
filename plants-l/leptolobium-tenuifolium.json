    "intro": "Leptolobium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved leptolobium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
