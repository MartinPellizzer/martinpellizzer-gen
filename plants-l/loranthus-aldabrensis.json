    "intro": "Loranthus aldabrensis, commonly known as the Aldabra mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Comoros Islands. It attaches to its host trees, primarily palms, through specialized roots that extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are dispersed by birds, contain seeds that can germinate on the bark of host trees. This species plays a unique role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
