    "intro": "Lepanthes ekmanii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests, where it thrives on the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepanthes ekmanii is considered a rare and endangered species."
