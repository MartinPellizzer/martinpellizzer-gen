    "intro": "Leptogyne, commonly known as the honeycomb or honey bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plants typically have smooth, sometimes glossy bark and produce small, capsule-like fruits. Leptogyne species are native to Australia and are often found in coastal and sandy habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their hardiness and adaptability."
