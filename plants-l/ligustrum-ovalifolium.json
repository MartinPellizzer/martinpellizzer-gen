    "intro": "Ligustrum ovalifolium, commonly known as the common privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, drupelike berries. It is often used in landscaping for its dense growth and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
