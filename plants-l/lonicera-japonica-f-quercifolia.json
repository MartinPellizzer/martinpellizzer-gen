    "intro": "Lonicera japonica f. quercifolia, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It has a rapid growth rate and is often considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though its ecological impact requires careful management."
