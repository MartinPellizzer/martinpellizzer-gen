It is characterized by its dense, woolly white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a thick layer of white, silky hairs. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often associated with alpine landscapes and is a symbol of resilience and beauty in mountainous regions."
