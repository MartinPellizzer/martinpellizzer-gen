    "intro": "Lycium pachyclados, commonly known as the Turk's cap lycium, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of bright red berries that mature in late summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity."
