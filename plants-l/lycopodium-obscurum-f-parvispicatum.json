    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum f. parvispicatum, commonly known as the small-spored clubmoss, is a fern ally with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered sporophytes. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its spores are produced in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. This form is notable for its compact growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
