It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its blooming period occurs during the summer months, adding a subtle yet elegant touch to its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation."
