    "intro": "Lathyrus crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Lathyrus crassipes is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
