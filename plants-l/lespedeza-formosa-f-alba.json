It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lespedeza formosa f. alba is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
