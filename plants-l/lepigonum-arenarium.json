    "intro": "Lepigonum arenarium, commonly known as sand lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to dry, sandy soils in the United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Lepigonum arenarium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
