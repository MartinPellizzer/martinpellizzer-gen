    "intro": "Laserpitium latifolium subsp. asperum, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, often hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for restoration projects in disturbed soils."
