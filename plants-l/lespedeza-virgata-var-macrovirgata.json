    "intro": "Lespedeza virgata var. macrovirgata, commonly known as the largeflower lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in erosion control and as a forage plant for wildlife."
