    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves with hairy margins, which give it its specific epithet \"ciliatus.\" The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems, including soil stabilization and as a food source for pollinators."
