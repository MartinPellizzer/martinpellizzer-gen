    "intro": "Leucopholis, commonly known as the white-leafed tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its glossy, often white or pale green leaves that reflect light, giving it a striking appearance. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with four to five petals, and they often have a sweet fragrance. Leucopholis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
