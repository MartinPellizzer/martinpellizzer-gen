    "intro": "Leptogramma jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it exhibits a unique reproductive structure compared to other ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
