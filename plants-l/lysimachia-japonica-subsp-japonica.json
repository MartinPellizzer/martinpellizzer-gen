    "intro": "Lysimachia japonica subsp. japonica, commonly known as Japanese yellow waterplantain, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in its native habitat."
