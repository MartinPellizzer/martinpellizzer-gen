    "intro": "Lepidagathis scariosa, commonly known as the scarious lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Lepidagathis scariosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
