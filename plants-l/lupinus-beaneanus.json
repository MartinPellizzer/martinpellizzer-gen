    "intro": "Lupinus beaneanus, commonly known as the Beanean lupine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus beaneanus is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in well-drained, rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
