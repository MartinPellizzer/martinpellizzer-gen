    "intro": "Leptasea tolmiei, commonly known as the Tolmien's arrowhead, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots help stabilize the sediment in water bodies, contributing to aquatic ecosystem health. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
