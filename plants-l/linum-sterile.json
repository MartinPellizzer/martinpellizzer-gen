    "intro": "Linum sterile, commonly known as the common flax, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Linum sterile is often cultivated for its fiber, which is used in the production of linen. However, it is not typically grown for its seeds, as it is sterile and does not produce viable offspring."
