    "intro": "Lewisiopsis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are often lobed or divided, and its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is found in arid or semi-arid regions. Lewisiopsis species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. They play a role in supporting local pollinators and contribute to the biodiversity of their native habitats."
