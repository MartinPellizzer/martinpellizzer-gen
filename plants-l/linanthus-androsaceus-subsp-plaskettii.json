    "intro": "Linanthus androsaceus subsp. plaskettii, commonly known as the Plaskett's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its sprawling habit and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
