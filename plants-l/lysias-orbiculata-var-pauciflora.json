    "intro": "Lysias orbiculata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a vulnerable species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
