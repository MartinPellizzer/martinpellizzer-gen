    "intro": "Lepidobolus quadratus, commonly known as the four-sided lepidobolus, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Lepidobolaceae. It is characterized by its unique quadrilateral or four-sided structure in its vegetative parts, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments with rich organic soil. Its morphology includes a short, thick rhizome with leaf-like structures that are arranged in a distinctive four-sided pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
