    "intro": "Leonis trineura, commonly known as the three-veined leonis, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive leaf structure. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with three prominent veins running from the base to the tip. The plant exhibits a woody stem that becomes more robust with age, often branching out into a shrub-like form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is native to specific regions in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
