    "intro": "Lumnitzera rubicunda, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic species native to the Indo-Pacific region. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has distinctive prop roots that extend from its trunk, providing structural support and facilitating gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by elliptical, red berries that contain the seeds. Lumnitzera rubicunda plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
