    "intro": "Liparis lacus, commonly known as the lake orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in temperate regions with high humidity and moist soil. The plant features a slender, rhizomatous stem that supports its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and moths."
