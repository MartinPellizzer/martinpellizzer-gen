    "intro": "Lophochloa cristata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. One notable feature is its viviparous trait, where some seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This adaptation may enhance its reproductive success in disturbed or nutrient-poor habitats."
