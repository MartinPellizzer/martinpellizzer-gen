    "intro": "Limonium secundirameum, commonly known as the secondary-branched sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to saline environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Limonium secundirameum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
