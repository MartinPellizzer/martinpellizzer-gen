    "intro": "Lepidium membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous cress, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in moist, temperate environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in racemes, and it produces small, rounded fruits called siliques. Lepidium membranaceum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
