    "intro": "Lotus balticus, commonly known as the Baltic lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, contributing to water purification. However, due to habitat loss and pollution, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
