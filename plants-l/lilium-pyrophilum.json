    "intro": "Lilium pyrophilum, commonly known as the fire lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 6 feet in height, adorned with large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a red or orange rim. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or open habitats. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
