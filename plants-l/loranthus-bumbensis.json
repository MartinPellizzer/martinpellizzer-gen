    "intro": "Loranthus bumbensis, commonly known as the Bumbi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia."
