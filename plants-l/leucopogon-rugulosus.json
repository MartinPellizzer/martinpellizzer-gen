    "intro": "Leucopogon rugulosus, commonly known as the rough leucopogon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or acidic soils, often in open woodlands or heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, rough hairs, which give it its common name. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
