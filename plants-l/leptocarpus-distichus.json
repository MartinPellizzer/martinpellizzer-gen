    "intro": "Leptocarpus distichus, commonly known as the two-ranked sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, boat-shaped fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in dune environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
