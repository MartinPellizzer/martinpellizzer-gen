    "intro": "Loxogramme microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water clover, is a aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, rounded lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its fronds are typically green and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Loxogramme microphylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
