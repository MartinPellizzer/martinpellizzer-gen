    "intro": "Liparophyllum congestiflorum, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wet, forested areas and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, cylindrical fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
