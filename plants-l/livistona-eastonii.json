    "intro": "Livistona eastonii, commonly known as the Easton's palm, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, woody capsule that matures over several months. Livistona eastonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
