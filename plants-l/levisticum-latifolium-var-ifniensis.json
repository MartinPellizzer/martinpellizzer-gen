    "intro": "Levisticum latifolium var. ifniensis, commonly known as the Ifni lovage, is a rare and ancient variety of the lovage plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, aromatic leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine for their digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
