    "intro": "Lotus axilliflorus, commonly known as the Indian lotus, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom on long, slender stems. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The lotus is also symbolically significant in many cultures, representing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
