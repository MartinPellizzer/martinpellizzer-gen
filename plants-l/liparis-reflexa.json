    "intro": "Liparis reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, with petals that curve backward, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Liparis reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
