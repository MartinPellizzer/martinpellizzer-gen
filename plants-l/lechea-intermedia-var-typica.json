    "intro": "Lechea intermedia var. typica, commonly known as the typical intermediate lechea, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a distinctive grayish or whitish underside, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
