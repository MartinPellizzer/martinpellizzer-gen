    "intro": "Lithospermum molle, commonly known as soft rock pepper, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lithospermum molle is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing in full sun and well-drained soils. Its roots can form a dense mat, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat."
