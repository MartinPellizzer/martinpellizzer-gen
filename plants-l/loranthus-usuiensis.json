    "intro": "Loranthus usuiensis, commonly known as the Japanese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees. This species is native to Japan and is considered a rare and specialized member of the Loranthaceae family."
