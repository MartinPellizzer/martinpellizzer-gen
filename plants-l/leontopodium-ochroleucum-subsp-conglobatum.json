    "intro": "Leontopodium ochroleucum subsp. conglobatum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, daisy-like flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is often covered in a thick layer of white, fuzzy hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and frost. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions."
