It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
