    "intro": "Lycopodium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Lycopodium sikkimense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
