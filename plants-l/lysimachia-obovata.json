    "intro": "Lysimachia obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf water pepper, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist environments in North America. It features opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in wetlands. Lysimachia obovata is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat skin irritations and as a diuretic."
