    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris subsp. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The subspecies pilosus is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in damp environments. It produces small, lens-shaped legumes that contain the plant's seeds. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in wet areas and provides food for various insects and wildlife."
