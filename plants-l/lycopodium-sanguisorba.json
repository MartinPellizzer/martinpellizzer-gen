    "intro": "Lycopodium sanguisorba, commonly known as bloody ironroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its common name derives from the reddish color of its roots, which were historically used in traditional medicine."
