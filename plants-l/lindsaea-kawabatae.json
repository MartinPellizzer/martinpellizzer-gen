It is native to tropical regions of Asia, particularly found in the Philippines and Indonesia. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on moist, well-drained soil. Its stems are prostrate, with small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Lindsaea kawabatae is characterized by its distinctive spore-bearing structures, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations along the stems."
