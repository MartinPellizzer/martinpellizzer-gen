    "intro": "Lycopodium geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium geniculatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
