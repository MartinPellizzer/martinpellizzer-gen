    "intro": "Leontopodium fischerianum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, white to pale yellow flower heads. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its growth is slow, and it is adapted to cold, harsh climates with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
