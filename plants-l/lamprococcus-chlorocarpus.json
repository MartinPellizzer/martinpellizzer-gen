    "intro": "Lamprococcus chlorocarpus, commonly known as the green fruiting body, is a unique fungal species belonging to the family Lepiota. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow cap and a pale yellow stem, which are covered in fine, silky hairs. The fruiting bodies typically appear in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is considered a saprophytic fungus, decomposing organic matter. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for edible mushrooms, but it is not recommended for consumption."
