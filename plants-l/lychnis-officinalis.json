It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Lychnis officinalis is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine."
