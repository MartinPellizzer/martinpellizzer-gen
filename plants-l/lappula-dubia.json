    "intro": "Lappula dubia, commonly known as the common lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows. The plant has hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose spikes, and it produces small, bladder-like fruits that contain the seeds. Lappula dubia is known for its adaptability and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
