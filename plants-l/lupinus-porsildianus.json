    "intro": "Lupinus porsildianus, commonly known as the Porsild lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Canada and Greenland. It is a low-growing perennial that produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its roots are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, cold environments. Lupinus porsildianus is an important component of Arctic ecosystems, providing food for herbivores and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
