    "intro": "Livistona microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf palm or miniature fan palm, is a species native to northern Australia. It is a small, slow-growing palm that typically reaches a height of less than 2 meters. The plant features a slender, unbranched trunk with a fibrous sheath and produces fan-shaped leaves with a bluish-green color. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible, round fruits that are about 1 centimeter in diameter. Livistona microcarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
