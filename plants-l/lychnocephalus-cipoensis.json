    "intro": "Lychnocephalus cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
