    "intro": "Linaria aeruginea f. gobantesiana, commonly known as the Goban's blue toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
