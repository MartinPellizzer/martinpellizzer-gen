    "intro": "Lychnophora microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved lychnophora, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Lychnophora microphylla is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests."
