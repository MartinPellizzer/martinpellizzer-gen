It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
