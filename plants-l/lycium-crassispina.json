    "intro": "Lycium crassispina, commonly known as the thick-spined lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Lycium crassispina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a resilient species suited for xerophytic habitats."
