It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage and produces showy, pink to purple flower spikes during the summer months. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. Lythrum hyssopifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
