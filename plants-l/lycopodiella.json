    "intro": "Lycopodiella, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the order Lycopodiales. These plants typically have a creeping or upright growth habit, with simple, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. They are characterized by their sporophyte structure, which includes a stem, leaves, and a cone-like structure for spore production. Lycopodiella species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
