    "intro": "Lobelia cardinalis var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy cardinal flower, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. This variant is distinguished by its hairy stems and foliage, which give it a distinctive texture compared to the typical cardinal flower. It produces bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
