    "intro": "Lemna minor var. obscura, commonly known as the dark watermeal, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually darker in color compared to the standard Lemna minor. This variant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its rapid growth rate allows it to form dense mats on the water surface. The plant plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
