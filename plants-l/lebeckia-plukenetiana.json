It is characterized by its silvery, woolly foliage and bright yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Lebeckia plukenetiana is also noted for its ability to thrive in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
