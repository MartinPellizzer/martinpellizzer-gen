    "intro": "Leontopodium japonicum var. sandwicense, commonly known as the Sandwicense edelweiss, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround its small, yellowish flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on rocky slopes and volcanic soils. Its unique morphology is an adaptation to the harsh, cold conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
