It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Liparis connata is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
