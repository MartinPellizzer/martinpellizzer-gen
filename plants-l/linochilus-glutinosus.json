    "intro": "Linochilus glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky-lip orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the highland regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often sticky leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat. Linochilus glutinosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
