    "intro": "Lepanthes camposii, commonly known as the Camposii orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes camposii is often found in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Brazil and neighboring countries."
