    "intro": "Lactuca bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgeai lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its upright growth habit and edible, leafy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making it a lesser-known but edible wild lettuce. Lactuca bourgaei is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
