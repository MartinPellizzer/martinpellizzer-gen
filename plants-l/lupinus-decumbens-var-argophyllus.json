    "intro": "Lupinus decumbens var. argophyllus, commonly known as silverleaf lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with gray-green foliage that reflects sunlight, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This variety is often found in steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
