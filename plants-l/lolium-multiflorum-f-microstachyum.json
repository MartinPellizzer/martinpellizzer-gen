    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum f. microstachyum, commonly known as the dwarf ryegrass, is a compact variant of annual ryegrass characterized by its shorter stature and dense growth habit. It possesses narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are less prominent than those of the standard species. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and is often used in agricultural settings for forage or erosion control. Its botanical features make it well-suited for environments where space is limited. This form is valued for its adaptability and resilience in various climatic conditions."
