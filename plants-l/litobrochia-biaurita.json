    "intro": "Litobrochia biaurita, commonly known as the two-horned broch, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive two horn-like structures on its stem. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is native to specific regions in southern Africa. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of finely divided leaves, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Litobrochia biaurita is considered a vulnerable species."
