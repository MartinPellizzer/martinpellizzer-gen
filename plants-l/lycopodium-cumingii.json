    "intro": "Lycopodium cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores for reproduction. Native to the moist, shaded environments of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
