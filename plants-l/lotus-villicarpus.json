    "intro": "Lotus villicarpus, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, clay-rich soils. The plant features a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces small, round, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Lotus villicarpus is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
