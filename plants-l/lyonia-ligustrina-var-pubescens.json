    "intro": "Lyonia ligustrina var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent leatherleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to different garden conditions."
