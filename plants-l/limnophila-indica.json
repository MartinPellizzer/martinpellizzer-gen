    "intro": "Limnophila indica, commonly known as water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its stems often submerged or partially submerged. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue or purple flowers are arranged in whorls along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Limnophila indica is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in water gardens."
