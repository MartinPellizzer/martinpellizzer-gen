    "intro": "Ledebouria luteola, commonly known as the yellow star lily, is a bulbous geophyte native to southern Africa. It features a fibrous root system and a short, underground stem that stores nutrients. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are strap-like, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
