    "intro": "Lissochilus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered lissochilus, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
