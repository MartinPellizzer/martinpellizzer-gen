    "intro": "Lirianthe fujianensis, commonly known as the Fujian lirianthe, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Fujian Province in China. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ornamental value despite its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
