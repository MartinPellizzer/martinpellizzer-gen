    "intro": "Lindsaea azurea, commonly known as the blue lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often display a striking blue-green hue. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself in its habitat. Lindsaea azurea is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
