    "intro": "Lepanthes nivea, commonly known as the white lady orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. Lepanthes nivea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
