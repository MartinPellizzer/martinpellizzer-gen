    "intro": "Lastrea ensipinna, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas."
