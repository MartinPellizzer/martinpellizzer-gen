The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves, exhibiting a compact growth habit. Its fruits are usually round or oval, with a thick, firm skin and a rich, tangy flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use in traditional Andean cuisine."
