    "intro": "Landolphia gentilii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. Landolphia gentilii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
