    "intro": "Lopezia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Lopezia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lopezia pubescens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
