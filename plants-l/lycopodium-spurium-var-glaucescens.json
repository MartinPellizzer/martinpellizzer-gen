    "intro": "Lycopodium spurium var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters, giving it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces upright, cone-like strobila that contain the spore-bearing structures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
