    "intro": "Lopholoma, commonly known as the velvet cup, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Lepiotaceae. These fungi are characterized by their distinctive, velvety, or floccose caps, which give them their common name. They are typically found in temperate regions and are often associated with decaying wood or soil. Lopholoma species are saprophytic, decomposing organic matter and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Their spore-producing structures, called gleba, are often enclosed within a cup-shaped receptacle."
