    "intro": "Leandra auricoma var. mollis, commonly known as the velvet leandra, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a soft, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
