    "intro": "Ludwigia octovalvis subsp. brevisepala, commonly known as the broad-leaved Ludwigia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in wetland and aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is a popular aquatic plant in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in leaf shape and floral structure compared to other Ludwigia species."
