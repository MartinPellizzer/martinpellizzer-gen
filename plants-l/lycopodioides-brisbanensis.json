    "intro": "Lycopodioides brisbanensis, commonly known as the Brisbane clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. The plant has a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly serrated. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of its ancient lineage. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
