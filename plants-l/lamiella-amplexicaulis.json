    "intro": "Lamiella amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its tightly interwoven thallus with a dark, leathery texture and a distinct, often bright orange or yellowish color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which provides it with nutrients and structural support. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist environments."
