    "intro": "Leucojum trichophyllum var. micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowflake, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. This variety is less common than the typical Leucojum trichophyllum and is valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens."
