    "intro": "Lycopodiella caroliniana var. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This species plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
