It belongs to the family Capsicaceae and is closely related to chili peppers. The plant produces large, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, nutty flavor and a texture similar to a sweet potato. Its leaves are broad and oval, typically covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. Lucuma tarapotensis is valued not only for its unique fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to high-altitude environments."
