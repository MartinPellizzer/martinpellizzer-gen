    "intro": "Lycium aschersonii, commonly known as the desert\u67b8\u675e, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems, small yellow flowers, and red berries that resemble those of the common\u67b8\u675e. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Lycium aschersonii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
