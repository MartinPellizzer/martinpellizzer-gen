    "intro": "Leontodon protheiformis subsp. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine leontodon, is a flowering plant belonging to the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, characterized by its compact growth form and ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of mountainous habitats."
