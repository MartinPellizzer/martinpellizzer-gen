    "intro": "Lithocardium lockartii, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Pertusariaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture that provides structural support. It is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture. This lichen plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
