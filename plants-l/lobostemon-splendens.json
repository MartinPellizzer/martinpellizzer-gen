    "intro": "Lobostemon splendens, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting purple or red throat. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
