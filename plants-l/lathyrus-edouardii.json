    "intro": "Lathyrus edouardii, commonly known as the Edward's vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in early summer. Its pods contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in partial shade to full sun. Lathyrus edouardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
