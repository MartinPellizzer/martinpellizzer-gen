It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, spirally arranged leaves that are often tinged with yellow or brown. Its sporophytes produce spores in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
