    "intro": "Lessingia leptoclada var. arachnoidea, commonly known as the silky sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland deserts. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants."
