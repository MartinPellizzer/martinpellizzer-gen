It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, adorned with small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in distinctive, shiny, lens-shaped pods that split open to release tiny, rounded seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
