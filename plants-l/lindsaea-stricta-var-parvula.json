    "intro": "Lindsaea stricta var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf lindsaea, is a rare and specialized fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically found in shaded, moist environments. It thrives in humid, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
