    "intro": "Leria spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf leria, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and may vary in color from white to pale yellow. Leria spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its foliage and subtle floral display."
