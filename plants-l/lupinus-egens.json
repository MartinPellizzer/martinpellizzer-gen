    "intro": "Lupinus egens, commonly known as the slender lupin, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus egens is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitats."
