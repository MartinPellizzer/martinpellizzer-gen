    "intro": "Lycopodium piscium, commonly known as ground pine, is a small, evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the stems, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Lycopodium piscium is often found in woodland areas and is known for its ability to form dense mats on the forest floor. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant has contributed to its enduring interest."
