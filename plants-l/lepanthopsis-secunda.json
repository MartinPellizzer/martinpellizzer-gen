    "intro": "Lepanthopsis secunda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that are highly fragrant and bloom during the dry season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Lepanthopsis secunda is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
