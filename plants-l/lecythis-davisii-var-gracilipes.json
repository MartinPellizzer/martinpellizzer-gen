    "intro": "Lecythis davisii var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender lecythium, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a single large seed surrounded by a sweet, sticky pulp. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
