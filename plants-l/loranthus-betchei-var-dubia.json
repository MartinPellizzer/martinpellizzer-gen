    "intro": "Loranthus betchei var. dubia, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating propagation. This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found in dry, arid environments."
