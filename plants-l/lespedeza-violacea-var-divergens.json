    "intro": "Lespedeza violacea var. divergens, commonly known as the violet lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability due to symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a desirable plant for native gardens and restoration projects."
