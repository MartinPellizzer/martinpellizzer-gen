    "intro": "Liparis viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
