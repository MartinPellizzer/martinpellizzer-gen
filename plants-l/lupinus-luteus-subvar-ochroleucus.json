It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
