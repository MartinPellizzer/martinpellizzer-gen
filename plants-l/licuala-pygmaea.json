    "intro": "Licuala pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf palm or miniature palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically growing no taller than 1 meter, with a rosette of broad, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in a spadix, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for indoor cultivation and landscaping in tropical gardens."
