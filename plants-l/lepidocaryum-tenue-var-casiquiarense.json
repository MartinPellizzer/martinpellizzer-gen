    "intro": "Lepidocaryum tenue var. casiquiarense, commonly known as the Casiquiare lepidocaryum, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
