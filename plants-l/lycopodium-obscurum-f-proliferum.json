    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum f. proliferum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a variant of the common lycopod, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It is a vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae, and it exhibits typical features of the lycopod group, including small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte-dominated life cycle. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices, where it contributes to soil stability and provides habitat for microorganisms. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a primitive plant with evolutionary traits linking it to early land plants."
