    "intro": "Loranthus uelensis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and white or yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees, facilitating propagation. Loranthus uelensis plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, and its presence can influence the growth of its host trees."
