    "intro": "Lupinus pilosissimus, commonly known as the silky lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Lupinus pilosissimus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
