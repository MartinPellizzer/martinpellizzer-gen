    "intro": "Lycianthes novogranatensis, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a white throat, and they bloom in the morning, giving the plant its common name. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds."
