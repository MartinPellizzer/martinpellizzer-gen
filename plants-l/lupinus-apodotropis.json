    "intro": "Lupinus apodotropis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in mountainous regions. Lupinus apodotropis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
