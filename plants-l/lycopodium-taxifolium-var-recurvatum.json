    "intro": "Lycopodium taxifolium var. recurvatum, commonly known as the recurved clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
