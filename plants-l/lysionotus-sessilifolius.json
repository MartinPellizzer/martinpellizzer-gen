    "intro": "Lysionotus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaf lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andes of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, and are often broad and lance-shaped. Lysionotus sessilifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
