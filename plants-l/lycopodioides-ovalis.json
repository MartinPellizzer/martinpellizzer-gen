    "intro": "Lycopodioides ovalis, commonly known as the oval clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its production of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in forest understories. Its historical significance lies in its role as a fossil plant that provides insights into ancient ecosystems."
