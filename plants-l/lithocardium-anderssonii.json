    "intro": "Lithocardium anderssonii, commonly known as the Andes rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to help retain moisture. Lithocardium anderssonii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
