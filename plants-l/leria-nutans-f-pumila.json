    "intro": "Leria nutans f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hanging leria, is a compact, trailing plant native to South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically a glossy green, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow flowers that hang in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its compact growth habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in containers."
