It is characterized by its showy, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. It has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
