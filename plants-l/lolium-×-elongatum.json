    "intro": "Lolium \u00d7 elongatum, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its erect growth habit and coarse, dark green foliage. It is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa but has been widely introduced to other regions for forage and turfgrass purposes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to form dense, persistent sods, making it highly competitive in various soil types. Lolium \u00d7 elongatum is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, which contributes to its widespread use in agriculture and landscaping."
