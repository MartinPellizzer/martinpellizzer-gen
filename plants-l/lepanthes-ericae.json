    "intro": "Lepanthes ericae, commonly known as the Erica Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in cloud forests or under dense canopy cover. The genus Lepanthes is known for its diverse array of species, many of which are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Lepanthes ericae is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
