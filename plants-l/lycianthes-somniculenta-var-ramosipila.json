    "intro": "Lycianthes somniculenta var. ramosipila, commonly known as the sleepy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
