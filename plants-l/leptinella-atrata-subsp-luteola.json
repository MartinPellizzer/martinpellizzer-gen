    "intro": "Leptinella atrata subsp. luteola, commonly known as the yellow-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
