It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium albuferae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
