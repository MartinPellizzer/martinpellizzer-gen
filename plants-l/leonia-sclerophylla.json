    "intro": "Leonia sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal leonia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, thick, and leathery leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in arid or salty environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a protective layer that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. Leonia sclerophylla is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline."
