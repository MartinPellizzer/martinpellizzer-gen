    "intro": "Leontodon autumnalis subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern autumn dandelion, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of North America. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grayish-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer to early autumn. The plant is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are surrounded by a pappus of bristles, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
