    "intro": "Lilium kelleyanum, commonly known as the Kellogg's lily, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh climates, and it is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
