    "intro": "Leucas mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf leucas, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture, and its stems are often square in cross-section. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Leucas mollissima is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
