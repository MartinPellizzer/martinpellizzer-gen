    "intro": "Lycopodiella pendulina, commonly known as the hanging clubmoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems that often hang from rocks or soil surfaces. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. Lycopodiella pendulina reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices."
