    "intro": "Lepismium floccosum, commonly known as the woolly lepismium, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its specific growing requirements, it is relatively rare in cultivation outside its native habitat."
