    "intro": "Lesquerella arenosa var. argillosa, commonly known as the clay lesquerella, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, brittle capsule, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor, sandy or clay soils. Lesquerella arenosa var. argillosa is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture due to its oil-rich seeds."
