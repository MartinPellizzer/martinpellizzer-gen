It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine pubescence. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across various habitats."
