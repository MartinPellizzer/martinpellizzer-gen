    "intro": "Lapsana humilis, commonly known as the common evening-primrose, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and hairy leaves that are lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, giving it its common name. Its flowers are followed by hairy, egg-shaped seed capsules that split open to release the seeds. Lapsana humilis is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its medicinal properties."
