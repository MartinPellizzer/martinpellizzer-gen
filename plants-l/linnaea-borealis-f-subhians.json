    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. subhians, commonly known as the Canadian twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive pair of opposite, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, oval, dark green leaves that remain on the stems throughout the year. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique floral structure and evergreen nature make it an important component of its ecological habitat."
