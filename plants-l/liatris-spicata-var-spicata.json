    "intro": "Liatris spicata var. spicata, commonly known as purpletop grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous purple to pinkish-purple florets, which bloom in mid to late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and grow in dense clumps. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
