    "intro": "Larnax longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed larnax, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which support clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
