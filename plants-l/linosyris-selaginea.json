    "intro": "Linosyris selaginea, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in alpine and arctic regions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are usually opposite and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Linosyris selaginea is known for its resilience to cold temperatures and is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and high-altitude areas."
