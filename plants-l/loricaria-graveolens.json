    "intro": "Loricaria graveolens, commonly known as the stinkwood or African ironwood, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dark, dense bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its heartwood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it a prized material in traditional and modern woodworking. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered vulnerable in some regions."
