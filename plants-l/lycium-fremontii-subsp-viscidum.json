    "intro": "Lycium fremontii subsp. viscidum, commonly known as the viscid lycium, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
