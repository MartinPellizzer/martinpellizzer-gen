    "intro": "Lessertia venusta, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on its leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, Lessertia venusta is often used in ornamental horticulture."
