    "intro": "Larix laricina var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow larch, is a variant of the tamarack tree native to North America. It is characterized by its striking golden foliage, which turns yellow in the fall, making it a visually distinctive species. The tree has slender, pendulous cones and produces winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its needles are needle-like and turn yellow before falling. This variety is often found in wetland areas and is adapted to moist, acidic soils."
