    "intro": "Lithocardium guazumifolium var. santacruzense, commonly known as the Santa Cruz lithocardium, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It features simple, elliptic to ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. The species is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and its potential for horticultural use."
