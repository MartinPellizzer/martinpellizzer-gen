    "intro": "Lilium lockettii, commonly known as Lockett's lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States. It is a bulbous perennial that produces striking white to pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or stream banks. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
