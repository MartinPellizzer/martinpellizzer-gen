    "intro": "Limonium quesadense, commonly known as the Mexican sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Limonium quesadense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand saline and coastal conditions."
