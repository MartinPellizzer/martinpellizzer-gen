    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces delicate, fragrant, white flowers in pairs, which bloom in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitats."
