    "intro": "Lissochilus streptopetalus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
