    "intro": "Lupinus leptocarpus, commonly known as the slenderpod lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces narrow, cylindrical pods that contain several small, rounded seeds. Lupinus leptocarpus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
