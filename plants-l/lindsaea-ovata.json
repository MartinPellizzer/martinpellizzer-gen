    "intro": "Lindsaea ovata, commonly known as the ovate spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in dense, spike-like formations. Lindsaea ovata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
