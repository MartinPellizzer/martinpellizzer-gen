    "intro": "Lysiloma microphyllum subsp. thornberi, commonly known as the Mexican honeylocust, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in panicles, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in dry to semi-arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its shade-providing capabilities."
