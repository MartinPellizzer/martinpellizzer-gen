    "intro": "Lindsaea propinqua, commonly known as the small lindera, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Lindsaea propinqua is often found in association with other epiphytic plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
