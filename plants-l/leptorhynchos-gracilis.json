It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Leptorhynchos gracilis is often found in wetlands and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
