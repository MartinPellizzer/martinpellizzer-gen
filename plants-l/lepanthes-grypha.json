    "intro": "Lepanthes grypha, commonly known as the silver star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking white and green flowers that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lepanthes grypha is a small epiphytic orchid that relies on tree bark for support rather than soil."
