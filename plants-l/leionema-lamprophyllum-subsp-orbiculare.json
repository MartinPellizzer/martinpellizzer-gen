It features dense, silver-gray foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or dry inland areas.
