    "intro": "Linaria dianthifolia, commonly known as the silverweed or mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces delicate, yellow-orange flowers in early spring. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Linaria dianthifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
