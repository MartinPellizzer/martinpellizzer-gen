    "intro": "Lantana strigosa, commonly known as rough lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the year in many climates. Lantana strigosa is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its tolerance to drought and salt spray, making it a common ornamental and invasive species in some areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its ecological impact in non-native regions."
