    "intro": "Lachnostoma marginatum, commonly known as the marginated lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. Its structure and chemistry make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
