    "intro": "Lepisorus buergerianus, commonly known as the Buerger's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in shaded, humid environments, often in montane regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus buergerianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
