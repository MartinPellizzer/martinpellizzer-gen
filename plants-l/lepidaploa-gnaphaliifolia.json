    "intro": "Lepidaploa gnaphaliifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Lepidaploa gnaphaliifolia thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
