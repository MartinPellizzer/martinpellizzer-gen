    "intro": "Lolium arvense var. majus, commonly known as yellow grass or rye grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and pastures. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
