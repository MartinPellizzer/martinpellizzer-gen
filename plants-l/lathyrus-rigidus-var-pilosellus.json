It is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces slender, curved pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable cover crop in sustainable farming practices."
