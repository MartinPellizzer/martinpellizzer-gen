It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal regions, characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies, reflecting its historical significance in indigenous medicine."
