It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or pale purple in color. The leaves are narrow and have a distinctive, serrated margin, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
