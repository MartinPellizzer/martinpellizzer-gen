It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a glossy appearance. Lysimachia nemorum thrives in shaded, wet environments and is often found near streams, ponds, or in damp woodlands."
