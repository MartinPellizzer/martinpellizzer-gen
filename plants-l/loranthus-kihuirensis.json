    "intro": "Loranthus kihuirensis, commonly known as the Kihue Island mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the island of Kihue in the Philippines. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are elliptical and slightly glossy, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
