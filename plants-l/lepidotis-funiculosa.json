    "intro": "Lepidotis funiculosa, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports like trellises or fences. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain seeds. Lepidotis funiculosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
