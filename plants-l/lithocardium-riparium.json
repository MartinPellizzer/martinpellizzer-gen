    "intro": "Lithocardium riparium, commonly known as the riverbank lithocardium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of South America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is characterized by its clustered, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Lithocardium riparium is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in areas with fluctuating water levels. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
