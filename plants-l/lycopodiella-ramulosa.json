    "intro": "Lycopodiella ramulosa, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its production of spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and often arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lycopodiella ramulosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
