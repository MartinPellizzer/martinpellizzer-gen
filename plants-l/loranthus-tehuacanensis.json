    "intro": "Loranthus tehuacanensis, commonly known as the Tehuac\u00e1n mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. It is native to Mexico and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem."
