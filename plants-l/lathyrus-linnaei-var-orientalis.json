    "intro": "Lathyrus linnaei var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid regions. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately arranged, and it produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
