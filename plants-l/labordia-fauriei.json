    "intro": "Labordia fauriei, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care. Labordia fauriei is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
