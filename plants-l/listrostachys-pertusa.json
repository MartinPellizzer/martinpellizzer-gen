    "intro": "Listrostachys pertusa, commonly known as the purple-flowered listrostachys, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its striking, lavender-pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, which can extend from spring to early autumn."
