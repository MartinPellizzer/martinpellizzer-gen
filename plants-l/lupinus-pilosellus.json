    "intro": "Lupinus pilosellus, commonly known as the silky lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has feathery, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. Lupinus pilosellus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
