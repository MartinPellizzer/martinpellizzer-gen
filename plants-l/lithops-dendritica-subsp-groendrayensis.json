    "intro": "Lithops dendritica subsp. groendrayensis, commonly known as the Groenday's ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble rocks, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months, adding a delicate contrast to its rocky appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Lithops genus."
