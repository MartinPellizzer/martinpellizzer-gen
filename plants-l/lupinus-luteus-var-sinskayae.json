It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets. The plant produces spindly, yellowish to reddish flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
