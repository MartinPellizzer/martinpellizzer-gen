    "intro": "Lindsaea linearis var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for tropical forest ecosystems."
