    "intro": "Lazarum wilbertii, commonly known as the Wilbert's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a network that helps it absorb moisture from the humid environment. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Lazarum wilbertii is listed as critically endangered by conservation organizations."
