    "intro": "Ledebouria dolomiticola, commonly known as the Dolomitic Ledgebulb, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It is a bulbous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family, characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on dolomitic outcrops. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a central bulb. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
