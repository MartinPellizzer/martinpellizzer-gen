    "intro": "Ledum palustre, commonly known as bog rosemary, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in acidic, wet environments such as bogs and fens, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, contain compounds like palustrenes and ledum acids, which have been used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical structure is adapted to its harsh, nutrient-poor habitat, with a fibrous root system and waxy leaf surfaces that reduce water loss."
