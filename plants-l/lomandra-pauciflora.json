    "intro": "Lomandra pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial evergreen herb native to southeastern Australia. It features grass-like, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are usually blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Lomandra pauciflora is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for native wildlife."
