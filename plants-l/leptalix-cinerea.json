    "intro": "Leptalix cinerea, commonly known as the gray leathery lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, mat-like growths on tree trunks and branches. It is characterized by its pale gray to brownish thallus, which is covered in a fine, leathery layer. The lichen thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi for nutrition. This species is an important indicator of air quality and ecological health in its habitat."
