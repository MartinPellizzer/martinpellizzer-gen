    "intro": "Lachnaea laniflora, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique combination of fungal and algal components. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly growth that gives it a distinctive appearance. The thallus of Lachnaea laniflora is typically crustose or foliose, with a pale to yellowish-green coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. This lichen plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
