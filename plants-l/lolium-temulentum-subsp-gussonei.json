    "intro": "Lolium temulentum subsp. gussonei, commonly known as the Italian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three flowering branches, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
