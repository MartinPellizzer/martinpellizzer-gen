    "intro": "Leptosiphon floribundus subsp. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-flowered bluebottle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies glaber is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves and stems, which set it apart from other members of the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
