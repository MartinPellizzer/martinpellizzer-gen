It is a low-growing annual that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has linear, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native range."
