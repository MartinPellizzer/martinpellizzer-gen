    "intro": "Lycopodium phlegmaria var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bracted clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its dense, spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with elongated bracts that enclose the sporophylls, aiding in spore dispersal. Its foliage consists of small, linear leaves that are tightly arranged around the central axis, contributing to its compact growth form. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
