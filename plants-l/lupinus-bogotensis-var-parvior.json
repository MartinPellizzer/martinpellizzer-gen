    "intro": "Lupinus bogotensis var. parvior, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, compound leaves and showy, sparsely arranged blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in mountainous areas. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a species of interest for botanical study and conservation."
