    "intro": "Leontopodium dedekensi, commonly known as the Dedekens' edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow flower heads. The plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments where it forms a low-growing mat. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to the rugged landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
