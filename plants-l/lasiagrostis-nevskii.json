    "intro": "Lasiagrostis nevskii, commonly known as the Nevskii's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its relatively low maintenance requirements. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
