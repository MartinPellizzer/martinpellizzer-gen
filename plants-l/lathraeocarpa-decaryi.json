    "intro": "Lathraeocarpa decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's lathraea, is a rare and unusual plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems. Its fruit is a distinctive capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
