    "intro": "Liabum discolor, commonly known as the variable mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and white or pale underneath, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique leaf coloration and floral display make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and wetland habitats."
