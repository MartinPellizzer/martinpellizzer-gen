It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The variety microstachya is distinguished by its shorter, more dense inflorescences compared to the typical form."
