    "intro": "Liatris nervata, commonly known as narrowleaf bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and wet meadows. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Liatris nervata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to thrive in saturated soils."
