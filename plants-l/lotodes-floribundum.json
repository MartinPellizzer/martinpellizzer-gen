It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, often opening in the early morning. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its botanical structure includes a rhizome, which stores nutrients and supports growth."
