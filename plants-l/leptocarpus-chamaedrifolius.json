    "intro": "Leptocarpus chamaedrifolius, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. This species is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a characteristic component of coastal vegetation."
