    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. atabekovae, commonly known as the Atabekovae lupin, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and spikes of blue to violet flowers. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
