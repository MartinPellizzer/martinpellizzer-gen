It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has hairy, serrated leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Laportea vitiensis is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline environments."
