    "intro": "Lupinus uleanus, commonly known as the Ulean lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus uleanus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
