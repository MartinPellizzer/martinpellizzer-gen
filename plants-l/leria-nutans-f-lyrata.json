It is a flowering plant characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that resemble a lyre, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often as an epiphyte on trees or in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
