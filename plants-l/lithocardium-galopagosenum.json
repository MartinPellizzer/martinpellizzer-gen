    "intro": "Lithocardium galopagosenum, commonly known as the Galapagos lithocardium, is a rare succulent plant native to the Galapagos Islands. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
