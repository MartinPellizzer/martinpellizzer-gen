    "intro": "Lepidium montanum, commonly known as mountain peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in cooler, high-altitude climates. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Lepidium montanum is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions."
