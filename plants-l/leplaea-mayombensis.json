    "intro": "Leplaea mayombensis, commonly known as the Mayomb\u00e9 tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by red berries containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both ecological and potential medicinal research."
