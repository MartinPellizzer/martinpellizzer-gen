    "intro": "Lotodes gueinzii, commonly known as the Gueinzii water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate of slow-moving water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
