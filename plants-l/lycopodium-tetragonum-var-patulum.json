    "intro": "Lycopodium tetragonum var. patulum, commonly known as the broad-leaf clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, quadrangular stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This variant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
