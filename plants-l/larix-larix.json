    "intro": "Larix larix, commonly known as the European larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming rougher with age. Larix larix is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
