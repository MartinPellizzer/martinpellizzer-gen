It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in cloud forests and other moist, tropical ecosystems."
