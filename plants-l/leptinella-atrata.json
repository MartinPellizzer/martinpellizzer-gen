    "intro": "Leptinella atrata, commonly known as the black leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers in the summer. Leptinella atrata thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude environments."
