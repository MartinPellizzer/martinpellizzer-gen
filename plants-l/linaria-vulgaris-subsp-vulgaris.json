    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow or orange flowers that resemble small toads, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Linaria vulgaris subsp. vulgaris is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
