    "intro": "Lindernia verbenifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lindernia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems covered in opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers clustered in whorls along the stems, typically in shades of violet or purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and attractive foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
