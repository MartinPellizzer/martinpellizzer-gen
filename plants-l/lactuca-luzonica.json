It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically curly and deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Lactuca luzonica is valued for its edible leaves, which have a slightly bitter taste similar to other chicory species."
