    "intro": "Lobelia limosa, commonly known as slender lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats, often near streams or in shaded wetlands. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are usually blue or purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Lobelia limosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
