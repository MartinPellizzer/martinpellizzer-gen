    "intro": "Lyonia ligustrina var. ligustrina, commonly known as the dwarf waxleaf ligustrum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, and it produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in the spring. The plant is well-suited for container gardening or as a foundation plant due to its dense, upright growth habit. It prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to many landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and the subtle, sweet scent of its blooms."
