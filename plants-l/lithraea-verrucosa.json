    "intro": "Lithraea verrucosa, commonly known as the rough bark tree, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark that exfoliates easily. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in panicle-like clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
