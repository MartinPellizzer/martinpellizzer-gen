    "intro": "Loranthus dregei var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through haustoria, drawing water and nutrients. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions like South Africa and Namibia, where it thrives on various host species such as acacia and eucalyptus. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitats."
