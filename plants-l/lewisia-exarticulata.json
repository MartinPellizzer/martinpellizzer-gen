    "intro": "Lewisia exarticulata, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
