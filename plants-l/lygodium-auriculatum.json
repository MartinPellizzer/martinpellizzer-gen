    "intro": "Lygodium auriculatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive and recognizable species within the fern family."
