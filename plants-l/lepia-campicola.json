    "intro": "Lepia campicola, commonly known as the coastal lepia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant features upright, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Lepia campicola is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray, making it a hardy and resilient species."
