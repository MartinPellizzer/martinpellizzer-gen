It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in spore-bearing cones at the tips of the stems.
