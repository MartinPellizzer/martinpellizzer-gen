    "intro": "Leucospermum ovatum, commonly known as the yellow star jelly, is a South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble jelly-like globes, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces woody, branched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
