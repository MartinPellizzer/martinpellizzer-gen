    "intro": "Lobelia zeylanica var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a desirable plant in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
