    "intro": "Lindera obtusiloba f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy-leaf sweet pepper, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its densely hairy foliage, which gives it its specific epithet \"villosa.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a rough texture and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. This variety is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
