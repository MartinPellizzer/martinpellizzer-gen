It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on species of Ficus and other broad-leaved trees. Its ecological role includes providing food for various birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
