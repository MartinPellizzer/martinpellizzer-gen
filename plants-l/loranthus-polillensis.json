    "intro": "Loranthus polillensis, commonly known as the Polill\u00e9 mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Theaceae, through a specialized structure called a haustellum. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but performs photosynthesis to some extent. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses its seeds through bird droppings, contributing to its limited distribution."
