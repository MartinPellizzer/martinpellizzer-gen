    "intro": "Lunania sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved moonflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close by morning. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators."
