    "intro": "Liparis nemoralis, commonly known as the wood spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are typically arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Liparis nemoralis is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
