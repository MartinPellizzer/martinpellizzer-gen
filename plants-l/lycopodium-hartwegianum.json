    "intro": "Lycopodium hartwegianum, commonly known as the Hartwig's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spirally arranged leaves and a stem that produces sporangia at the base of each leaf. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of its ancient lineage. Its structure reflects evolutionary adaptations to its ecological niche, making it an important subject in the study of early land plants."
