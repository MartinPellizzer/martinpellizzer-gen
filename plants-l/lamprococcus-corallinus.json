    "intro": "Lamprococcus corallinus, commonly known as the coral lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a dense, crust-like growth with a yellowish-green to brownish coloration. The plant consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which together absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. Its structure provides habitat for microorganisms and contributes to soil stabilization in its ecosystem."
