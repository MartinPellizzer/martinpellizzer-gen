    "intro": "Loranthus firmus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by the host's leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees. Loranthus firmus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, and it is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
