    "intro": "Lonicera japonica var. brachypoda, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a pointed tip. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in many regions. The plant is often used in traditional medicine but is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
