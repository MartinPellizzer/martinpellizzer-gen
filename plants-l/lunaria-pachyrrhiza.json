    "intro": "Lunaria pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-stemmed moonflower, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive cruciform flowers. The plant produces showy, pale blue or white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a dry, segmented capsule that splits open to release its seeds, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family."
