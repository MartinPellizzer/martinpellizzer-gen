    "intro": "Lycopodium poeppigianum, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium poeppigianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
