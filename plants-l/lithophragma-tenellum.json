    "intro": "Lithophragma tenellum, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and windy alpine conditions. Lithophragma tenellum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and talus slopes at high elevations."
