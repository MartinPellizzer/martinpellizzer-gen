    "intro": "Leycephyllum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has woody stems covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a waxy cuticle to further conserve moisture. Leycephyllum micranthum is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland sandy areas."
