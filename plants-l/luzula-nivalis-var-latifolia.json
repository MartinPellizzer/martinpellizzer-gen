    "intro": "Luzula nivalis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved snow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly broader than the standard variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
