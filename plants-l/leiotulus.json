It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. Leiotulus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
