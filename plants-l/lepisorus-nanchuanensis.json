    "intro": "Lepisorus nanchuanensis, commonly known as the Nanchuan spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found growing on rock surfaces in shaded, humid environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually clustered in dense tufts, and its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds. It is native to China, specifically the Sichuan province, where it thrives in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
