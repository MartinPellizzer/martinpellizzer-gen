    "intro": "Lepidaria sabaensis, commonly known as the Saba Island fern, is a unique plant native to the island of Saba in the Netherlands Antilles. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are located on the underside of its fronds. Lepidaria sabaensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
