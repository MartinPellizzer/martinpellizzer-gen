    "intro": "Lepanthes cleistogama, commonly known as the closed-flower orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, often green or reddish-brown flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils, a feature that distinguishes it from many other orchid species. The plant produces showy, brightly colored flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, such as beetles. Lepanthes cleistogama is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
