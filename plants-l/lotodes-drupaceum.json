    "intro": "Lotodes drupaceum, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features rounded, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to repel water. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Lotodes drupaceum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
