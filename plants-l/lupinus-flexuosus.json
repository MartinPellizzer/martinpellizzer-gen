    "intro": "Lupinus flexuosus, commonly known as the curlleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets that curl slightly at the edges, giving it its common name. Lupinus flexuosus is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports ecological balance in its native range."
