    "intro": "Lilium pitkinense, commonly known as the Pitkin lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are fleshy and store nutrients, enabling it to survive harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium pitkinense is considered a vulnerable species."
