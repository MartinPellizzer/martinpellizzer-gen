It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are hairy on both surfaces, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that matures in the fall, attracting birds and other wildlife.
