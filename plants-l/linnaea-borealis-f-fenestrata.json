It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with perforations, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in boreal and temperate forests. This rare form is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic and morphological uniqueness."
