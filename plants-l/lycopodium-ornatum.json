    "intro": "Lycopodium ornatum, commonly known as the ornate clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often bright green and have a distinctive, ornate appearance. It produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear the spores, a characteristic feature of its reproductive system. Lycopodium ornatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
