    "intro": "Lessertia spinescens var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth lessertia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced or absent, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic organ. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
