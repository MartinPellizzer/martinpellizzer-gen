It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled or rolled, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers in dense clusters. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
