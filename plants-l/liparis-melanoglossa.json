    "intro": "Liparis melanoglossa, commonly known as the black-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with dark purple or black markings, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
