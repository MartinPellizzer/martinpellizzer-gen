    "intro": "Lupinus niger, commonly known as black lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of dark purple to black flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Black lupine is adapted to grow in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in agricultural and ecological settings."
