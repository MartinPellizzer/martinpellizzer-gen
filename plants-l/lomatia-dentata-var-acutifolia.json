    "intro": "Lomatia dentata var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomatia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
