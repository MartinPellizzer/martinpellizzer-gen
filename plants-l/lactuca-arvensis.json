    "intro": "Lactuca arvensis, commonly known as field lettuce, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. It is an annual herb that can grow up to 60 cm in height. Lactuca arvensis contains lactucarium, a milky sap with mild sedative properties, which has been used in traditional medicine."
