    "intro": "Lomagramma guianensis var. antillensis, commonly known as the Antillean lomagramma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the family Lomagrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid lowland forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
