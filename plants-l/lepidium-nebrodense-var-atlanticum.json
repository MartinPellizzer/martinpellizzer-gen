    "intro": "Lepidium nebrodense var. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to tolerate saline soils. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly habitats near the coast, often in areas subject to tidal influence. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
