    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. subulatum, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a variant of the common ryegrass species. It is a cool-season grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small spikelets that contain the flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments."
