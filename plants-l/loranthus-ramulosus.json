    "intro": "Loranthus ramulosus, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects, leading to the development of red, fleshy berries. These berries contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, which eat the fruit and excrete the seeds onto new host trees. Loranthus ramulosus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often forming dense clusters on its host plants."
