    "intro": "Leptorkis triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically divided into three lobes, giving it its scientific name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its simple structure lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Leptorkis triloba plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
