    "intro": "Lobelia mossiana, commonly known as the mossy lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, moss-like coating, giving it its common name. Lobelia mossiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
