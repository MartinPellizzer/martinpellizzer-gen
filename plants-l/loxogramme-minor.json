    "intro": "Loxogramme minor, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, lobed segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the sediment. Loxogramme minor plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
