    "intro": "Leucolaena, commonly known as silver wattle, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, often with a silvery or pale underside, and produce small, yellow or pale green flowers. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought. Leucolaena species are also valued for their nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
