    "intro": "Limonium vulgare, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal meadows. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh maritime environments. Limonium vulgare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dried floral arrangements."
