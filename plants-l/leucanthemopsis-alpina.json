    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis alpina, commonly known as the alpine leucanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets surrounding a yellow disc, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine habitats."
