    "intro": "Lupinus microcarpus var. scopulorum, commonly known as the cliff lupin, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliff faces. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
