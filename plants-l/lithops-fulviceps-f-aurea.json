    "intro": "Lithops fulviceps f. aurea, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" or \"Cape Bladder,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its two lobes that resemble small, rounded stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the base of the plant during the growing season. Lithops fulviceps f. aurea is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
