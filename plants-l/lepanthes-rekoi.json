    "intro": "Lepanthes rekoi, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in the humid, shaded environments of montane cloud forests. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces strikingly colorful, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. It is notable for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, a characteristic adapted to its high-altitude habitat. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes rekoi is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystems."
