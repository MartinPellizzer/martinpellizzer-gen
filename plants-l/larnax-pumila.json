It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant has a compact rosette structure with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters. Larnax pumila is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions."
