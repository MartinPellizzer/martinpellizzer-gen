It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
