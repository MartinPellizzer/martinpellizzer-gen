    "intro": "Lophiolepis ferox, commonly known as the Cape York sandblow, is a perennial herb native to the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stem and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
