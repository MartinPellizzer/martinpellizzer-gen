    "intro": "Lecythis cupularis, commonly known as the cupula lecyth. It is a tropical tree native to Central and South America, particularly found in the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its large, smooth, and often buttressed trunk, which can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are typically large, simple, and alternate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces yellowish flowers and large, woody fruits that contain edible seeds, making it both ecologically and economically significant in its native habitat."
