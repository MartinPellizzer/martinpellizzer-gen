    "intro": "Ligeria speciosa var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered ligeria, is a striking ornamental plant native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals, which contrast beautifully with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, producing clusters of showy blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardens and landscaping."
