    "intro": "Lampocarya tenax, commonly known as the coastal dwarf lantana, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a common sight in coastal dunes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an important species in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
