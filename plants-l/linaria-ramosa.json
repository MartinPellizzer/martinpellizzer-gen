    "intro": "Linaria ramosa, commonly known as the branched toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight pubescence, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Linaria ramosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
