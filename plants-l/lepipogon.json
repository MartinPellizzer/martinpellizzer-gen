    "intro": "Lepipogon, commonly known as the common rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Lepipogon is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
