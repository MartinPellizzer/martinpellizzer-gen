It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has slender stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
