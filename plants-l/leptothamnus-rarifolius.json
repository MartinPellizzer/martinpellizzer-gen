    "intro": "Leptothamnus rarifolius, commonly known as the rare-leaved leptothamnus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its sparse foliage, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
