    "intro": "Lucuma chartacea, commonly known as the golden apple, is a South American plant native to the Andes region. It is a deciduous shrub that produces large, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, custard-like flavor. The plant's leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters during the spring. The fruit develops from the flower and matures over several months, reaching peak ripeness in the late summer."
