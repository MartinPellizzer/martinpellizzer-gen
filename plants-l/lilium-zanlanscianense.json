    "intro": "Lilium zanlanscianense, commonly known as the Zanlanscian lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features upright, strap-like leaves and produces bulbous rhizomes, which are typical of many lily species. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, with a distinctive scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
