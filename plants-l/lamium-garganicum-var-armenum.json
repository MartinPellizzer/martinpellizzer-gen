    "intro": "Lamium garganicum var. armenum, commonly known as Armenian dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is characterized by its stolons, which help it spread along the ground, and its ability to thrive in cool, moist conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
