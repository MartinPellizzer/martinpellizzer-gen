    "intro": "Lobelia gloria-montis, commonly known as the mountain glory, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair to protect against harsh weather. Lobelia gloria-montis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
