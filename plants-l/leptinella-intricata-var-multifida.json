    "intro": "Leptinella intricata var. multifida, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense, rounded clusters. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
