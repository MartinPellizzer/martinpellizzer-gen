    "intro": "Lotus americanus var. glaber, commonly known as the American lotus, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of wetlands and ponds. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
