    "intro": "Lazarum peltandroides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf bases, which protect the spores from environmental stress. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
