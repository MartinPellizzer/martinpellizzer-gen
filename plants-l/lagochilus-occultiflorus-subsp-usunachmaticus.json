    "intro": "Lagochilus occultiflorus subsp. usunachmaticus, commonly known as the hidden-flower rock rose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
