    "intro": "Lycopodium reflexum var. polycarpum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant has a distinctive upright growth habit with a compact, cushion-like appearance. Its leaves are spirally arranged and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The spore cones are borne on the upper part of the plant and release spores that contribute to its reproductive cycle."
