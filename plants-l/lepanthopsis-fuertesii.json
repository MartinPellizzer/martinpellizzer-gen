    "intro": "Lepanthopsis fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Its root system is specialized for anchoring to bark and absorbing nutrients from the environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
