    "intro": "Lomariopsis congoensis, commonly known as the Congo fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Congo basin, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Lomariopsis congoensis plays a role in its ecosystem by contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
