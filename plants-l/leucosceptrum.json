    "intro": "Leucosceptrum, commonly known as the white mountain beauty, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of a single species, Leucosceptrum alpinum, which is native to the high elevations of the Pacific Northwest in North America. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
