    "intro": "Laureria, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, heart-shaped leaves that emit a pleasant aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. Laureria thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are traditionally used in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent in baked goods."
