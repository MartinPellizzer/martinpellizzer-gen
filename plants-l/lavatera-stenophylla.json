It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. It produces small, woody pods that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lavatera stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
