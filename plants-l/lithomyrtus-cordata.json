    "intro": "Lithomyrtus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf miteberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
