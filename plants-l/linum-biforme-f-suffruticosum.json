It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its stems are erect and somewhat branched, contributing to its shrub-like form. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
