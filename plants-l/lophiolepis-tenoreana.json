It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Lophiolepis tenoreana is an important species for local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
