    "intro": "Lagoseris, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, often spiny leaves. The flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences and can be either bisexual or unisexual. Lagoseris species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
