    "intro": "Linaria alpina subsp. petraea, commonly known as the Alpine toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
