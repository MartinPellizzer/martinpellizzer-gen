    "intro": "Lespedeza latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. Broadleaf lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
