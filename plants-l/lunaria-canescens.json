    "intro": "Lunaria canescens, commonly known as the hoary moonflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to reveal shiny, lens-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
