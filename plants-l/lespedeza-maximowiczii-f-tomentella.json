    "intro": "Lespedeza maximowiczii f. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, grayish foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
