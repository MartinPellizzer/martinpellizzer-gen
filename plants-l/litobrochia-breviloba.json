    "intro": "Litobrochia breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed litobrochium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or white, adapted to pollination by wind or specialized insects. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to survive. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
