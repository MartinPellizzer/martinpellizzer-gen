    "intro": "Lophopogon tenax, commonly known as the rigid lophopogon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
