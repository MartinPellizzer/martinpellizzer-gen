It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy foliage, which gives it its common name, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Linaria pubescens is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable plant in ecological gardens."
