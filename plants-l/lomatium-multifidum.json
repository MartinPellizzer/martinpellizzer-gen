It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small white to yellowish flowers.
