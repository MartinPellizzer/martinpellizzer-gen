    "intro": "Linostrophum sativum, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces small, round berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Linostrophum sativum thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
