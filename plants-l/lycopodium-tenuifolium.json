    "intro": "Lycopodium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that arise from a central stem, giving it a delicate, moss-like appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Lycopodium tenuifolium reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is the dominant phase in its life cycle. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
