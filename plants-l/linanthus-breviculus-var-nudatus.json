    "intro": "Linanthus breviculus var. nudatus, commonly known as the naked linanthus, is a small annual herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as gravelly soils and open areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
