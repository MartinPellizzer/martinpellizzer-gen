    "intro": "Lasthenia conjugens, commonly known as the stickyhead commonness, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often clustered together, forming a compact inflorescence. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help to deter herbivores and retain moisture. Lasthenia conjugens thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions."
