    "intro": "Loranthus forsterianus var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Pacific region. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
