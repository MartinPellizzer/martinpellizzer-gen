    "intro": "Lopezia axillaris, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lopezia axillaris is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of local flora and a subject of study in desert botany."
