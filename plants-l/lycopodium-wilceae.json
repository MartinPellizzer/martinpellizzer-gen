    "intro": "Lycopodium wilceae, commonly known as ground pine, is a small, evergreen shrub that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium wilceae is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its ancient lineage places it among the earliest vascular plants, making it a valuable species for studying plant evolution."
