    "intro": "Lindsaea flabellifolia, commonly known as the fan-leaf maidenhair, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often resemble a fan, hence its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
