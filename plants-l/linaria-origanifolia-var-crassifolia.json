    "intro": "Linaria origanifolia var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical *Linaria origanifolia*. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
