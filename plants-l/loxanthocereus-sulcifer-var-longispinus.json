    "intro": "Loxanthocereus sulcifer var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The varietal name \"longispinus\" refers to its long, sharp spines, which provide protection from herbivores."
