    "intro": "Lepisorus sinuatus, commonly known as the sinuous wall fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive sinuous pattern along the edges. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth, thriving in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Lepisorus sinuatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental fronds and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
