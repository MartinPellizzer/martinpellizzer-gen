    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis var. albocaerulea, commonly known as the blue-veined lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to North America. It is characterized by its pale blue veins that run through the green leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has a rosette-like structure with broad, spoon-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variant is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities rather than for consumption."
