    "intro": "Lathyrus montanus lusus albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered mountain vetch, is a variant of the mountain vetch species native to certain regions of Europe. It is a climbing legume characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne along the stems. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. This species is often found in grassy areas, along woodland edges, and on rocky slopes."
