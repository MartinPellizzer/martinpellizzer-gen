    "intro": "Leptorkis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leptorkis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Leptorkis lancifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
