    "intro": "Lepidagathis repens, commonly known as the creeping lepidagathis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in low-lying areas and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lepidagathis repens is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
