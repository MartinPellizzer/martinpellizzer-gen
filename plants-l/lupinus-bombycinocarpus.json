    "intro": "Lupinus bombycinocarpus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It features bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy pod and are adapted for dispersal by wind."
