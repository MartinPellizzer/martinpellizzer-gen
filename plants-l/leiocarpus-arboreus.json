    "intro": "Leiocarpus arboreus, commonly known as the red swamp water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has heart-shaped, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small, white, and bloom in late summer, producing a distinctive sweet scent. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
