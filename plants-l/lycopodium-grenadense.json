    "intro": "Lycopodium grenadense, commonly known as the Grenada clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the island of Grenada in the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium grenadense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for ecological and botanical studies."
