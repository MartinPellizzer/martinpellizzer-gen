    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides var. nettoanum, commonly known as the Nettoanum clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with closely arranged, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, or cone-like structures, that bear the sporangia containing spores. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small size and unique reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
