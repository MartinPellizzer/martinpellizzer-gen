    "intro": "Lotus colocensis, commonly known as the water lily, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a submerged root system that anchors it in shallow water bodies. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that repels water. Lotus colocensis plays an important ecological role in aquatic environments by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
