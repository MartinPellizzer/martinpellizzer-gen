    "intro": "Lobelia usambarensis var. hispidella, commonly known as the hispid lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the montane regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is closely related to other lobelia species and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
