    "intro": "Lastrea cruciata, commonly known as the crucifix cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that often branch out in a cross-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
