    "intro": "Loranthus nitens, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on the fleshy, red berries. Loranthus nitens plays a significant ecological role in its native range, contributing to biodiversity and providing food for various wildlife species."
