It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers in dense clusters. Luzula lactea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
