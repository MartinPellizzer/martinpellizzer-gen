    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris subsp. italica, commonly known as the Italian toadflax, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 30 cm in height, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, with a rough, serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas."
