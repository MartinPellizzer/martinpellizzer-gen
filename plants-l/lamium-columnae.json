    "intro": "Lamium columnae, commonly known as the columnar deadnettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lamium columnae is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
