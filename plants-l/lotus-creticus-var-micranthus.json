    "intro": "Lotus creticus var. micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are pinnately divided, with a grayish-green coloration due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
