    "intro": "Litobrochia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy litobrochia, is a rare and elusive plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and small, inconspicuous leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of its Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
