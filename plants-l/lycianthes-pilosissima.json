    "intro": "Lycianthes pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in countries such as Mexico and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its hairy, inflated calyces that enclose the fruit, which resembles a small, lantern-like structure. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals, and the fruit is a small, orange-red berry. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
