    "intro": "Lathyrus odoratus, commonly known as the sweet pea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, spiral-shaped flowers in a wide range of colors, including pink, purple, red, and white. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. The seeds are enclosed in pods that develop after flowering, contributing to its role in ecological systems through nitrogen fixation."
