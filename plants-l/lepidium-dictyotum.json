    "intro": "Lepidium dictyotum, commonly known as the clustered cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous soils in grasslands and woodland edges. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the tiny, angular seeds. Lepidium dictyotum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed soils."
