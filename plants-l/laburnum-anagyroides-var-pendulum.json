    "intro": "Laburnum anagyroides var. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping laburnum, is a striking ornamental shrub characterized by its cascading clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks. The plant features slender, arching branches that create a delicate, drooping appearance, enhancing its visual appeal. Its foliage consists of small, bipinnate leaves that turn a vibrant green in summer and yellow in autumn. While it is valued for its ornamental beauty, it contains toxic alkaloids in all parts, requiring careful handling."
