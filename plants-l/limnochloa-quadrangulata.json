    "intro": "Limnochloa quadrangulata, commonly known as the quadrangular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its four-sided stems, which give it its scientific name, and its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Limnochloa quadrangulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
