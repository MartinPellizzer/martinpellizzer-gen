It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and as a forage crop. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Lepigonum segetale is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
