    "intro": "Ligustrum expansum, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
