    "intro": "Linaria caesia var. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Linaria genus. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
