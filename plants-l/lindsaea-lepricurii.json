    "intro": "Lindsaea lepricurii, commonly known as the leprose lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lindsaea lepricurii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique botanical features."
