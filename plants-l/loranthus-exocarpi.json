    "intro": "Loranthus exocarpi, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some ecological benefits by offering shelter to small animals and insects. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are usually red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. The botanical structure of Loranthus exocarpi includes a flattened stem with specialized roots that penetrate the host's bark to establish a parasitic connection."
