    "intro": "Lobelia assurgens var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
