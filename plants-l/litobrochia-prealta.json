    "intro": "Litobrochia prealta, commonly known as the Peralta's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
