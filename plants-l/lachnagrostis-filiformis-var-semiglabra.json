    "intro": "Lachnagrostis filiformis var. semiglabra, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, thread-like leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of certain ecosystems, particularly in grassland and coastal environments."
