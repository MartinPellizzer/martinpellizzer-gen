    "intro": "Leptostemma, commonly known as blue cohosh, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America and eastern Asia. The plants typically have rhizomatous stems and are characterized by their showy, umbel-like clusters of white or blue flowers. The leaves are usually alternate, with a pinnate structure, and the fruits are berries that contain several seeds. Leptostemma species are often found in woodland habitats and are valued for their ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
