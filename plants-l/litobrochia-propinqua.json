    "intro": "Litobrochia propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed brochidium, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, cylindrical stems covered in fine, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stem for survival in arid conditions. Litobrochia propinqua is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
