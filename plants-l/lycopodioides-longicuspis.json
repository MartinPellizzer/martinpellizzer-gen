    "intro": "Lycopodioides longicuspis, commonly known as the long-needle clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Lycopodioides longicuspis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
