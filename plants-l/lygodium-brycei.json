    "intro": "Lygodium brycei, commonly known as Bryce's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns. Lygodium brycei plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
