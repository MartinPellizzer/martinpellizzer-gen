    "intro": "Lysimachia alata, commonly known as golden groundsel, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Lysimachia alata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and shaded gardens."
