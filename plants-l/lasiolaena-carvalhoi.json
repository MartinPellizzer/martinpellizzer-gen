    "intro": "Lasiolaena carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers feature a distinctive white or pale pink coloration with prominent yellow stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lasiolaena carvalhoi is considered a rare and endangered species."
