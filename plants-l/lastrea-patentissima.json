    "intro": "Lastrea patentissima, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal water. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and garden use in dry climates."
