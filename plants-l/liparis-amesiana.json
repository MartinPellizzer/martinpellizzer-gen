It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form colonies over time. Liparis amesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
