It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by attracting specific insects. Lepanthes semperflorens is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
