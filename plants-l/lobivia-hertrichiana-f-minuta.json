    "intro": "Lobivia hertrichiana f. minuta, commonly known as the miniature lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which are a characteristic adaptation to its harsh, dry environment. This cultivar is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in succulent gardens."
