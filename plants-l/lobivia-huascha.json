    "intro": "Lobivia huascha, commonly known as the Huascha lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
