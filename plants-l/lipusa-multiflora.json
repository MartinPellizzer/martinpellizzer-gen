    "intro": "Lipusa multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered lipusa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Lipusa multiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
