    "intro": "Lunaria libyca, commonly known as the Libyan moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant produces striking, pale blue or white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its seed pods are distinctive, resembling small, round lanterns, which give the plant its common name. Lunaria libyca is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a low-growing habit."
