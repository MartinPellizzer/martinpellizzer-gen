    "intro": "Lissochilus roscheri, commonly known as the Roscher's beard lily, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a raceme of small, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
