    "intro": "Lupinus lyallii subsp. washoensis, commonly known as the Wasco lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed sites. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native pollinators."
