    "intro": "Lyperodendron coccoloboides, commonly known as the Brazilian balsa tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its lightweight wood, it has been historically valued for its use in model building and as a material for insulation."
