    "intro": "Lathyrus vaniotii, commonly known as the Vaniot\u2019s vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lathyrus vaniotii is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
