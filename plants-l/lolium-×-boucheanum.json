    "intro": "Lolium \u00d7 boucheanum, commonly known as the hybrid ryegrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Lolium multiflorum (Italian ryegrass). It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, dark green foliage, which are typical of the Lolium genus. This plant is primarily cultivated as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value and rapid growth rate. However, it is not typically used for seed production because of its sterility. Lolium \u00d7 boucheanum is often used in agricultural settings to improve pasture quality and soil structure."
