It is characterized by its fibrous, spongy fruit that develops from the flower and is often used for scrubbing. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit matures to a pale yellow or greenish color and can be harvested when it is fully dry. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
