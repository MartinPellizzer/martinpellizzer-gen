    "intro": "Leaeba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Leaeba has a short lifespan, typically blooming only once every few years, making it a highly sought-after species in botanical research. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in its natural range."
