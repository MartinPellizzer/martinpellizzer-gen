    "intro": "Leptogastrodia huapingensis, commonly known as the Huaping ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, fleshy stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-blue hue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers typically bloom during the late spring or early summer, adding a rare beauty to the forest understory. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
