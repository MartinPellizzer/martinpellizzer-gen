It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the flowers bloom in shades of pink or white. Lithophragma parviflorum is adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
