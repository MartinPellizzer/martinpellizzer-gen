It belongs to the family Camelotaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated, three-lobed capsule, which aids in wind dispersal."
