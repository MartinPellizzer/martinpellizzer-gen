    "intro": "Lathyrus japonicus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods containing several seeds, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically important in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
