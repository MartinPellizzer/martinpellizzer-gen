    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. lilacinopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-lilac twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Eurasia. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year, providing a dense, carpet-like ground cover. Its most distinctive characteristic is its fragrant, bilaterally symmetrical flowers, which display a unique lilac-pink hue with purple veins. This botanical variation is highly sought after by horticulturists for its ornamental value and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
