    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus f. biflorus, commonly known as the twin-flowered grass pea, is a variant of the grass pea plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its distinctive two-flowered inflorescences, which set it apart from the typical single-flowered form. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. This variety is primarily cultivated for its edible seeds, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful processing before consumption."
