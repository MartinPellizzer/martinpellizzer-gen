    "intro": "Lespedeza paniculata, commonly known as Chinese bush clover, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of small, fluffy, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. It is also used in erosion control due to its extensive root system. Lespedeza paniculata is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
