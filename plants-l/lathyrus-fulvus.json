    "intro": "Lathyrus fulvus, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, hairy pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Lathyrus fulvus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
