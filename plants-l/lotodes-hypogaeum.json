    "intro": "Lotodes hypogaeum, commonly known as the common ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping stem that produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens and along woodland paths. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in cultivated areas."
