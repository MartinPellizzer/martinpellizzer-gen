    "intro": "Lupinus otto-kuntzeanus, commonly known as Otto Kuntze's lupine, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in rocky soils and open habitats. The plant produces tall, spindly stems with clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Lupinus otto-kuntzeanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
