    "intro": "Lupinus laxiflorus var. cognatus, commonly known as the coastal lupine, is a perennial legume native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to coastal environments with sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility, and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. This variety is notable for its ecological importance and ornamental value in coastal gardens."
