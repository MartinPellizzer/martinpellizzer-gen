    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. pendulinum, commonly known as the hanging clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its delicate, pendulous stems. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to regions of North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
