    "intro": "Lactuca mulsanti, commonly known as Mulsanti lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, spiky fruits. Native to the Mediterranean region, it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and mild, slightly bitter taste, it is occasionally cultivated for both decorative and culinary purposes."
