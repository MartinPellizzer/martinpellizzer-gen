    "intro": "Lycopodium mirabile, commonly known as the golden club, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit. It features a central, upright stem with whorled leaves that are often bright green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Lycopodium mirabile is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
