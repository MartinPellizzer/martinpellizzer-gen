    "intro": "Lysiloma brevispicatum, commonly known as the short-spined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Lysiloma brevispicatum is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
