    "intro": "Lepidium africanum var. serratum, commonly known as African peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, serrated leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. The seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
