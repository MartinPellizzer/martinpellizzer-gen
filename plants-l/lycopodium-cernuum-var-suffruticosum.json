    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to eastern North America. It forms dense, low-growing mats of foliage with small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
