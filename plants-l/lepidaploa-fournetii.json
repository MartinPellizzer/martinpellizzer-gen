    "intro": "Lepidaploa fournetii, commonly known as the Fournet's lepidaploa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
