    "intro": "Loranthus obliquus, commonly known as the oblique mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to Australia and is considered a common but ecologically significant component of its ecosystem."
