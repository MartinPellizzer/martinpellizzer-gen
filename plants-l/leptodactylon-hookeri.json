    "intro": "Leptodactylon hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's sword fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
