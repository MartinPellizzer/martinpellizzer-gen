    "intro": "Loranthus caudiciflorus, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. It has a short, thick stem known as a caudex, from which the branches emerge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting birdlife and its traditional use in folk medicine."
