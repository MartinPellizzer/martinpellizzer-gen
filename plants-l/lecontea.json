    "intro": "Lecontea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of only two species, Lecontea alba and Lecontea micrantha, both native to the southeastern United States. These plants are characterized by their delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. They are often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, typically growing as low shrubs. The genus is named in honor of the botanist John Le Conte, who made significant contributions to the study of North American flora."
