    "intro": "Lycopodium dichaeoides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves and produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores. Lycopodium dichaeoides is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and its ability to form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate and tropical ecosystems."
