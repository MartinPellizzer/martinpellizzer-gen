    "intro": "Leucopogon cochlearifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed heath, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandhill habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps it conserve water in its arid environment. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
