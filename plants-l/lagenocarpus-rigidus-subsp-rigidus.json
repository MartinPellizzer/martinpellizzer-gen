    "intro": "Lagenocarpus rigidus subsp. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid burr sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-angled spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the plant is often found in dense stands. Lagenocarpus rigidus subsp. rigidus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
