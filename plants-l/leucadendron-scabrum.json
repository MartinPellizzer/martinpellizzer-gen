    "intro": "Leucadendron scabrum, commonly known as the scabrous leucadendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to South Africa, particularly the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and striking cone-shaped flower heads, which range in color from yellow to orange. It is a hardy shrub that is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Leucadendron scabrum plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
