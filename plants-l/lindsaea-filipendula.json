    "intro": "Lindsaea filipendula, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Lindsaea filipendula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in tropical gardens."
