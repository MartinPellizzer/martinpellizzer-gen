    "intro": "Lepturus incurvatus subsp. filiformis, commonly known as the slender-leaved lepturus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale green or yellowish hue. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
