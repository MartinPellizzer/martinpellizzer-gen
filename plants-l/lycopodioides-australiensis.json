    "intro": "Lycopodioides australiensis, commonly known as the Australian clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and spore-producing cones. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the base of the plant, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Lycopodioides australiensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
