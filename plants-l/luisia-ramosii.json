It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often branch out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
