    "intro": "Listera caurina, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to the forest floor. Listera caurina is known for its ability to thrive in cool, damp conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
