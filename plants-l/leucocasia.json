    "intro": "Leucocasia, commonly known as the white senna, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Leucocasia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Additionally, they play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in their native habitats."
