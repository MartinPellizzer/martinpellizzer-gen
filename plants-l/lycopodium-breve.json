    "intro": "Lycopodium breve, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium breve plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
