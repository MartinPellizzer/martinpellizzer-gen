    "intro": "Lycopodioides pectinata, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes with spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical cones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, contributing to its survival in humid, temperate climates."
