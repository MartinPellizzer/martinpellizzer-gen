    "intro": "Lobelia cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces spikes of blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Lobelia cardiophylla is an important species for pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
