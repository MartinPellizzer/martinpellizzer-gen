It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above water. The plant has slender, branching stems and is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. This variety is often found in shallow, freshwater areas and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
