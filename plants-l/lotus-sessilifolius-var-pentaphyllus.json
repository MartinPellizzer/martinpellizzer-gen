    "intro": "Lotus sessilifolius var. pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leaf water lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots system helps stabilize the sediment in aquatic environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in wetland habitats."
