    "intro": "Luzula spicata var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf woodrush, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and grass-like leaves that are broader than those of typical Luzula species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize suitable habitats effectively."
