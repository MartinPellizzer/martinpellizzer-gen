    "intro": "Leucheria candidissima f. subintegra, commonly known as the white-leaved marsh plant, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
