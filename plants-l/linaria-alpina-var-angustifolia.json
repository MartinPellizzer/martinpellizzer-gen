    "intro": "Linaria alpina var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
