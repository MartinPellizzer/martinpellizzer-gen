    "intro": "Lychnophora ericoides, commonly known as the Brazilian heather, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for its ornamental and potential medicinal value."
