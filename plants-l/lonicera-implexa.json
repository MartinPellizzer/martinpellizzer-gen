    "intro": "Lonicera implexa, commonly known as the twisted honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which ripen in autumn, are orange-red and edible for humans and birds. Lonicera implexa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
