It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
