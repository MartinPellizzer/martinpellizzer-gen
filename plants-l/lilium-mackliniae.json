    "intro": "Lilium mackliniae, commonly known as the Macklin's lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, forming a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
