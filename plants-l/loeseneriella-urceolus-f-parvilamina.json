    "intro": "Loeseneriella urceolus f. parvilamina, commonly known as the small-lipped water clover, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often arranged in a rosette formation. The plant belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are typically small, rounded, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The inflorescence consists of small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This plant is often found in slow-moving waters and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
