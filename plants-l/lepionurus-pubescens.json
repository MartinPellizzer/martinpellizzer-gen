    "intro": "Lepionurus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lepionurus, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and has small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a mild, aromatic scent. Lepionurus pubescens is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
