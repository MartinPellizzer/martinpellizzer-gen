    "intro": "Leucopoa spectabilis subsp. croatica, commonly known as the Croatian leucopoa, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
