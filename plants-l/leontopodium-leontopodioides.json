    "intro": "Leontopodium leontopodioides, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments with poor soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its beauty and association with alpine landscapes, it is often cultivated in gardens and is a symbol of resilience and purity."
