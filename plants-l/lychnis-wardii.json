    "intro": "Lychnis wardii, commonly known as the Ward's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and showy pink or red flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of small, delicate flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Lychnis wardii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments."
