    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum subsp. appressum, commonly known as the creeping flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Linum suffruticosum subsp. appressum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
