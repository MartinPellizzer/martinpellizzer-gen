    "intro": "Leontodon reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries."
