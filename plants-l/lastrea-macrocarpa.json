    "intro": "Lastrea macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant produces large, elongated fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive dry conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
