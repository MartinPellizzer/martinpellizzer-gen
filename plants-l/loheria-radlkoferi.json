    "intro": "Loheria radlkoferi, commonly known as the dwarf loheria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers. The plant typically produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
