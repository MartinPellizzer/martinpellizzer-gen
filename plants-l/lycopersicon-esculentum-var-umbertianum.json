    "intro": "Lycopersicon esculentum var. umbertianum, commonly known as the Umbertian tomato, is a botanical variant of the domesticated tomato. It is characterized by its unique fruit morphology, which includes a distinctive umbrelliform shape and a vibrant coloration that ranges from deep red to orange. This variety is native to South America and has been selectively bred for its ornamental and culinary uses. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are yellow and five-petaled, typical of the Solanaceae family, and it produces fruits that are smaller and more flavorful compared to standard tomatoes."
