It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Flax is particularly noted for its fibrous stalks, which have been used historically for textile production. Additionally, the seeds are a source of oil and are used in food and medicine."
