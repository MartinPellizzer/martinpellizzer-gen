    "intro": "Lophocereus melanurus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Lophocereus melanurus is well adapted to desert conditions, with a shallow root system and a slow growth rate."
