    "intro": "Lepisorus macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Lepisorus macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
