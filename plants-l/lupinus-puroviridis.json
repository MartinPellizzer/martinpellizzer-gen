    "intro": "Lupinus puroviridis, commonly known as the greenleaf lupine, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright green to yellowish-blue flowers. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus puroviridis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
