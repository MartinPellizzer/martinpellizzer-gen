    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. discolor, commonly known as the white twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow of the species, and its small, opposite leaves. The plant is a low-growing evergreen shrub, often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. This rare form is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and limited distribution."
