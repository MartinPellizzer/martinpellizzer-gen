    "intro": "Liquidambar caudata, commonly known as the fragrant sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged alternately along the stems and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Liquidambar caudata is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
