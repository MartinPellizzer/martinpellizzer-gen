    "intro": "Lignonia, commonly known as the evergreen shrub, is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and heathers. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage that retains its color throughout the year. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Lignonia produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate regions."
