    "intro": "Labatia euryphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf labatia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments, such as swamps and marshes, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in humid conditions. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
