It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like seed pods and vibrant yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
