    "intro": "Lophiolepis adunca subsp. bashkalensis, commonly known as the Bashkhalensis lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific alpine and subalpine regions. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure and chemical composition. The lichen typically grows on rock surfaces and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its morphology includes a crustose or foliose growth form, with a distinct coloration that varies depending on the substrate. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator species for studying alpine ecosystems."
