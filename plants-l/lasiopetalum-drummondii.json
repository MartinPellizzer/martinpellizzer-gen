It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is typically found in open habitats such as heathlands and sandplains, and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
