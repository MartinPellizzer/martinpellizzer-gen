    "intro": "Lindernia exilis, commonly known as the slender lindernia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Lindernia exilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
