    "intro": "Lindera fragrans, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a fragrant, glandular underside that releases a spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Lindera fragrans is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and wildlife benefits, as it attracts pollinators and provides food for birds."
