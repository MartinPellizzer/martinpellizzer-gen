    "intro": "Loranthus aucklandicus, commonly known as the Auckland mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily pines and other conifers. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that are often overlooked. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries. This species is native to New Zealand and plays a unique role in the local ecosystem as both a parasite and a food source for wildlife."
