It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a compact, rounded shape with spiny stems that store water, typical of cacti. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. Levieria nitens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
