    "intro": "Littorella uniflora var. americana, commonly known as American sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, often found in intertidal zones and along rocky shores. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
