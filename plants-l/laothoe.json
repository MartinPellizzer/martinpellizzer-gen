    "intro": "Laothoe, commonly known as the moonflower, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers have a unique structure with a prominent, showy corolla that blooms in a single night. Laothoe is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting biodiversity in nighttime ecosystems."
