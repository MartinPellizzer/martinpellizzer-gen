    "intro": "Lepidagathis sericea, commonly known as silky lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in terminal or axillary clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
