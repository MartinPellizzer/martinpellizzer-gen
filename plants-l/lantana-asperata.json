    "intro": "Lantana asperata, commonly known as rough lantana, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, red, and purple. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, giving the plant its common name, and they are opposite in arrangement along the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Lantana asperata is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its showy blooms."
