    "intro": "Limoniopsis, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. These plants are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. Limoniopsis species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the green sepals. The plants typically grow as herbaceous perennials, producing small, linear leaves and often forming dense clusters. Due to their ornamental value and unique appearance, some species of Limoniopsis are cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
