    "intro": "Lepanthes doloma, commonly known as the Dolomita orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Lepanthes doloma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
