It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. Lasiandra obscura is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
