    "intro": "Lindera robusta, commonly known as roughleaf ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its rough-textured, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Lindera robusta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
