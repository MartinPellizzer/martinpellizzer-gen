    "intro": "Lagenocarpus comatus, commonly known as the hairy pod grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with elongated, hairy spikes that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed sites effectively."
