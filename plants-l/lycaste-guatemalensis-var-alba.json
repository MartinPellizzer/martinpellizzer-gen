    "intro": "Lycaste guatemalensis var. alba, commonly known as the white Guatemalan lycaste, is a rare and striking orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom on sturdy, upright stems. The plant has broad, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a lush green backdrop to its floral display. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively low maintenance requirements."
