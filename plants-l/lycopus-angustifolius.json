    "intro": "Lycopus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
