    "intro": "Leymus salina var. salmonis, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of salt-tolerant vegetation. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
