It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a hairy surface. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Lepidium pratense."
