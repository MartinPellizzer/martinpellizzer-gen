    "intro": "Lamium album subsp. barbatum, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively, and its flowers are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported soothing properties."
