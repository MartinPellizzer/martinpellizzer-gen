It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or aquatic environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic habitat. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Limnophila borealis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
