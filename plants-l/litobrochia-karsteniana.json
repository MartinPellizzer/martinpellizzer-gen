    "intro": "Litobrochia karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's rock lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark yellowish-green, and it produces distinct, rounded apothecia with a smooth, often reddish margin. It is a chemically complex lichen, containing various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure."
