    "intro": "Lonicera hispidula var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in the spring, typically yellow or orange, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, mature in the fall and are an important food source for birds. This species is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
