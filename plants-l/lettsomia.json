    "intro": "Lettsomia, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its unique ability to open its flowers only during the evening. Lettsomia has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in warm climates."
