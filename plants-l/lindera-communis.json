    "intro": "Lindera communis, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. The berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
