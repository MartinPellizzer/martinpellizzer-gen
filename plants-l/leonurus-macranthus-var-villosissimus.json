    "intro": "Leonurus macranthus var. villosissimus, commonly known as the hairy betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and tonic properties."
