    "intro": "Linociera riparia, commonly known as the river willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, simple leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Linociera riparia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
