    "intro": "Lonicera subspicata var. typica, commonly known as the common honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, appearing in clusters. These flowers give way to red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
