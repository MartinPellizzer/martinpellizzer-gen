    "intro": "Leuzea altaica, commonly known as Siberian leuzea, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Leuzea altaica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
