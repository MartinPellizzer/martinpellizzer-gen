    "intro": "Lindera venosa, commonly known as the veined ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, and usually ovate to elliptic leaves with prominent veins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural landscapes."
