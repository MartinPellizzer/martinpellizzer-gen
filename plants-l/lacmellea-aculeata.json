    "intro": "Lacmellea aculeata, commonly known as the spiny green alga, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically lobed and covered with small, spiny projections called aculei. This plant thrives in marine environments, particularly in tide pools and rocky substrates along coastlines. Its structure allows it to absorb nutrients efficiently from the surrounding water. Lacmellea aculeata plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
