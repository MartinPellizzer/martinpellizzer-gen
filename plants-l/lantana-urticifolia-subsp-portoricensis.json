    "intro": "Lantana urticifolia subsp. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican lantana, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various tropical and subtropical environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
