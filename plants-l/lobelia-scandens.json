    "intro": "Lobelia scandens, commonly known as climbing lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its slender, vine-like stems allow it to climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. Lobelia scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
