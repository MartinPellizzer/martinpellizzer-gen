    "intro": "Lindsaea marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesas lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Marquesas Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Lindsaea marquesensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
