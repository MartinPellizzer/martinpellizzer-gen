It features slender, linear leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
