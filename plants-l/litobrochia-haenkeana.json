    "intro": "Litobrochia haenkeana, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Litobrochia haenkeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
