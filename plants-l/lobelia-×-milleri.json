It is a hybrid between *Lobelia sanguinea* and *Lobelia cardinalis*, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dark green, narrow leaves and showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. Lobelia \u00d7 milleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
