    "intro": "Lobelia fenestralis, commonly known as the fen window lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lobelia fenestralis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
