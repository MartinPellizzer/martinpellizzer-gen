    "intro": "Leptoglottis subinermis, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically erect and unbranched. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Leptoglottis subinermis is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
