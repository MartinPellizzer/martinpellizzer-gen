    "intro": "Laurus carolinensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the Southern waxleaf laurel, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive foliage. The varietal form, pubescens, distinguishes it from the more commonly known Laurus carolinensis, which lacks the hairy leaf texture."
