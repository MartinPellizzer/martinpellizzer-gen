    "intro": "Leptospermum polygalifolium subsp. tropicum, commonly known as the tropical tea tree, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a warm, dry climate. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally for its potential medicinal and aromatic benefits."
