    "intro": "Lastrea roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima lastrea, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular inflorescence that displays a range of colors from orange to red. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky substrates. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts."
