    "intro": "Lindsaea schizoloma, commonly known as the split-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, pinnate leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Lindsaea schizoloma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
