It features a compact, globular frond structure, which gives it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous small, spore-producing sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental use."
