    "intro": "Lippia micromera var. paludicola, commonly known as swamp lippia, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in South America. It typically grows in marshy or seasonally flooded areas, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments. Due to its habitat preferences, it is less commonly cultivated but holds potential for ecological restoration projects."
