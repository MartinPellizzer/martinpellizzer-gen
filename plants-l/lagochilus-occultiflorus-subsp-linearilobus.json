    "intro": "Lagochilus occultiflorus subsp. linearilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed rock hyssop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in dense spikes. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
