    "intro": "Launaea cabrae, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant has a creeping growth habit with succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Launaea cabrae is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
