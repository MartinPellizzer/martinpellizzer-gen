The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, pinnately lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are small and contained within siliques, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Lepidium angolense is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
