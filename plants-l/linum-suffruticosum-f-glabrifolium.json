    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum f. glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved flax, is a variant of the flax plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy stems and smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often glabrous, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its ornamental value and historical significance in textile production make it a notable species in botanical studies."
