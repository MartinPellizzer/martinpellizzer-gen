    "intro": "Linaria fastigiata, commonly known as the upright toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Linaria fastigiata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is a perennial species that can spread through self-seeding, making it a hardy and resilient addition to rock gardens or borders."
