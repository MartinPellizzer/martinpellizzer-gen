    "intro": "Leontodon froedinii, commonly known as the Froedini's hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a basal rosette of linear, gray-green leaves and produces yellow ray florets surrounded by numerous disk florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
