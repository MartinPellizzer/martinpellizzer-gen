    "intro": "Linaria filifolia var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky hairplant, is a variant of the hairplant species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, filamentous foliage that secretes a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow-orange flowers appear in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise subdued appearance. This variety is often cultivated for its unique texture and resilience in dry conditions."
