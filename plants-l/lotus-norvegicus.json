    "intro": "Lotus norvegicus, commonly known as the Norwegian lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of Europe. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near rivers and lakes. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are large, showy, and usually pink or red, with a distinctive pattern of darker veins. Lotus norvegicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been historically used in traditional medicine."
