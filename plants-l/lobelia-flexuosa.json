    "intro": "Lobelia flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. The plant features slender, twisting stems that give it its common name, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often slightly hairy. Its showy, blue to purple flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Lobelia flexuosa is valued in native gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
