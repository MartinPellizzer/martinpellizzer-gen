    "intro": "Limodorum candidum, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dark green, elliptical leaves with a waxy texture and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is characterized by its toxic sap, which contains various alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its medicinal and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though with caution."
