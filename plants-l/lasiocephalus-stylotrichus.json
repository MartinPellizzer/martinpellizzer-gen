    "intro": "Lasiocephalus stylotrichus, commonly known as the silky-headed grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, typical of many grass species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
