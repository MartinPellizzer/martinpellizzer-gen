    "intro": "Limonium portovecchiense, commonly known as the Alaskan sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in salty and windy conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium portovecchiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
