    "intro": "Luisia diglipurensis, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming a unique epiphytic relationship with its host. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, misty environment. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Luisia diglipurensis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
