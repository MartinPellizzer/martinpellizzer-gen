    "intro": "Lobularia intermedia var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sweet pea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its continuous blooming throughout the growing season."
