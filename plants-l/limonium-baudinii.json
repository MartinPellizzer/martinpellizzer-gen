    "intro": "Limonium baudinii, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Limonium baudinii is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
