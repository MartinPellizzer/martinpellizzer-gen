    "intro": "Lindsaea concinna var. kusukusensis, commonly known as the Kusukus Island lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and possesses long, narrow, and leathery leaves that form a rosette. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of many bromeliads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
