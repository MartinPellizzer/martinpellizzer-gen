    "intro": "Larix dahurica var. cajanderi, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and its needle-like leaves turn a striking golden yellow before falling in autumn. Its wood is lightweight and durable, making it valuable for construction and paper production. This variety is also noted for its resilience to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
