    "intro": "Linaria ambigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces seeds in small capsules that are dispersed by wind. Linaria ambigua is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
