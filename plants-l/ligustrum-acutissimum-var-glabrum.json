    "intro": "Ligustrum acutissimum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth privet, is a shrub native to southern China. It features small, oval leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is often used in landscaping due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
