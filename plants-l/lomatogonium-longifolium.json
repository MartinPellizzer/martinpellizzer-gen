    "intro": "Lomatogonium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved lomatogonium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and attract various pollinators."
