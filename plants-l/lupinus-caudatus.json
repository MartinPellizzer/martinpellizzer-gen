    "intro": "Lupinus caudatus, commonly known as the tall lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Lupinus caudatus is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
