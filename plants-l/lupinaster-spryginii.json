    "intro": "Lupinaster spryginii, commonly known as the Siberian lupin, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Lupinaster spryginii is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
