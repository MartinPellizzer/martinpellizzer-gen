    "intro": "Lycopodium subfalciforme, commonly known as the narrow-sheath clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
