    "intro": "Lagerstroemia moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan roseum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Moluccas in Indonesia. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that appear in summer, which are actually modified leaves rather than true petals. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Lagerstroemia moluccana is relatively low-maintenance and adaptable to various soil types, making it a popular choice for gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
