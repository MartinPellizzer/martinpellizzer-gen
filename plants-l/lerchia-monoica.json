    "intro": "Lerchia monoica, commonly known as the single-stemmed orchid, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its solitary, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers typically bloom in spring and are notable for their intricate, often violet or purple hues. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Lerchia monoica is considered a rare and endangered species."
