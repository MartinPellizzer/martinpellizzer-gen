    "intro": "Lindsaea hemiglossa, commonly known as the silver mist fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a soft, velvety texture that helps it retain water in humid environments. Lindsaea hemiglossa is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in the canopy of tropical rainforests."
