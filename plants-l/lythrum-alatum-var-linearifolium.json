    "intro": "Lythrum alatum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rosemary bush, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, with lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces spikes of showy pink or purple flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
