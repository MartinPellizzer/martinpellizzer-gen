    "intro": "Lithops elisabethiae, commonly known as the \"Living Stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot. Lithops elisabethiae is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
