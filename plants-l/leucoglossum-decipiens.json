    "intro": "Leucoglossum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive white-lipped orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and its unique, showy flowers that resemble small, white lips. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
