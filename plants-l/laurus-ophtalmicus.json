    "intro": "Laurus ophtalmicus, commonly known as the eye laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its aromatic evergreen leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though they are less common than those of the more widely known laurel species. The plant's botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable addition to both ornamental and culinary gardens."
