It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
