    "intro": "Lecointea tango, commonly known as the Tango orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that resemble the hues of a tango dance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain water in its humid, shaded environment. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, it is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
