    "intro": "Loxogramme latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, floating leaves that are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant has slender, branching fronds that help it spread across the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and water gardens."
