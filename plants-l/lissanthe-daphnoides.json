It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Lissanthe daphnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
