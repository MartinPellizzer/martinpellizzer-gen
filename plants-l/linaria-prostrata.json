    "intro": "Linaria prostrata, commonly known as creeping toadflax, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Linaria prostrata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
