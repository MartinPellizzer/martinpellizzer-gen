    "intro": "Lamium alpestre, commonly known as alpine deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features oval, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish underside, and it produces small, two-lipped, pink or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, humid conditions. Lamium alpestre is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat ailments such as sore throats and skin irritations."
