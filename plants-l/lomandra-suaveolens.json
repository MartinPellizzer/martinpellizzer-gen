    "intro": "Lomandra suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, which are highly attractive to birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in native landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Lomandra suaveolens is also valued for its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade conditions."
