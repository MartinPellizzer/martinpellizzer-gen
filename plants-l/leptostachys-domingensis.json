    "intro": "Leptostachys domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
