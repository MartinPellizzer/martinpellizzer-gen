    "intro": "Lestibudesia spicata, commonly known as the spiky leaf plant, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with dense, spiny leaves that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often inconspicuous, with the showy bracts attracting pollinators. Its roots are known to exude a milky sap, a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. Lestibudesia spicata is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions."
