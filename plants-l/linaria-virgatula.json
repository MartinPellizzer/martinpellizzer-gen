    "intro": "Linaria virgatula, commonly known as the zigzag toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Linaria virgatula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. It is a perennial species that can form dense colonies, making it both a decorative plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
