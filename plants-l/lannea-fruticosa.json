    "intro": "Lannea fruticosa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Lannea fruticosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in tropical and subtropical regions. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
