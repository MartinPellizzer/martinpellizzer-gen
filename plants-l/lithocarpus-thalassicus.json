    "intro": "Lithocarpus thalassicus, commonly known as the sea chestnut, is a species of evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain a single seed, and its leaves are typically\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and glossy. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests near the coast. Due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
