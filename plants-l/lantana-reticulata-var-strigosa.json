It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.
