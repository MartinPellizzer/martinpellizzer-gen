    "intro": "Loranthus tribracteatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Rutaceae and Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its fruits are typically red or yellow berries containing one or two seeds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa."
