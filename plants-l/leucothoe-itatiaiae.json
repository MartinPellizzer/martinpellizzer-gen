    "intro": "Leucothoe itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia leatherwood, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and ecological role."
