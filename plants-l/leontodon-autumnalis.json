    "intro": "Leontodon autumnalis, commonly known as autumn leontodon, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, producing yellow-orange flower heads that attract pollinators. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinct central vein."
