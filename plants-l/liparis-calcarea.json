    "intro": "Liparis calcarea, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in calcareous soils, thriving in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant features a short, upright stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green or white. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its ability to adapt to nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
