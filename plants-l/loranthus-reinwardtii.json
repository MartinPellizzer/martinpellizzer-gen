    "intro": "Loranthus reinwardtii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruits are typically small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa."
