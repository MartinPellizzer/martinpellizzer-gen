    "intro": "Lobelia puberula f. argutidentata, commonly known as the hairy lobelia, is a variant of the lobelia species characterized by its hairy foliage and distinctive floral morphology. It is a herbaceous perennial native to certain regions of North America, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple, arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. This cultivar is often valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
