    "intro": "Lysimachia cephalantha, commonly known as golden thread, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Lysimachia cephalantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
