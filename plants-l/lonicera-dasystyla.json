    "intro": "Lonicera dasystyla, commonly known as the broad-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in early spring. Its berries are red and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed as those of other honeysuckle species. Lonicera dasystyla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
