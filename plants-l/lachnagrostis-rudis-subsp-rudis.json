    "intro": "Lachnagrostis rudis subsp. rudis, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and typically have a bluish-green hue. Lachnagrostis rudis subsp. rudis is often found in moist, nutrient-poor soils, such as those in wet meadows and marshy areas."
