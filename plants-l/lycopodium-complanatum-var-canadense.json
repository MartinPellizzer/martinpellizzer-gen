    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. canadense, commonly known as the Canadian clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the stems, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This variety is often found in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of woodland habitats."
