    "intro": "Loxoscaphe theciferum var. cornutum, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates for nutrition. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent. The unique morphology and trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
