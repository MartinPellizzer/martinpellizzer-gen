    "intro": "Leucheria gilliesii, commonly known as the mountain fuchsia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
