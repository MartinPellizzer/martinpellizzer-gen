    "intro": "Leptalix pannosa, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, woolly coating of vegetative structures. It typically grows on rock surfaces in temperate and alpine regions, forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungal component and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. The plant's thallus is usually grayish-green to brownish in color, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is often found in shaded, moist habitats where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Leptalix pannosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
