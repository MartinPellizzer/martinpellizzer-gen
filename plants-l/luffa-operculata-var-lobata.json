    "intro": "Luffa operculata var. lobata, commonly known as the horned sponge gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and distinctive, inflated fruit that resembles a sponge. The fruit develops from a modified calyx and is used both as a vegetable and for sponge-like applications after drying. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires full sun and well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its edible young fruits and its fibrous, spongy mature fruit."
