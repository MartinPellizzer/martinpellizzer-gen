    "intro": "Leucorchis albida f. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine white orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas where it can receive sufficient sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
