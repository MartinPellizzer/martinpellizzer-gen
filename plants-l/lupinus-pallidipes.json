It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus pallidipes is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open grasslands and rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plant species in its habitat."
