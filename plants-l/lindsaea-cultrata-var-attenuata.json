    "intro": "Lindsaea cultrata var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often slightly curved. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The varietal form, attenuata, distinguishes itself by having more elongated and tapering leaves compared to the typical form."
