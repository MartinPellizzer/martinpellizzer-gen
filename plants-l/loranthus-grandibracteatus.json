    "intro": "Loranthus grandibracteatus, commonly known as the large-bract mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense forest canopies."
