    "intro": "Loranthus hillianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically the neem tree. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
