    "intro": "Lomatium grayi, commonly known as Gray's lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Lomatium grayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native ecosystem."
