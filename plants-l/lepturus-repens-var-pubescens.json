    "intro": "Lepturus repens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy trailing bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a spreading growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with five lobes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variety is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland edges and meadows."
