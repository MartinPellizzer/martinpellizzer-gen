    "intro": "Lycopodium eversum, commonly known as the evergreen clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive cycle involves the production of spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many ancient plant species. Lycopodium eversum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
