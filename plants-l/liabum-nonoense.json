It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
