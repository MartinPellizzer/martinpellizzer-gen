    "intro": "Leucothoe crassifolia var. subevenia, commonly known as the Appalachian leatherleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green, elliptical leaves that are leathery in texture and often have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark blue, elliptical berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained acidic soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form thickets in woodland settings."
