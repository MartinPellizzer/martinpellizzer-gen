    "intro": "Lupinus myrianthus, commonly known as the many-flowered lupin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features erect, branching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late summer. Its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Lupinus myrianthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in gardens and restoration projects."
