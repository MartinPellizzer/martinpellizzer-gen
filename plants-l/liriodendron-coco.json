    "intro": "Liriodendron coco, commonly known as the Cuban tulip tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow-green flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth margin, often with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain two winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
