    "intro": "Loranthus subulatus, commonly known as the needle-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region. It has small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by red berries that are a source of food for birds. Its parasitic nature means it derives water and nutrients from its host, often causing stress to the host tree. Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Loranthus subulatus plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting bird populations through its fruit."
