    "intro": "Lingoum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf lingoum, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
