    "intro": "Leptoglottis occidentalis, commonly known as the western reedgrass, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among grass species. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
