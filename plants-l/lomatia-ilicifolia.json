    "intro": "Lomatia ilicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and dry forests, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal. Lomatia ilicifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
