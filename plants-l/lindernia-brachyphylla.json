It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Lindernia brachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
