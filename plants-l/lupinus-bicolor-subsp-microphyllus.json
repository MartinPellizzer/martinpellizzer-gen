    "intro": "Lupinus bicolor subsp. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces dense clusters of pea-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes."
