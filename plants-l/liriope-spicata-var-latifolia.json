    "intro": "Liriope spicata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lilyturf, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than those of the typical Liriope spicata, giving it a more ornamental appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. This variety is valued for its ability to form dense ground cover and its adaptability to a range of environmental conditions."
