    "intro": "Lactuca henryi, commonly known as Henry's lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and basal rosette of leaves. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly bitter taste, similar to other lettuces in the genus Lactuca. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
