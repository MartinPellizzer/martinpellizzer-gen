It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides. It has a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to support itself on other plants or structures. The seeds are contained in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
