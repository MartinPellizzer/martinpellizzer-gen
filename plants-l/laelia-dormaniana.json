    "intro": "Laelia dormaniana, commonly known as the Dorman's orchid, is a species native to the high altitudes of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its harsh mountainous environment. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. It prefers cool, humid conditions with good air circulation and partial shade. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
