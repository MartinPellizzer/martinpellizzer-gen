    "intro": "Linaria ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of the common toadflax, with two lips and five stamens. Linaria ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
