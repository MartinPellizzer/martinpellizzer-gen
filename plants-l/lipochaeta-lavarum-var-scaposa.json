It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often found in coastal regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of local flora and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
