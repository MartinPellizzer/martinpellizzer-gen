    "intro": "Linaria alpina proles benearnensis, commonly known as the Benearn Alpine toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the plant family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have four petals that are often marked with distinctive patterns. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its harsh environment."
