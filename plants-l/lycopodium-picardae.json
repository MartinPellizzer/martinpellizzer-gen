    "intro": "Lycopodium picardae, commonly known as the Picard's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium picardae is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
