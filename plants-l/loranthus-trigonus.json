    "intro": "Loranthus trigonus, commonly known as the three-angled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant has a distinctive triangular or three-angled stem, which gives it its scientific name. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating further spread."
