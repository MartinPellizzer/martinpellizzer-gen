    "intro": "Lamourouxia viejensis, commonly known as the Viejensis fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that exhibit a distinctive dichotomous branching pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lamourouxia viejensis is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems."
