It features elliptical to rhomboid-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
