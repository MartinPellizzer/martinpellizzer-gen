    "intro": "Lisianthius nigrescens, commonly known as the black lisianthium, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet forest habitats, often at high elevations, and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and it has a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
