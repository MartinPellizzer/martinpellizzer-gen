    "intro": "Limonium pylium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or seaside cliffs. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils. Limonium pylium is also used in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
