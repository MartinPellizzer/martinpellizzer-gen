    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium emeiense, commonly known as the Emei Mountain water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures are concealed within spore-producing capsules, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
