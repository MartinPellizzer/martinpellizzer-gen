    "intro": "Leersia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf cutgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than an inch wide, with a smooth, grassy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
