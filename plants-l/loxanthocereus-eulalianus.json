    "intro": "Loxanthocereus eulalianus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its green, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for desert gardens and botanical collections."
