    "intro": "Linnaea, commonly known as the twinflower, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, opposite leaves that are oval-shaped and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in pairs, giving it its common name. Linnaea is part of the family Primulaceae and is often found in shaded forest environments. Its botanical name, Linnaea borealis, honors Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy."
