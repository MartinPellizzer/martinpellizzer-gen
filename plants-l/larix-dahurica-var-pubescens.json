    "intro": "Larix dahurica var. pubescens, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is often reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
