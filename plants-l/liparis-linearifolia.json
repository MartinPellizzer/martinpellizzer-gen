    "intro": "Liparis linearifolia, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Liparis linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
