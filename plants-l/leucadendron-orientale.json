    "intro": "Leucadendron orientale, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange cone-like flowers in the summer months, which are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
