    "intro": "Luzula forsteri var. rhizomata, commonly known as the rhizomatous wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and are pollinated by wind, typical of many Cyperaceae species."
