    "intro": "Limonium oristanum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in coastal and saline environments. The plant produces spikes of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Limonium oristanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
