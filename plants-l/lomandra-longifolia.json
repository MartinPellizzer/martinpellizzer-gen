    "intro": "Lomandra longifolia, commonly known as the grassland lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers in spring. Lomandra longifolia is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
