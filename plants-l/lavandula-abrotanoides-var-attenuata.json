    "intro": "Lavandula abrotanoides var. attenuata, commonly known as narrow-leaved lavender, is a compact, shrubby perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray, linear leaves and produces spikes of fragrant, pale purple to blue-lilac flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal remedies. This variety is closely related to other lavender species but is distinguished by its narrower foliage and smaller flower clusters."
