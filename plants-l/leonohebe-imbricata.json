    "intro": "Leonohebe imbricata, commonly known as the silverweed or rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Leonohebe imbricata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments."
