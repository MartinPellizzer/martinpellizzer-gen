    "intro": "Licuala bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are distinctly divided into two lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near rivers or in dense forests. Its trunk is short and stout, with a fibrous outer covering. Licuala bifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
