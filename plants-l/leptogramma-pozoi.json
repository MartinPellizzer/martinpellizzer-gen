    "intro": "Leptogramma pozoi, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy structures. Leptogramma pozoi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
