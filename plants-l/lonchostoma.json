    "intro": "Lonchostoma, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic flowering plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day. They are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The leaves are usually thick and waxy, which helps them stay afloat and resist water loss. Their flowers exhibit a unique daily blooming pattern, opening in the morning and closing at night."
