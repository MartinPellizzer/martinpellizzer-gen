    "intro": "Lycoctonum ochranthum, commonly known as the red-veined nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features strikingly ornamental foliage with deep green leaves that have prominent red veins, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, often containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. However, it is important to note that all parts of this plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
