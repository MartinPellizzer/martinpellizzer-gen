    "intro": "Lithraea molleoides, commonly known as the silky tree or silky ash, is a small evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Lithraea molleoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and conservation areas."
