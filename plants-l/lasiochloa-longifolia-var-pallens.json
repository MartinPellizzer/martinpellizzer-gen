    "intro": "Lasiochloa longifolia var. pallens, commonly known as the pale lasiochloa, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
