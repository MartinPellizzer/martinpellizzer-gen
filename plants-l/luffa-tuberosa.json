    "intro": "Luffa tuberosa, commonly known as the sponge gourd or loofah, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its fibrous, spongy interior that develops from the mature fruit, making it useful for exfoliation. The plant produces large, lobed leaves and yellow flowers, which are typical of the gourd family. Its growth habit involves trailing or climbing vines that can reach several meters in length. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, allowing the fibrous material to dry and become usable as a natural sponge."
