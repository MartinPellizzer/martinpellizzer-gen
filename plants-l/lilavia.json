It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady areas and has a strong, somewhat unpleasant odor. Lilavia is known for its medicinal properties, though it is toxic to humans and animals if ingested in large quantities. Its historical use in herbal medicine dates back to ancient times."
