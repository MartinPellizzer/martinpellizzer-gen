It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Linaria nummularia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
