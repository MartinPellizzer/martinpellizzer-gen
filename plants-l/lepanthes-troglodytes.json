    "intro": "Lepanthes troglodytes, commonly known as the cave orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in caves or rocky crevices. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants rather than in soil. Lepanthes troglodytes is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
