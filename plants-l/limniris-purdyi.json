    "intro": "Limniris purdyi, commonly known as the Purdy's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrates of still or slow-moving waters. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Limniris purdyi is considered endangered in its native range."
