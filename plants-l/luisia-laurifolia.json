It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Luisia laurifolia is well adapted to acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and hammocks."
