    "intro": "Lepidium atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its fruits are tiny, dry pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lepidium atlanticum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions."
