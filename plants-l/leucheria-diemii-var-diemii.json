    "intro": "Leucheria diemii var. diemii, commonly known as the Diemii leucheria, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
