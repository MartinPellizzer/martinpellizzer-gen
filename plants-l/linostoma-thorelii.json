    "intro": "Linostoma thorelii, commonly known as the Thorel's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure, which is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Linostoma thorelii is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate and boreal regions. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for ecological studies."
