    "intro": "Lactuca leptocephala, commonly known as the slender lettuce or small-leaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous appearance with finely divided, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by oval, pale green to brown seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats. Lactuca leptocephala is sometimes cultivated as a leafy vegetable, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce varieties."
