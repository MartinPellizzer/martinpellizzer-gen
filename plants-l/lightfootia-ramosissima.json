    "intro": "Lightfootia ramosissima, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Lightfootia ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
