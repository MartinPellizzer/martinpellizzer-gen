    "intro": "Lepidium montanum var. cinereum, commonly known as the gray shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous species. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble a shepherd's purse. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at higher elevations. The grayish hue of its foliage is due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions."
