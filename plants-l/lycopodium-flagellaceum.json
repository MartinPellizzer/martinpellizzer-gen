    "intro": "Lycopodium flagellaceum, commonly known as the flagellate clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium flagellaceum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
