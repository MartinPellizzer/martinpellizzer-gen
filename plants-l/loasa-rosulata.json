    "intro": "Loasa rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Loasa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
