    "intro": "Lithophila muscoides, commonly known as the rock moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found growing on rocks, tree trunks, or soil in temperate regions. This plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flattened, leaf-like body that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Lithophila muscoides plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
