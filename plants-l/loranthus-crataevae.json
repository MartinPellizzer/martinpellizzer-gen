    "intro": "Loranthus crataevae, commonly known as the dogwood dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily members of the Cornaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fruit, aiding in its spread. Loranthus crataevae is often found in temperate regions and can be a common sight in forested areas."
