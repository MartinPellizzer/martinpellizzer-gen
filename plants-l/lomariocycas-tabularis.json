    "intro": "Lomariocycas tabularis, commonly known as the flat-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery leaves that grow in a fan-like arrangement. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically found on separate plants. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
