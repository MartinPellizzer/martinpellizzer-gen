    "intro": "Limonium gueneri, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Limonium gueneri is often used in coastal gardens due to its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. It is also popular in floral arrangements for its long-lasting blooms and unique appearance."
