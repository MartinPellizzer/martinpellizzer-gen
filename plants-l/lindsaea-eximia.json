    "intro": "Lindsaea eximia, commonly known as the shining maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often have a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Lindsaea eximia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
