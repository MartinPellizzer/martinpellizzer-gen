    "intro": "Lindsaea spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that often form dense, cascading clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and covered in small, spinulose projections, which give it its scientific name. Lindsaea spinulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
