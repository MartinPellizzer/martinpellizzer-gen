    "intro": "Lessertia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower lessertia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. It is a small shrub native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Lessertia uniflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
