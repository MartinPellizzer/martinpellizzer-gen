    "intro": "Lithocarpus pseudosundaicus, commonly known as the Sunda's ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range."
