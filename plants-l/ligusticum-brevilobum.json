    "intro": "Ligusticum brevilobum, commonly known as the western cowparsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum brevilobum thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges."
