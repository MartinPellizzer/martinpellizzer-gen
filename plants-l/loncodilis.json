    "intro": "Loncodilis, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Loncodilis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
