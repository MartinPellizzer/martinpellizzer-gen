    "intro": "Lobelia limoselloides, commonly known as the marsh lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Lobelia limoselloides is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
