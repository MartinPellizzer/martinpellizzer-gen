    "intro": "Latourorchis leucohybos, commonly known as the white-tongued orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soils of its habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for both botanists and horticulturists."
