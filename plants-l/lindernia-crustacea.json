    "intro": "Lindernia crustacea, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive crinkled texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
