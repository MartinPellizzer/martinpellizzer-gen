    "intro": "Lotus fruticulosus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a sprawling growth habit with a fibrous root system and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with hairy surfaces, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically borne on long peduncles and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lotus fruticulosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
