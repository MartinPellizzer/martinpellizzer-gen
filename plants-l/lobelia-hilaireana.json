    "intro": "Lobelia hilaireana, commonly known as Hilaire's lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
