    "intro": "Lycium humile, commonly known as the dwarf wolfberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. The plant has small, leathery leaves and is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it blooms in the spring. Lycium humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environments."
