    "intro": "Lepanthes micropogon, commonly known as the small-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus Lepanthes is known for its diverse floral morphology, and L. micropogon is no exception."
