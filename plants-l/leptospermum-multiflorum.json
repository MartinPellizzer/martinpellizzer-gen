    "intro": "Leptospermum multiflorum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or coastal habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common feature of coastal landscapes. Its aromatic foliage has been traditionally used in herbal remedies and as a source of essential oils."
