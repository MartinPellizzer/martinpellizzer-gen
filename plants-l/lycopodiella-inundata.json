    "intro": "Lycopodiella inundata, commonly known as the water huckleberry, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as strobili, are clustered at the base of the plant and produce spores. Lycopodiella inundata is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
