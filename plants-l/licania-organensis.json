    "intro": "Licania organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains licania, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Licania organensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
