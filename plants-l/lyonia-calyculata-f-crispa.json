    "intro": "Lyonia calyculata f. crispa, commonly known as the crinkled lyonia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The varietal form 'crispa' is distinguished by its crinkled, wavy leaves, which add a unique texture to its appearance. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and the clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring."
