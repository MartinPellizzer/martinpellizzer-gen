    "intro": "Lumnitzera, commonly known as the mangrove or sea silk, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Combretaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in brackish or saline environments. Lumnitzera species are characterized by their ability to thrive in coastal areas, with specialized adaptations such as aerial roots and salt-excreting leaves. They play a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. The genus includes several species, with Lumnitzera littoralis and Lumnitzera racemosa being the most commonly recognized."
