    "intro": "Lebidiera, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that resemble those of the true hellebore, though they are not closely related. Lebidiera species typically have broad, waxy leaves and produce spadices, which are the characteristic inflorescences of the Araceae family. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value but should be handled with care, as some species are toxic."
