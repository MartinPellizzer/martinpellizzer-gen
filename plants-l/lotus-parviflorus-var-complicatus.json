    "intro": "Lotus parviflorus var. complicatus, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, pale pink to white flowers with intricate, layered petals that resemble the traditional lotus but are smaller in size. The plant grows in shallow freshwater habitats, often in still or slow-moving waters. Its leaves are narrow and floating, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
