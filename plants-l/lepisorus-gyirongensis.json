    "intro": "Lepisorus gyirongensis, commonly known as the Gyirong fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Himalayas, particularly in China and Nepal. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically clustered in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in montane forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. Lepisorus gyirongensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
