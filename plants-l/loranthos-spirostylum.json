    "intro": "Loranthos spirostylum, commonly known as the spiral-leaved mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
