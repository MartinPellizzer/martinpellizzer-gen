    "intro": "Lychnophora souzae, commonly known as the Brazilian peppercorn, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small shrub that typically grows up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, red, peppercorn-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Lychnophora souzae is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
