    "intro": "Leptinella acaenoides, commonly known as the slender mountain everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Leptinella acaenoides is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to cold, windy conditions."
