    "intro": "Leandra xantholasia var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy leandra, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent, stiff hairs along the midrib and margins, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in the spring and summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
