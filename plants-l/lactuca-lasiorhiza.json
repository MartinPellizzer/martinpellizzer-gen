    "intro": "Lactuca lasiorhiza, commonly known as the roughleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly bitter taste. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce varieties."
