    "intro": "Leea guineensis f. comoriensis, commonly known as the Comorian Leea, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or near streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
