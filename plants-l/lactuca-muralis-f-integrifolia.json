    "intro": "Lactuca muralis f. integrifolia, commonly known as the wall lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and leaves that are typically more elongated and less lobed compared to the standard form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by slender, cylindrical seed capsules. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making it a traditional forage plant for livestock. This form is often found growing in rocky or disturbed soils, particularly along walls and in dry, sunny locations."
