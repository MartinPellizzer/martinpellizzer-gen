    "intro": "Lhotskya violacea, commonly known as the violet lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a deep violet to blue-black coloration. The thallus is typically tightly adherent to rock surfaces, especially on shaded, moist substrates in temperate regions. It lacks distinct rhizines and has a homogeneous structure with a thin, waxy cuticle. This lichen is often found in montane and alpine environments, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
