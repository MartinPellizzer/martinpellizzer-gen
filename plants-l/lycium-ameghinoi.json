    "intro": "Lycium ameghinoi, commonly known as the Andean boxthorn, is a shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, red or orange berries that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are small, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
