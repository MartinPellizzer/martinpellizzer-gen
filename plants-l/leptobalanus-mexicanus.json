    "intro": "Leptobalanus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican scale tree, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, woody structure and unique leaf morphology. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
