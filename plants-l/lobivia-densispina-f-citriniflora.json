    "intro": "Lobivia densispina f. citriniflora, commonly known as the Citrine-flowered Lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features pale green to bluish-gray stems covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which contrast beautifully with its foliage. It is well adapted to drought, storing water in its fleshy stems. This variety is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
