    "intro": "Lindernia stolonifera, commonly known as creeping lindernia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground in a mat-like formation. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a dark green color. Lindernia stolonifera thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
