    "intro": "Lendneria ageratifolia, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and its flowering stems that bear small, yellow, four-petaled flowers. The plant produces a capsule fruit containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lendneria ageratifolia is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
