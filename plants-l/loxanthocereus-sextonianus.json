It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among cactus enthusiasts."
