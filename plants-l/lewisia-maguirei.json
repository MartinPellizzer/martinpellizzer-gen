    "intro": "Lewisia maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's lewisia, is a perennial plant native to the United States, specifically found in California and Oregon. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit with fleshy, basal leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
