    "intro": "Liparis penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescence, which produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The orchid's roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees and absorb moisture and nutrients from the air."
