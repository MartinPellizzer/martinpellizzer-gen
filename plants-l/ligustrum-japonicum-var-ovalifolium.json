It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, fleshy berries. It is often used in horticulture for its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
