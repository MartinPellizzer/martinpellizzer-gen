    "intro": "Lepanthes uncinata, commonly known as the hooked slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a basal rosette, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Lepanthes uncinata is often found in tropical rainforests, where it thrives as an epiphyte on trees or rocks."
