    "intro": "Leptospermum rubricaule, commonly known as the red-stemmed tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is distinctive, often appearing reddish or orange when exposed, which contributes to its common name. Leptospermum rubricaule is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments."
