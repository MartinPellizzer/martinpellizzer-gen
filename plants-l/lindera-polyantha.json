    "intro": "Lindera polyantha, commonly known as the fragrant spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves that emit a spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Lindera polyantha is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
