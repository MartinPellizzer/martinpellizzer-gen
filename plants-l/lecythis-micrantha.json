    "intro": "Lecythis micrantha, commonly known as the red guarana, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces a distinctive fruit with a thick, fibrous outer layer. The fruit contains a hard, woody seed that is often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its natural population in the wild."
