    "intro": "Lepisorus cespitosus, commonly known as the clustered mossy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Lepisorus cespitosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in humid habitats."
