    "intro": "Lycopodiella cernua var. capillacea, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and arranged in whorls, giving it a distinct appearance. This variety is distinguished by its finer, more delicate foliage compared to the typical form of Lycopodiella cernua."
