    "intro": "Lophosoria caesia, commonly known as the golden lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Lophosoria caesia is adapted to aquatic environments, with roots that anchor it in muddy or sandy substrates. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
