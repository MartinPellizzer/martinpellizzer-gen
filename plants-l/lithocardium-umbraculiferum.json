    "intro": "Lithocardium umbraculiferum, commonly known as the shadowy rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in rocky, sun-exposed habitats. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, often dark-colored flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, helping it conserve water in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
