    "intro": "Lesquerella cinerea, commonly known as gray lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Lesquerella cinerea is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. It is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
