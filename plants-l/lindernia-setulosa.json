    "intro": "Lindernia setulosa, commonly known as the hairy lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
