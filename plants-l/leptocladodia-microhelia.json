    "intro": "Leptocladodia microhelia, commonly known as the small-leafed liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flat, leaf-like body that is covered in tiny, overlapping scales. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced on the upper surface of the thallus and are used for asexual propagation. Leptocladodia microhelia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
