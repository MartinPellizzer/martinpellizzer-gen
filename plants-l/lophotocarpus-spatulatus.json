    "intro": "Lophotocarpus spatulatus, commonly known as the flat-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Roccellaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is often found on rocks and tree trunks in humid, shaded areas. Its morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for certain forest ecosystems."
