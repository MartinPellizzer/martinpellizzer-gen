    "intro": "Lathyrus ochraceus subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western bitter vetch, is a perennial legume native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various wildlife species."
