    "intro": "Linaria hepaticifolia var. majorica, commonly known as the Mediterranean liverleaf, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, liver-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
