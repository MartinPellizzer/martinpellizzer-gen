    "intro": "Leontodon \u00d7 lannesii, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a single, thick, hollow stem. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
