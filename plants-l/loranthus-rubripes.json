    "intro": "Loranthus rubripes, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds through photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in various regions of Asia and is often associated with trees such as oaks and elms."
