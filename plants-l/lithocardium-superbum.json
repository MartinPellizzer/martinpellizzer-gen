    "intro": "Lithocardium superbum, commonly known as the rockstar orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. The plant belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Lithocardium superbum has a short lifespan, typically blooming only once before dying, which makes it a rare and fascinating species. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat destruction and limited distribution."
