    "intro": "Leontopodium ochroleucum subsp. campestre, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its subspecies campestre is distinguished by its more robust growth and broader leaves compared to other subspecies. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in fragile mountain ecosystems."
