    "intro": "Linaria arenicola, commonly known as the sand linaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Its leaves are narrow and linear, reducing water loss through transpiration. Linaria arenicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
