    "intro": "Lotononis clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, slender stem and a single, pale greenish-white flower. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
