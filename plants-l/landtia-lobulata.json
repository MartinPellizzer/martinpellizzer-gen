    "intro": "Landtia lobulata, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Landtia lobulata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
