    "intro": "Lycopersicon cheesmaniae, commonly known as the Cheesman's tomato, is a species native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of bright red, cherry-sized fruits that are similar in appearance to common tomatoes. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and branched. The flowers are yellow and tubular, typical of the Solanaceae family, and are pollinated by insects."
