    "intro": "Lolium remotum var. aristatum, commonly known as the tall fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often used in lawns and pastures. Its ability to form a dense sod makes it a valuable forage crop and ornamental plant."
