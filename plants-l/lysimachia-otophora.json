    "intro": "Lysimachia otophora, commonly known as the ear-leaf yellowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous stolons that help it spread vegetatively. Lysimachia otophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
