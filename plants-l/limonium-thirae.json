    "intro": "Limonium thirae, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to withstand salty air and coastal winds. Limonium thirae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscaping near the shore."
