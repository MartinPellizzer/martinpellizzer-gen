It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lepidium nanum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and hardy plant in its native habitat."
