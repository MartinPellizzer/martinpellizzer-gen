    "intro": "Lonchocarpus zimmermannii, commonly known as the yellow cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes cultivated for agricultural purposes."
