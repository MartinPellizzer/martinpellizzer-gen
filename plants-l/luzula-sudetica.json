    "intro": "Luzula sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Luzula sudetica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
