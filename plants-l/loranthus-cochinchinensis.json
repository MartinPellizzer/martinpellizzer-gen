    "intro": "Loranthus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, including Southeast Asia and parts of Africa."
