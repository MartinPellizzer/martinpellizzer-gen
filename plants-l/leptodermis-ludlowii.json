    "intro": "Leptodermis ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's leathery lichen, is a rare and distinctive lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus that is typically grayish to brown in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found growing on rocks or tree bark in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
