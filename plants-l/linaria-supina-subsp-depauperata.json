It is a low-growing perennial with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its limited foliage and compact growth make it a distinctive and hardy species in its native environment."
