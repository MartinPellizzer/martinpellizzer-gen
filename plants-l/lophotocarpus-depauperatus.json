    "intro": "Lophotocarpus depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse-fruited lophotocarpus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Its fruits are dry and schizocarpic, splitting into two parts upon maturity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
