    "intro": "Lycium inerme, commonly known as the silverberry, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves and small, red berries that mature in the fall. The plant has a woody stem with thorny branches, and its leaves are typically alternate and oval in shape. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
