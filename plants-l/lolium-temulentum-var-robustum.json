    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. robustum, commonly known as stout ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and coarse, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and somewhat hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and competitive nature."
