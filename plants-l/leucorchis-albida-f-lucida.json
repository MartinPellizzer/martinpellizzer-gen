    "intro": "Leucorchis albida f. lucida, commonly known as the bright white orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale white petals and sepals, which are often adorned with subtle greenish veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant aroma. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
