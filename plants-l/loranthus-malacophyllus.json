    "intro": "Loranthus malacophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its leaf-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating the plant's propagation. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it an ecologically significant but sometimes problematic species."
