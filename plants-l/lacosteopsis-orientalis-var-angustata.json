    "intro": "Lacosteopsis orientalis var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lacosteopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
