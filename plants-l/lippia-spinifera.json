It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, lemony scent, and small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and as a culinary herb due to its pleasant fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for both garden and container growing. Lippia spinifera is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
