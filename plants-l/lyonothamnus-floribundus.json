    "intro": "Lyonothamnus floribundus, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are adapted to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing drought resistance, and it is well-suited to sandy or well-drained soils. Lyonothamnus floribundus plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
