    "intro": "Lepanthes anchorifera, commonly known as the anchor-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Lepanthes anchorifera thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and montane regions."
