    "intro": "Lepidium micropterum, commonly known as the slender cress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features delicate, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, elongated pods containing tiny seeds. Lepidium micropterum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural areas and a subject of study in plant ecology."
