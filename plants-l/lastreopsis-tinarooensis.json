    "intro": "Lastreopsis tinarooensis, commonly known as the Tinaroo rockmoss, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the family Pottiaceae, which includes many small, drought-tolerant mosses. This plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its morphology is characterized by compact, cushion-like growth and dark green to brownish-green foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
