    "intro": "Lessingia, commonly known as the \"snowbell\" or \"bluebell,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and coastal regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue and purple. Lessingia species are often succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves that help them conserve water. The genus includes around 40 species, many of which are native to North America."
