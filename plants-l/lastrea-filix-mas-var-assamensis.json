    "intro": "Lastrea filix-mas var. assamensis, commonly known as the Assam fern, is a rare and unique variant of the common fern species. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the dense undergrowth of tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features include a short, sturdy stem and finely divided leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle. This variant is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a valuable species in botanical research."
