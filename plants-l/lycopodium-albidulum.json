    "intro": "Lycopodium albidulum, commonly known as the white clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium albidulum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
