    "intro": "Lachnopylis platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale to dark green in color and has a leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is often found on rocks, trees, and soil surfaces in temperate and boreal regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
