    "intro": "Lygodium flexuosum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used as a habitat for various small animals and insects. The plant is typically epiphytic, growing on trees and rocks in humid environments. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.
