    "intro": "Laurentia radicans, commonly known as creeping laurel, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a mild, spicy flavor. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
