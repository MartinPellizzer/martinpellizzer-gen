    "intro": "Lachnagrostis rudis, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lachnagrostis rudis is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it a common indicator of wetland ecosystems."
