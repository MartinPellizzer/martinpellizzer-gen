    "intro": "Lycianthes sanctaeclarae, commonly known as the San Clemente nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal sage scrub habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, and they are edible but have a mild, somewhat bitter taste. Lycianthes sanctaeclarae is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its island environment."
