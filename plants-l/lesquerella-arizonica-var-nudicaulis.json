    "intro": "Lesquerella arizonica var. nudicaulis, commonly known as the Arizona lesquerella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces unique, elongated seed pods that contain oily seeds, which are rich in beneficial fatty acids. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
