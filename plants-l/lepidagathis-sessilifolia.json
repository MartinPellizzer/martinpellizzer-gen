    "intro": "Lepidagathis sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. Lepidagathis sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth."
