    "intro": "Linum gypsogenium, commonly known as the gypsum flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Linum gypsogenium is often found in gypsum-rich environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
