    "intro": "Lomandra multiflora subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the coastal lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It features dense, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
