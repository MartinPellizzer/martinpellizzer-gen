    "intro": "Lagocodes belgica, commonly known as the Belgian lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on tree bark, stones, or soil surfaces in temperate regions, particularly in Europe. The thallus, or body, of Lagocodes belgica is crust-like, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface that varies in color from pale green to yellowish-brown. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. This lichen is also used in ecological studies to monitor environmental changes and biodiversity."
