    "intro": "Lugaion angulatum, commonly known as the angular lugaion, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Lugaraceae and is characterized by its distinctive angular leaf shape and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
