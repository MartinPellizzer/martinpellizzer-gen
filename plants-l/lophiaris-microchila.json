It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which are typically borne on a short stalk. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
