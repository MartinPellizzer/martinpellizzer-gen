    "intro": "Lycopodioides stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged spirally along the stems. Lycopodioides stolonifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
