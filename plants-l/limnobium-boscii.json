    "intro": "Limnobium boscii, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Limnobium, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that support a dense covering of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Limnobium boscii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
