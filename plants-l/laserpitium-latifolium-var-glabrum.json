    "intro": "Laserpitium latifolium var. glabrum, commonly known as the broadleaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture in most varieties, though this variant is glabrous, meaning it lacks hair. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
