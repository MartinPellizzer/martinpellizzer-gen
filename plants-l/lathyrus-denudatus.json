    "intro": "Lathyrus denudatus, commonly known as the naked-stem vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Lathyrus denudatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
