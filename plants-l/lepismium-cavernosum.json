    "intro": "Lepismium cavernosum, commonly known as the cave lily, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique growth habit and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens. Lepismium cavernosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its dramatic floral display."
