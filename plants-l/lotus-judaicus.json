It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy pink or red flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in dry soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, spiny pod, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species has cultural significance in Jewish traditions and is sometimes used in religious or ceremonial contexts."
