    "intro": "Leucheria ibarii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth leucheria, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name \"glabrata.\" The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
