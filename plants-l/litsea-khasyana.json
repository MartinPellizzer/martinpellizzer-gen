    "intro": "Litsea khasyana, commonly known as Khasi litsea, is a small evergreen tree native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
