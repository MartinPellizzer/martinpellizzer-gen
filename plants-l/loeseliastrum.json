    "intro": "Loeseliastrum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have hairy, branched stems and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow. Loeseliastrum species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. They play a role in supporting local pollinators and are sometimes used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
