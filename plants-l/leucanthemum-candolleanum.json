    "intro": "Leucanthemum candolleanum, commonly known as the white ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and its showy yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces a single stem that bears the flowers at the top, and it is often found in meadows and grasslands. Leucanthemum candolleanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
