    "intro": "Lachemilla jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
