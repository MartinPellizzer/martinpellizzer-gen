    "intro": "Lindsaea rigescens, commonly known as the rigid lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of stiff, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are often covered in fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Lindsaea rigescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
