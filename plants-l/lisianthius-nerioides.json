It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets surrounding a dark central disk. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often branching. Lisianthius nerioides is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for wildflower gardens."
