    "intro": "Lagenaria vulgaris var. pyriformis, commonly known as the bottle gourd, is a flowering plant native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins, and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, bottle-shaped fruit. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that are either male or female. The fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes hard and fibrous when fully mature. It is valued for its versatility in cooking and its use in traditional medicine."
