    "intro": "Lupinus grauensis, commonly known as the gray lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated seed pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus grauensis is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
