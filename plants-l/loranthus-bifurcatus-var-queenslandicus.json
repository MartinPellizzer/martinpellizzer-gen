    "intro": "Loranthus bifurcatus var. queenslandicus, commonly known as the Queensland mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically orange or red, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees for dispersal. This species is native to eastern Australia and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
