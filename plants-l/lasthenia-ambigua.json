    "intro": "Lasthenia ambigua, commonly known as the sticky yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant's leaves are narrow and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The species is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a common sight in desert and coastal ecosystems."
