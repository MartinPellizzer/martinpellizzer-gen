    "intro": "Leucophae soluta, commonly known as the moonlight lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow under moonlight, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a slender, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers bloom only during the night, typically between late spring and early summer. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Leucophae soluta is considered an endangered species."
