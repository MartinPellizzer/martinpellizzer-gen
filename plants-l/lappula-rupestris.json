    "intro": "Lappula rupestris, commonly known as the rock lappula, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, adapting to poor soil conditions and harsh climates. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in late spring, and it produces smooth, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Lappula rupestris is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
