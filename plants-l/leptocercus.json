    "intro": "Leptocercus, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant is native to parts of Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Leptocercus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
