    "intro": "Lamium staintonii, commonly known as Stainton's dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the British Isles. It features heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of grasslands. Lamium staintonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
