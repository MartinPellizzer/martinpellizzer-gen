It is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly found in countries like Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Lindsaea vitiensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
