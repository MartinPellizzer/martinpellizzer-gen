    "intro": "Lycaste ciliata, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating. Lycaste ciliata thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
