    "intro": "Loranthus collapsus, commonly known as the collapsing mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own food through photosynthesis using the limited foliage it possesses. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often on trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. Its unique ecological role makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
