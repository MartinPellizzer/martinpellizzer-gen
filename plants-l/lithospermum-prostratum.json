    "intro": "Lithospermum prostratum, commonly known as prostrate lithosperm, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. Lithospermum prostratum is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
