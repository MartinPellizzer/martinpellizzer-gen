It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens and a valuable plant for ecological studies."
