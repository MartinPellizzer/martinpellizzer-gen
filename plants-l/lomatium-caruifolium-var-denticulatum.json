    "intro": "Lomatium caruifolium var. denticulatum, commonly known as the denticulate lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, often in regions with cool, moist summers. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, producing a subtle, aromatic scent. This variety is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins, which give it its common name."
