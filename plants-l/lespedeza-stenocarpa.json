    "intro": "Lespedeza stenocarpa, commonly known as narrow-fruited lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces narrow, elongated pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Lespedeza stenocarpa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
