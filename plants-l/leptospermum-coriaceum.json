    "intro": "Leptospermum coriaceum, commonly known as the paperbark tea tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Leptospermum coriaceum is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
