It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its unique appearance and cultural significance, it is often studied for its potential medicinal properties."
