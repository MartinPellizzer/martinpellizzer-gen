    "intro": "Lathyrus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, and it produces elongated pods containing several seeds. Lathyrus rigidus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
