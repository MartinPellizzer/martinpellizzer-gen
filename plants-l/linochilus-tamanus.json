    "intro": "Linochilus tamanus, commonly known as the Tamanus orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip that is often brightly colored. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with a distinct three-lobed lip that serves as a pollinator attractant. Linochilus tamanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical botanical gardens."
