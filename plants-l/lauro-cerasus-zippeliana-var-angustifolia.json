    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus zippeliana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cherry laurel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus laurocerasus and Prunus cerasifera. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that provide dense shade. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark red, edible berries that are favored by birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in gardens and as a hedge plant."
