    "intro": "Luvunga, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of colorful, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Luvunga thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom throughout the year makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
