    "intro": "Lepturus minutus, commonly known as the small leaved lepturus, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
