    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. griseomaculatatus, commonly known as the gray-spotted narrow-leaved lupin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of violet or blue. The leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive grayish or speckled appearance due to the varietal characteristics. This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
