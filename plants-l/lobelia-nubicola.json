    "intro": "Lobelia nubicola, commonly known as the cloud mountain lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a yellow throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Lobelia nubicola plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of mountain ecosystems."
