    "intro": "Lavenia viscida, commonly known as the sticky lavenia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often sticky bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, oval fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
