    "intro": "Lycopodioides lingulata, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodioides lingulata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain woodland ecosystems."
