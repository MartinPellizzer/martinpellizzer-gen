    "intro": "Leucosphaera pfeilii, commonly known as the Pfeil's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, spherical flowers that resemble small, delicate orbs. The plant belongs to the Ericaceae family and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom briefly during the summer months. Due to its restricted habitat and delicate nature, Leucosphaera pfeilii is considered a species of conservation concern."
