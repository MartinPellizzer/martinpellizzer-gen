    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare nanum, commonly known as the dwarf privet, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. Due to its hardiness, it is a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardens."
