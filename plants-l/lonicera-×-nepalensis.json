    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal honeysuckle, is a hybrid shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not recommended for human consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in temperate climates. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable garden plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
