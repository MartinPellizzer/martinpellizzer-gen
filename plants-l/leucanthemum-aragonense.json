    "intro": "Leucanthemum aragonense, commonly known as the Aragon chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features showy white to pale yellow flowers with a central yellow disk, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
