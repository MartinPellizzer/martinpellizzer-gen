    "intro": "Leucophae lotsyi, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a distinctive star-shaped blossom, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Leucophae lotsyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
