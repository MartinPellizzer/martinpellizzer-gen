    "intro": "Lepidagathis reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a distinctive net-like venation pattern. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly cultivated for food. Lepidagathis reticulata is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
