    "intro": "Lotus ifniensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands lotus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and palmately lobed leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the region's unique microclimate. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and it plays a minor role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
