    "intro": "Lotus distichus, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. Lotus distichus plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
