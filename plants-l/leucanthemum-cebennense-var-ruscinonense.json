    "intro": "Leucanthemum cebennense var. ruscinonense, commonly known as the Tuscan dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. It is characterized by its yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets, resembling a dandelion but with a more compact structure. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
