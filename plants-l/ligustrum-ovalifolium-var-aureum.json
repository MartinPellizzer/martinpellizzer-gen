    "intro": "Ligustrum ovalifolium var. aureum, commonly known as golden privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow-green color, especially during the growing season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. Its rapid growth rate and dense foliage make it a popular choice for hedges and screens. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
