It has broad, floating leaves that are typically smooth and dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its stems spread across the water's surface. Limnobium laevigatum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
