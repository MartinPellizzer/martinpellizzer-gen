    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides subsp. appressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
