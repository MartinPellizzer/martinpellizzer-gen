    "intro": "Lonchocarpus fruticosus, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a natural pesticide. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and allelopathic properties make it both a useful and invasive species in certain ecosystems."
