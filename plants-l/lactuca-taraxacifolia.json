    "intro": "Lactuca taraxacifolia, commonly known as the dandelion lettuce, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, dark green leaves and a hollow, ridged stem. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Lactuca taraxacifolia is sometimes cultivated as a leafy vegetable, though its use is less common than other lettuce varieties."
