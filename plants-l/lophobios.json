    "intro": "Lophobios, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, waxy leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Lophobios is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates."
