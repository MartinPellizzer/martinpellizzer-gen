    "intro": "Leptospermum scoparium var. incanum, commonly known as silver m\u0101nuka, is a variant of the m\u0101nuka plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark brown, woody berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a notable species within the Leptospermum genus."
