    "intro": "Linaria multipunctata var. ignescens, commonly known as the flame snapdragon, is a striking annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features vivid orange-red flowers that resemble small flames, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
