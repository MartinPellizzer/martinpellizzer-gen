    "intro": "Lathyrus quinquenervius f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered grass pea, is a variant of the common grass pea native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred petal, and the plant produces small, elongated pods containing one to three seeds. This variety is notable for its reduced pigmentation compared to the typical green-flowered form, making it visually distinct. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful processing."
