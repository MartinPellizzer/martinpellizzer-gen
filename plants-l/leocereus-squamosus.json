    "intro": "Leocereus squamosus, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in white, waxy tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
