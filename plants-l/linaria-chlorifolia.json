    "intro": "Linaria chlorifolia, commonly known as the greenleaf toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This plant thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It is noted for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often found in disturbed or marginal areas."
