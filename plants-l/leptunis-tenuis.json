    "intro": "Leptunis tenuis, commonly known as the slender lepidophyll, is a unique succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thin, thread-like stems that can curl into a compact ball when dry. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season, which are often short-lived. Its leaves are reduced to scales, and it stores water in its stems to survive prolonged droughts. Leptunis tenuis is adapted to extreme heat and low moisture, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
