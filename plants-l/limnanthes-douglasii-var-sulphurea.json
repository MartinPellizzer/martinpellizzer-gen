    "intro": "Limnanthes douglasii var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur yellow marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall, and its ability to thrive in wetland environments. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and wetland biodiversity."
