    "intro": "Laurus nobilis var. flos-pleno, commonly known as the fully flowering laurel, is a cultivar of the bay laurel plant. It is characterized by its dense, showy white flowers that cover the entire plant, making it highly ornamental. The leaves are similar to those of the common laurel, being glossy and aromatic. It is a evergreen shrub or small tree that thrives in warm, humid climates. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for its leaves, which are less aromatic than the standard laurel."
