    "intro": "Lyonia ovalifolia var. foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf lyonia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically broader than they are long, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
