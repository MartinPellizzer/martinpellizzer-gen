    "intro": "Lobelia algoensis, commonly known as the Alaska lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing herb with small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in tundra environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Lobelia algoensis plays a vital role in pollination, attracting insects such as bees and butterflies."
