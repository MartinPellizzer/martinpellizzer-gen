    "intro": "Lachemilla diplophylla, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Lachemilla diplophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often found in alpine tundras and subalpine meadows."
