    "intro": "Lupinus amphibius, commonly known as the water lupin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a hairy texture, and its root system is adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Lupinus amphibius is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in other moist habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting pollinators."
