    "intro": "Leptodactylon pungens subsp. squarrosum, commonly known as the woolly staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often hairy leaf bases that resemble the horns of a stag, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach significant lengths, contributing to its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its more pronounced woolly covering on the leaf bases compared to other varieties of the species."
