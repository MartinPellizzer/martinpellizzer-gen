    "intro": "Lindsaea sagincola, commonly known as the mossy tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with short, fibrous roots and dense, overlapping leaves that form a water-holding cup. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Lindsaea sagincola is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
