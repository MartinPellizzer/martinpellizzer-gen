    "intro": "Laburnum anagyroides subsp. alschingeri, commonly known as the yellow chain tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pendulous flowers that appear in early spring, forming long, drooping clusters. The plant has slender, woody stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often used in landscape design and as a hedging plant."
