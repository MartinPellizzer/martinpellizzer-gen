    "intro": "Lysimachia fistulosa var. fistulosa, commonly known as the yellow loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
