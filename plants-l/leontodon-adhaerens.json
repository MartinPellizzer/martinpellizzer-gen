    "intro": "Leontodon adhaerens, commonly known as the sticky leontodon, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, which help in deterring herbivores. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
