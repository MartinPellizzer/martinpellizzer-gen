    "intro": "Lupinus sileri, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant features upright stems with clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, linear leaflets. Lupinus sileri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
