    "intro": "Lycianthes jelskii, commonly known as the Jelskii's Physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and often clustered in the axils of the leaves. The fruit, which is a type of berry, is enclosed in a papery husk and is edible when ripe, though it is not as commonly cultivated as other physalis species."
