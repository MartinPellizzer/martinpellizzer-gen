    "intro": "Lupinus umbellatus, commonly known as the clustered lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Lupinus umbellatus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites."
