    "intro": "Limnanthes floccosa subsp. bellingeriana, commonly known as the Bellinger's marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent, inflated petals that resemble small balloons. It thrives in wet, muddy habitats such as marshes and pond edges, often forming dense colonies. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with a short growing season in spring."
