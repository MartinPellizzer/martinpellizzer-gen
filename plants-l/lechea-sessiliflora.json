    "intro": "Lechea sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among the milkweed genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Lechea sessiliflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
