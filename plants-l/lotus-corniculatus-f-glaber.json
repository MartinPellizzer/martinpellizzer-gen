    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus f. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous horned vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, narrow pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature. This variety is distinguished by its reduced hairiness compared to other forms of Lotus corniculatus."
