It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune environments or along shorelines. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are usually green to purple in color. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
