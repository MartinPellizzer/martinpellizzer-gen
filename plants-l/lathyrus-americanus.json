    "intro": "Lathyrus americanus, commonly known as the American vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Lathyrus americanus is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open fields."
