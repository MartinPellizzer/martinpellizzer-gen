    "intro": "Lindernia nelliyampathiensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Linderniaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is a perennial herb that produces seeds through self-fertilization, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
