    "intro": "Laurus variifolia, commonly known as the Turkish laurel or sweet laurel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a evergreen shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though they are milder than those of the bay laurel. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly used in gardens and landscapes."
