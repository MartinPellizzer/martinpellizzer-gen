    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides var. aquaticum, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its clustered, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. This variety is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
