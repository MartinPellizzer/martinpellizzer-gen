    "intro": "Lupinus mucronulatus var. umatillensis, commonly known as the Umatilla lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open areas such as meadows and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
