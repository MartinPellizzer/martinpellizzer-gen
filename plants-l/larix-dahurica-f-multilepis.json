    "intro": "Larix dahurica f. multilepis, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a variant of the Dahurian larch native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are arranged in a distinctive two-ranked pattern, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, subarctic environments. Its resilience to cold temperatures makes it an important species in boreal and subarctic ecosystems."
