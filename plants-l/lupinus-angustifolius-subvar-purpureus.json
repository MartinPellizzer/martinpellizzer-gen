    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius subvar. purpureus, commonly known as the purple narrow-leafed lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces tall spikes of showy purple or violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
