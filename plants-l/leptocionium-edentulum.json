It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with four petals and a distinctive spur. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
