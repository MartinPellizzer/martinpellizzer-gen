    "intro": "Leiphaimos brachyloba f. cyanescens, commonly known as the blue-leaved leiphaimos, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its striking blue foliage. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic compounds and often biennial or perennial growth habit. The plant features a compact, bushy structure with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that turn a vivid blue when mature. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
