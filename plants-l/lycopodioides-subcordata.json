    "intro": "Lycopodioides subcordata, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like clusters on the ground. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
