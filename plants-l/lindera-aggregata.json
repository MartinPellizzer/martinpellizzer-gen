    "intro": "Lindera aggregata, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal panicles. These flowers give way to bright red, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. Lindera aggregata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
