    "intro": "Lamium crinitum, commonly known as the curly-stemmed deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium crinitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support pollinators."
