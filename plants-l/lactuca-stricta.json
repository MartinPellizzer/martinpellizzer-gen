    "intro": "Lactuca stricta, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stem and serrated, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that develop into fluffy, white, seed-producing structures. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its latex-containing sap can cause skin irritation, making it a plant with both ecological and potential medicinal significance."
