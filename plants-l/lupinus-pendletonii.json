    "intro": "Lupinus pendletonii, commonly known as Pendleton's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pendleton's lupine is considered a rare and endangered species."
