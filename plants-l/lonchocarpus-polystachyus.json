It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant produces large, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in ecological systems."
