    "intro": "Lespedeza tomentosa var. globiracemosa, commonly known as the woolly lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a bushy growth habit with hairy, grayish-green foliage that gives it its \"tomentosa\" designation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, making it a common sight in disturbed soils. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives best in well-drained, loamy conditions."
