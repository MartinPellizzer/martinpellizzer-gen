It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Lycopodium arcturi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small organisms in its harsh environment."
