    "intro": "Limosella tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Limosella tenella is adapted to salty and windy environments, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing dune soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
