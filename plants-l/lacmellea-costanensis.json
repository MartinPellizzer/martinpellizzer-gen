    "intro": "Lacmellea costanensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican millepore, is a rare and unique plant species native to the humid forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with intricate leaf structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or rock surfaces. Its small, spirally arranged leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in efficient water retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lacmellea costanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
