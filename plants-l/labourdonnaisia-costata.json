    "intro": "Labourdonnaisia costata, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and it has a robust root system that helps it withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Labourdonnaisia costata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
