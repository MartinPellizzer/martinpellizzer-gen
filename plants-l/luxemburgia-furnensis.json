    "intro": "Luxemburgia furnensis, commonly known as the Furness luxemburgia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Luxembourg. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Luxemburgia furnensis is typically found in shaded forest understories, where it forms dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
