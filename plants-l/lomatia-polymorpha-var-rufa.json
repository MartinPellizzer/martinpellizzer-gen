    "intro": "Lomatia polymorpha var. rufa, commonly known as the red lomatia, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
