    "intro": "Lysipomia laciniata subsp. meridensis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. This subspecies is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
