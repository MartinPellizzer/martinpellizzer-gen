    "intro": "Lechea pulchella var. ramosissima, commonly known as the ramose milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The ramose milkweed is an important host plant for several species of native butterflies and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
