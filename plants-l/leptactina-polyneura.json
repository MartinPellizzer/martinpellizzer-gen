    "intro": "Leptactina polyneura, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species."
