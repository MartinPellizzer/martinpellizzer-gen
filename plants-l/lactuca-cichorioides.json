It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive bitter taste. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, spiky fruits. Lactuca cichorioides is often considered a weed but can be used in some traditional herbal remedies."
