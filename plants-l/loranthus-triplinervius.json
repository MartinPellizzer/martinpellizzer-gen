    "intro": "Loranthus triplinervius, commonly known as the three-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Myrtaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
