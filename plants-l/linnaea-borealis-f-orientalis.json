    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental twinflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished from the typical Linnaea borealis by its slightly different floral structure and geographic distribution."
