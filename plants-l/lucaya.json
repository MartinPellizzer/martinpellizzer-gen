    "intro": "Lucaya, commonly known as the \"white mangosteen,\" is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is closely related to the common mangosteen, but it differs in its smaller size and distinct appearance. The plant produces small, round fruits with a white, firm flesh that is typically consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and emit a fragrant aroma, contributing to its ornamental value. Lucaya is also valued for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses attributed to its leaves and fruit."
