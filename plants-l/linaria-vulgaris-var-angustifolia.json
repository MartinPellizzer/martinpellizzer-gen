It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged oppositely along the stem. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.
