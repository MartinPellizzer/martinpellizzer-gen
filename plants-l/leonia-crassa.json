    "intro": "Leonia crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its thick, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to surfaces such as tree bark or rock. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Leonia crassa is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
