    "intro": "Lastrea lomatosora, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent, spoon-like petals that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
