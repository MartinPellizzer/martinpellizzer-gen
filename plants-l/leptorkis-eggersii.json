    "intro": "Leptorkis eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' lichen, is a rare and specialized member of the Lecanoromycetes class. It is a saxicolous lichen, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is crustose, forming a tightly adherent, flat layer on the substrate. It is characterized by its unique chemical composition, including the presence of specific depsides and depsidones. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
