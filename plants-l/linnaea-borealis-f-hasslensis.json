    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. hasslensis, commonly known as the Hasslens' twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in boreal forests and rocky soils. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, adding a delicate beauty to the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
