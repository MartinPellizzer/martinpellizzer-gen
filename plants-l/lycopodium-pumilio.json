    "intro": "Lycopodium pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, branching structure with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium pumilio typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
