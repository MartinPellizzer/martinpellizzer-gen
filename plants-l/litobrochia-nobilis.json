    "intro": "Litobrochia nobilis, commonly known as the noble rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and produces small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a touch of beauty to its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Litobrochia nobilis is considered a species of conservation concern."
