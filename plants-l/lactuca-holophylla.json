The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its scientific name reflects its unique leaf structure, with \"holophylla\" referring to the full coverage of hairs on the leaves. Lactuca holophylla is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
