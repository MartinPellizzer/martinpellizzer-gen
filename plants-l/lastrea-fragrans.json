    "intro": "Lastrea fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its fragrant, showy blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and pleasant aroma."
