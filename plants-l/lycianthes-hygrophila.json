    "intro": "Lycianthes hygrophila, commonly known as the waterleaf or swamp nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Its roots are often fibrous and can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Lycianthes hygrophila is known for its ability to thrive in saturated soils, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
