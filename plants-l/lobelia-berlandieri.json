    "intro": "Lobelia berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. Lobelia berlandieri is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
