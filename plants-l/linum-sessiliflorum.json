    "intro": "Linum sessiliflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oval seeds. Its leaves are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Linum sessiliflorum is often found in grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas, and it has been used historically for its fibrous stalks."
