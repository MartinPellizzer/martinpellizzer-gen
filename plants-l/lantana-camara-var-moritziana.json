It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, depending on the stage of bloom. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and root fragments."
