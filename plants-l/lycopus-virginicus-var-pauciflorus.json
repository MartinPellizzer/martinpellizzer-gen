    "intro": "Lycopus virginicus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as narrow-leaved bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly aromatic scent. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in whorls along the stems. It is characterized by its reduced flower count, which gives it the species name \"pauciflorus,\" meaning \"few-flowered.\""
