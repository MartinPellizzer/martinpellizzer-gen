It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it survive in arid environments. The plants typically grow in sandy or rocky soils, often in desert regions. Lehmannia species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually green or red in color. These plants are adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low water availability."
