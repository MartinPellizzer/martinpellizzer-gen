The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Lasiopera tenuifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
