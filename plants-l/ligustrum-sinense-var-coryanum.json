It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It is often used as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
