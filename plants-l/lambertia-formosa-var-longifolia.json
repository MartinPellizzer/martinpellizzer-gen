    "intro": "Lambertia formosa var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved lambertia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and showy, orange-red flowers that appear in winter. The plant features long, narrow leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. The species is also valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract birds and insects."
