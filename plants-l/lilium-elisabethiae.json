The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with broad, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
