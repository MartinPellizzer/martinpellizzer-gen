It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, hyacinth-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense basal rosette. Lachenalia hyacinthina is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
