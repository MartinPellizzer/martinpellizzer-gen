    "intro": "Listera meifongensis, commonly known as the Meifong spring beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in a raceme. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Listera meifongensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
