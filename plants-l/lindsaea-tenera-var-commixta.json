    "intro": "Lindsaea tenera var. commixta, commonly known as the hairy lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are usually clustered at the tips of its branches. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
