    "intro": "Lophiolepis czerkessica, commonly known as the Caucasian lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to its substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of green algae, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or tree bark. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
