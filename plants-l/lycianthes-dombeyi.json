    "intro": "Lycianthes dombeyi, commonly known as the Dombey's Physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright orange, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of growth. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the plant typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial."
