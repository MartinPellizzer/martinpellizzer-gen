    "intro": "Lecanorchis kiusiana var. suginoana, commonly known as the Sugino's ghost orchid, is a rare and highly specialized orchid species native to Japan. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on the bark of trees in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces delicate, pale pink or white flowers with a unique, ghostly appearance, which contributes to its common name. It has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, relying on them for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
