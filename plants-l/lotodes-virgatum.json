    "intro": "Lotodes virgatum, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, opening in the morning and closing in the afternoon. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Lotodes virgatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
