    "intro": "Lindsaea tetraptera, commonly known as the four-wing lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are often arranged in a rosette-like pattern. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are usually brightly colored. Lindsaea tetraptera plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling in the canopy."
