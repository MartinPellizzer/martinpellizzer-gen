It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
