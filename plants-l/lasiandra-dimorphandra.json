    "intro": "Lasiandra dimorphandra, commonly known as the red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves that are alternate and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands. Lasiandra dimorphandra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in the timber industry."
