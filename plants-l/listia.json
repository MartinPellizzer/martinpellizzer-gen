    "intro": "Listia, commonly known as the \"lady's mantle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating, which helps to retain moisture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often in shades of pink, red, or white. Listia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often grown in gardens for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional herbal medicine."
