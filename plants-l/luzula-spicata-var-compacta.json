    "intro": "Luzula spicata var. compacta, commonly known as compact tufted woodrush, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, whitish to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often forming dense mats. Its compact form makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded landscapes."
