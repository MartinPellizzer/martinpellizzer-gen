    "intro": "Loranthus rotundifolius, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically the oak. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It plays a role in ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals, and its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries. Despite its parasitic nature, it is not considered harmful to its host in most cases."
