    "intro": "Ledebouria corrugata, commonly known as the zigzag bulb, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming leaves that are often marked with distinctive wavy patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It is a succulent, storing water in its fleshy, bulbous stem, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Ledebouria corrugata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
