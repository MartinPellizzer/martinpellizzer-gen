    "intro": "Lupinus bracteolaris f. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse lupin, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of delicate, blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Its foliage is often sparse, giving it the common name \"sparse lupin.\" This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy environments."
