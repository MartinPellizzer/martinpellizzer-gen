    "intro": "Libocedrus austrocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian lacebark, is a species of conifer native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely fissured bark that gives it a lace-like appearance. The plant is a medium-sized tree with a conical shape and dense foliage of needle-like leaves. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in montane forests."
