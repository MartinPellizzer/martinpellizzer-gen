It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.
