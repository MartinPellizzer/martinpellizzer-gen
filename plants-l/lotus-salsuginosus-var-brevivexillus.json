    "intro": "Lotus salsuginosus var. brevivexillus, commonly known as the dwarf saltbush lotus, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of pink or pale purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to saline and drought-prone environments, making it a hardy species for harsh conditions. Its root system helps stabilize soil, and it is often used in revegetation projects. The variety brevivexillus is distinguished by its shorter stems and compact growth habit compared to other varieties of Lotus salsuginosus."
