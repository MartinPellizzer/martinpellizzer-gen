It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure that resembles moss. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
