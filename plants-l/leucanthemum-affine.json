    "intro": "Leucanthemum affine, commonly known as the common oxeye daisy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white petals with a yellow center, forming showy flower heads that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed habitats. Leucanthemum affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
