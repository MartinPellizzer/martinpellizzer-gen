The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands. The showy inflorescence attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
