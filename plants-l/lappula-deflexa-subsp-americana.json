It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, and the fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This species is of interest to botanists due to its adaptability and ecological role in sandy and arid environments."
