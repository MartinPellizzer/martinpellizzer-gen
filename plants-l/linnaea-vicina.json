It is characterized by its delicate, paired flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pink. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly hairy texture. Its roots are fibrous and help it thrive in moist, acidic soils.
