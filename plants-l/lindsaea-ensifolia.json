    "intro": "Lindsaea ensifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that resemble swords. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clusters, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Lindsaea ensifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
