It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, spiky flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and prairies, and it thrives in full sun. Its tall, upright stems can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a striking feature in native plant gardens. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically pink to purple in color and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
