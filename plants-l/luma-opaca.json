    "intro": "Luma opaca, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a species native to the humid lowland forests of eastern Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 15 meters tall. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of wax, giving it its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, orange-red berries. Luma opaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal fruit."
