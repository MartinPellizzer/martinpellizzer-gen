It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats or clusters over time. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a unique, feathery texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Lemeltonia requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish, making it a rewarding plant for those who can provide the right conditions."
