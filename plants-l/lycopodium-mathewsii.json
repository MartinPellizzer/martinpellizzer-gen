It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems, which are typically green to reddish in color. Lycopodium mathewsii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
