    "intro": "Litobrochia vespertilionis, commonly known as the bat's foot orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by bats. The plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments, where it has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its blooming period coincides with the activity of its primary pollinators, the fruit bat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
