It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often swollen and ribbed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
