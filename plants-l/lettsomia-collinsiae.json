    "intro": "Lettsomia collinsiae, commonly known as the Collinsia lettuce, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and it blooms during the cooler months of the year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lettsomia collinsiae is considered a rare and endangered species."
