    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus colchica, commonly known as the Caucasian cherry or Prunus colchica, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
