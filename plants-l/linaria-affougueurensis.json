    "intro": "Linaria affougueurensis, commonly known as the Affougueurensis toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert in northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Linaria affougueurensis is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
