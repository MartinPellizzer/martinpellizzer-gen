    "intro": "Lolium remotum f. asperum, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is typically dark green and has a somewhat bitter taste, making it less palatable to livestock. Lolium remotum f. asperum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
