    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved clubmoss, is a variant of the common clubmoss species. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, moss-like foliage. The plant features whorled leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical variety, contributing to its distinct appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Botanically, it belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is notable for its spore-producing structures called strobila."
