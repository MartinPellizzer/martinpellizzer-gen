    "intro": "Laseguea antennacea, commonly known as the horned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus with a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Laseguea antennacea is notable for its unique morphology, which includes small, horn-like projections on its surface."
