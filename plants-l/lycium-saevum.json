    "intro": "Lycium saevum, commonly known as the rough boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered unpalatable to humans. Lycium saevum thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrublands. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
