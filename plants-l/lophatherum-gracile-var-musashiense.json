It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
