    "intro": "Lathyrus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable pea or variable vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from simple to compound, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically arranged in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Lathyrus heterophyllus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
