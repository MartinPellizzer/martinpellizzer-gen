    "intro": "Luzula nivea var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to white flowers that appear in early spring. Luzula nivea var. minuta is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
