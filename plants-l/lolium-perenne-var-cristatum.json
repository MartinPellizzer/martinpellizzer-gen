    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. cristatum, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a variant of perennial ryegrass characterized by its distinctive tufted or rosette-like growth habit. It is a cool-season grass that typically forms dense, low-growing mats with fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, sports fields, and wetland areas. Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is also cultivated for landscaping purposes."
