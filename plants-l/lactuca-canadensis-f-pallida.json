    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis f. pallida, commonly known as the pale lettuce, is a subspecies of the common lettuce native to North America. It is characterized by its pale green to nearly white foliage, which distinguishes it from the more typical dark green leaves of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, and its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
