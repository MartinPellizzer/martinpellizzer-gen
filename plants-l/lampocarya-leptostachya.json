It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
