    "intro": "Lespedeza sericophylla, commonly known as silky lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fluffy, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Silky lespedeza is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its delicate appearance makes it a desirable ornamental plant in native plant gardens."
