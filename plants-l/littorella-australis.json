    "intro": "Littorella australis, commonly known as the Australian sea lettuce, is a marine plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a type of green algae that thrives in intertidal zones, often found in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has a ribbon-like structure composed of thin, translucent blades that float or lie close to the water's surface. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Littorella australis is adapted to withstand fluctuating salinity and tidal conditions, making it a resilient species in dynamic coastal environments."
