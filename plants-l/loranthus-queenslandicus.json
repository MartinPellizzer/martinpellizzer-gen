    "intro": "Loranthus queenslandicus, commonly known as the Queensland mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to northeastern Australia. It attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily eucalyptus and acacia, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis. Its small, white or greenish flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that contain sticky seeds. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
