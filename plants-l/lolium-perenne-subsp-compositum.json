    "intro": "Lolium perenne subsp. compositum, commonly known as Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Timothy grass is valued for forage and has also been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
