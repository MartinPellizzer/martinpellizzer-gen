    "intro": "Limonium obtusifolium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and gray-green, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty, coastal habitat. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and rocky shores. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium obtusifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
