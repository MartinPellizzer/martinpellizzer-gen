    "intro": "Lupinus albicaulis var. elatus, commonly known as the silverleaf lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and silvery-white foliage that contrasts with its blue to purple flower clusters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of nodules formed in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. This variety is often found in open, disturbed sites such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
