It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail along supports. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for birds. Lonicera nomurana is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions."
