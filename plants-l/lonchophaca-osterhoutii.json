It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
