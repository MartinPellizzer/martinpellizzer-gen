    "intro": "Lanium hioramii, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Lanium hioramii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
