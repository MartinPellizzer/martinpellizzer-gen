    "intro": "Lachnanthes tinctorum, commonly known as the prairie smoke or purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of feathery, pinkish-purple bracts resembling smoke at the top of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are surrounded by these distinctive bracts, which are modified leaves. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is often found in the central and eastern United States. Lachnanthes tinctorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
