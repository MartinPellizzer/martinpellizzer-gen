    "intro": "Lithocarpus sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers and develops inedible, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and plays a crucial role in the ecological structure of its habitat. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
