    "intro": "Lepanthes volsella, commonly known as the Volcanic Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes volsella is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests."
