    "intro": "Lilium carneum, commonly known as the pink lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to white petals and a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive harsh winters. Lilium carneum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
