    "intro": "Lepidolopha talassica, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and humid environments, often growing near the shoreline. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it a hardy species adapted to coastal ecosystems. Lepidolopha talassica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
