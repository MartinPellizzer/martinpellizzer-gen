    "intro": "Limodorum trabutianum, commonly known as the Trabut's lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, violet-colored blooms with a distinct, intricate structure. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
