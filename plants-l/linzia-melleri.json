    "intro": "Linzia melleri, commonly known as the Meller's linza, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streambanks. Linzia melleri is often found in the North and South Islands of New Zealand, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
