    "intro": "Lysimachia roseola, commonly known as the pink willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Lysimachia roseola thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
