It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind.
