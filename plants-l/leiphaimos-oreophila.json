    "intro": "Leiphaimos oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
