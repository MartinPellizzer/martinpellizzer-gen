    "intro": "Leptocereus velozianus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers are short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Its growth habit and flowering pattern make it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
