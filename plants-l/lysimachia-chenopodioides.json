    "intro": "Lysimachia chenopodioides, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
