    "intro": "Leymus chakassicus, commonly known as Chakassian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. This grass plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native range."
