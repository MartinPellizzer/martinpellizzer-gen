    "intro": "Lathyrus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high altitudes. Lathyrus subalpinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
