It is characterized by its ovate, broad leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland environments. This form is notable for its distinct leaf shape and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
