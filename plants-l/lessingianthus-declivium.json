    "intro": "Lessingianthus declivium, commonly known as the mountain sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive ray floret structure, resembling a sunflower. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Lessingianthus declivium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
