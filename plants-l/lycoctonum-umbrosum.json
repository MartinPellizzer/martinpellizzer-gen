    "intro": "Lycoctonum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces elegant, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and delicate nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
