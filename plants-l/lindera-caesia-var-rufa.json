    "intro": "Lindera caesia var. rufa, commonly known as the red-leaf ligustrum, is a variant of the fragrant sumac native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching branches and small, opposite leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its leaves are often hairy on the underside, and the plant has a moderate growth rate, making it suitable for hedges or ornamental planting. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun."
