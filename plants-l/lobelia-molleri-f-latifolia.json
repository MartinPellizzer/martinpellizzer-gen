It features small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical form of Lobelia molleri. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
