    "intro": "Loasa tricolor var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate three-color loasa, is a low-growing shrub native to the Andes of South America. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
