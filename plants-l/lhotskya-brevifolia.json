    "intro": "Lhotskya brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its compact, crustose growth form and is typically found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale to dark gray, and it may develop a powdery coating of soredia, which aids in reproduction. It is widely distributed across regions with suitable substrates, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
