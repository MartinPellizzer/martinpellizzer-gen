    "intro": "Leptadenia heterophylla, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves that vary in shape, hence its species name *heterophylla*. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. The plant is also noted for its latex sap, which has been used in traditional medicine."
