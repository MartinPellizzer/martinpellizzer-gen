    "intro": "Lupinus regius, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lupine, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a feathery appearance, and its root system is adapted to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils. Lupinus regius plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
