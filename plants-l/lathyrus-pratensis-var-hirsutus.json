    "intro": "Lathyrus pratensis var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Lathyrus pratensis var. hirsutus is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
