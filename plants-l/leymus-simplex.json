    "intro": "Leymus simplex, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Leymus simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in erosion control due to its dense root system. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer."
