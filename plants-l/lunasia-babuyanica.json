    "intro": "Lunasia babuyanica, commonly known as the Philippine moon vine, is a climbing plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant produces small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fibrous pulp. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation outside its native range."
