    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum subsp. clavatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in acidic soils and its historical use in traditional medicine."
