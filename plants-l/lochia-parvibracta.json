    "intro": "Lochia parvibracta, commonly known as the small-bracted orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a faint fragrance, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems."
