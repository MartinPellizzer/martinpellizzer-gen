    "intro": "Lobelia tortuosa var. haupuensis, commonly known as the H\u0101pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014d \u02bb\u0113k\u0101, is a rare Hawaiian plant characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is native to the island of Hawai\u02bbi. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its flowers are small, tubular, and often blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
