    "intro": "Lespedeza \u00d7 nuttallii, commonly known as the silverleaf lespedeza, is a hybrid perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, fluffy pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It has trifoliate leaves and produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds. Lespedeza \u00d7 nuttallii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
