    "intro": "Lateristachys lateralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the winter months. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
