    "intro": "Lonchocarpus nicou var. typicus, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mangle*, is a tropical tree species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which provide structural support and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing several seeds. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine ecosystems. Its adaptability to saline environments makes it an important component of mangrove forests."
