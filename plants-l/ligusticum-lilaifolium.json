    "intro": "Ligusticum lilaifolium, commonly known as the fragrant lovage, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, often parsley-like foliage. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like lobes and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum lilaifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland areas."
