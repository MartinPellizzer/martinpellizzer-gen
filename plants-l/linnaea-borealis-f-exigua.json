    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, urn-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and persist throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. The species is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded garden settings."
