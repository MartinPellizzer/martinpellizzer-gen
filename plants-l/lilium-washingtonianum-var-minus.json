    "intro": "Lilium washingtonianum var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf Washington lily, is a rare and delicate species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a slight greenish tinge. The plant typically grows to a height of only 10\u201320 centimeters, making it one of the smallest members of the lily family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
