    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subvar. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of bird's-foot trefoil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
