    "intro": "Leontodon montanus, commonly known as the mountain leontodon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. It has small, linear leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions."
