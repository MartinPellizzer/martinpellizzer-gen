    "intro": "Luzula multiflora, commonly known as the common woodrush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale blue flowers in the spring. Luzula multiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization in wetland areas."
