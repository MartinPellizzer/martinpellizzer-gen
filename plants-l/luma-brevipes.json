    "intro": "Luma brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf luma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically elliptical and covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Luma brevipes thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
