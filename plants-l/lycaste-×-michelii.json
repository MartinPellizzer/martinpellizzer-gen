It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a robust pseudobulb with long, strap-like leaves that are dark green in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lycaste \u00d7 michelii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
