    "intro": "Lantana salviifolia var. ternata, commonly known as the silverleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in some environments."
