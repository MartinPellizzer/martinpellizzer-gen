    "intro": "Luzula forsteri var. macrospica, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses and sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, ribbed stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed spikelets that are clustered at the top of the stems. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
