    "intro": "Lamium gesneroides, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves with a distinctive purple underside, and its flowers are tubular with two lips, typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds. Lamium gesneroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
