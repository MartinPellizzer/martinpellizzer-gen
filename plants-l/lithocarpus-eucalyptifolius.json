    "intro": "Lithocarpus eucalyptifolius, commonly known as the eucalyptus-leaf stone\u680e, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Its fruit is a one-seeded nut enclosed in a thick, woody shell, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. This species is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
