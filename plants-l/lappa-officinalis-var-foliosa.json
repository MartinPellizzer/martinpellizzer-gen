    "intro": "Lappa officinalis var. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved hogweed, is a biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface and a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, riverbanks, and waste areas. Due to its toxic sap and phototoxic properties, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant to handle."
