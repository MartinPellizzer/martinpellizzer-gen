    "intro": "Ligustrum sinense var. opienense, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. The species is also used in horticulture for hedging and as a landscape plant due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
