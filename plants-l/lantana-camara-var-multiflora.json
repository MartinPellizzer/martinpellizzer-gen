    "intro": "Lantana camara var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the Americas. It features opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange to red, depending on the stage of blooming. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various climates. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
