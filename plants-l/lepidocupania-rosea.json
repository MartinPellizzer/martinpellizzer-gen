    "intro": "Lepidocupania rosea, commonly known as the pink-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that turn a striking pinkish hue under direct sunlight. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its unique coloration makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, Lepidocupania rosea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
