    "intro": "Lyonia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lyonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial shade, often found in woodland areas. Its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers make it an attractive addition to native gardens. Lyonia longipes is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
