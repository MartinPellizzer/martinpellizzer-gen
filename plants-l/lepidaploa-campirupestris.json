    "intro": "Lepidaploa campirupestris, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered blooms in shades of white, pink, or purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepidaploa campirupestris is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
