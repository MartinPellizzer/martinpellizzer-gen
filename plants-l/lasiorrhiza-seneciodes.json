It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is noted for its drought tolerance and adaptability to arid environments."
