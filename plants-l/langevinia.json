    "intro": "Langevinia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Langevinia species typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with hairy leaves and sturdy stems that allow them to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, such as Langevinia multiflora and Langevinia virgata, which are popular in horticulture."
