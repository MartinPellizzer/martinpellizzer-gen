    "intro": "Leichhardtia viridiflora subsp. tropica, commonly known as the tropical green-flowered leichhardtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as sandplains and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
