    "intro": "Lycaste \u00d7 balliae, commonly known as the Ballia lycaste, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Lycaste meleagris and Lycaste berteroana. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant features large, showy flowers with intricate patterns of purple, yellow, and green, often resembling those of its parent species. It typically grows as an epiphytic orchid, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens for its beauty and unique floral characteristics."
