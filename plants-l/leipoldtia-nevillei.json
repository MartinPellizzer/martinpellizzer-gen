    "intro": "Leipoldtia nevillei, commonly known as the Neville's leipoldtia, is a rare and small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants found in the fynbos biome. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
