It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive four-leaf clover-like pattern on its petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
