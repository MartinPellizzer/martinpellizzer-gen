    "intro": "Linum hispanicum f. imperforatum, commonly known as the imperforate flax, is a rare botanical variant of the flax species. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that lack the typical perforations found in other flax varieties. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, with five petals arranged symmetrically. Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
