    "intro": "Lathyrus frolovii, commonly known as the Frolov's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lathyrus frolovii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
