    "intro": "Ligusticum pseudomodestum, commonly known as the western ligusticum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small yellow flowers appear in late spring and are followed by small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
