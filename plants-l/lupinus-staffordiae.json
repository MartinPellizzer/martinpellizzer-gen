    "intro": "Lupinus staffordiae, commonly known as Stafford's lupin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring upright stems and dense clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Lupinus staffordiae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for native pollinators."
