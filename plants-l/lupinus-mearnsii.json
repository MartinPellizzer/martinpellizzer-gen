It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and open grasslands.
