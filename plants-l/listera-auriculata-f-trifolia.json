    "intro": "Listera auriculata f. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leafed basket lily, is a rare and striking woodland plant characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. The plant features three heart-shaped leaflets that are often adorned with a silvery or white border, giving it a unique appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a bell-shaped inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
