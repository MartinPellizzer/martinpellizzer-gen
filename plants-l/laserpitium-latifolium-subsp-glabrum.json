    "intro": "Laserpitium latifolium subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the broadleaf lasur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, coastal habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ecological importance and unique appearance, it is a valued plant in native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
