    "intro": "Labordia molokaiana var. lophocarpa, commonly known as the Moloka\u02bbi sandalwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka\u02bbi. It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and aromatic leaves, which are often used in traditional Hawaiian practices. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy fruits. It thrives in coastal and dry forest habitats, adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native range. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
