    "intro": "Listera unguiculata, commonly known as the white crowfoot, is a delicate herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Listera unguiculata is also known for its short, hairy stems and its role as a nectar source for early pollinators. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to woodland gardens and a valuable component of native plant ecosystems."
