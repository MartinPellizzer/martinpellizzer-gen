    "intro": "Lastrea aurita, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Lastrea aurita is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal watering to thrive."
