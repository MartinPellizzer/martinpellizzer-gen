    "intro": "Leea serrulata, commonly known as the serrated leaf vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in traditional medicine."
