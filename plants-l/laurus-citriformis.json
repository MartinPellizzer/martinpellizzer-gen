    "intro": "Laurus citriformis, commonly known as the citronella laurel, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange, fleshy fruits that contain aromatic seeds. Its foliage is valued for its citrus-like scent, which is used in perfumes and insect repellents. Laurus citriformis thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
