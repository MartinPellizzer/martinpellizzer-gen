    "intro": "Liatris spicata var. resinosa, commonly known as the resinous blazing star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear dense, spike-like clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy and gray-green in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. The resinous scent of its leaves is a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other members of the Liatria genus."
