    "intro": "Leonurus glabra, commonly known as lesser hedgehog\u5c3f, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported sedative and antispasmodic properties. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
