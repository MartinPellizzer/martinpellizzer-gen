    "intro": "Lophiolepis adunca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen orchid, is a rare and specialized epiphytic plant found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lophiolepis adunca is considered a vulnerable species."
