    "intro": "Londesia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized aerial roots. Londesia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
