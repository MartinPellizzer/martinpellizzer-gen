    "intro": "Loranthus whitei, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and other broad-leaved trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, often appearing in clusters. Loranthus whitei plays a role in ecological interactions, contributing to the nutrient cycle and providing habitat for various organisms."
