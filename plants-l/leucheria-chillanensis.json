    "intro": "Leucheria chillanensis, commonly known as the Chilean leucheria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a disk-like structure. Leucheria chillanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh, high-altitude climates."
