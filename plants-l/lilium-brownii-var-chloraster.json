    "intro": "Lilium brownii var. chloraster, commonly known as the yellow lily, is a rare and striking perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold climates, and the species is noted for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
