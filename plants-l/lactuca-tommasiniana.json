    "intro": "Lactuca tommasiniana, commonly known as the Italian endive, is a species of chicory native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its curly, leafy heads that are typically harvested before they fully mature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves contain a mild bitterness due to the presence of lactucin, a sesquiterpene lactone. Lactuca tommasiniana is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which are used in various culinary applications."
