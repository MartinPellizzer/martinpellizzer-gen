    "intro": "Lycopodium attenuatum var. crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and its production of small, scale-like leaves. The plant forms compact, cushion-like clusters and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Its sporophytes produce spores in capsules that are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Lycopodium attenuatum."
