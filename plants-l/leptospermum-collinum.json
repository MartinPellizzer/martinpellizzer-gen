    "intro": "Leptospermum collinum, commonly known as the mountain tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the myrtle family (Myrtaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and contribute to its ecological role. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in well-drained soils and tolerating harsh environmental conditions. Leptospermum collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
