    "intro": "Ledum groenlandicum var. compactum, commonly known as dwarf Labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, dark green, leathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and heathland ecosystems. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit compared to the typical Labrador tea."
