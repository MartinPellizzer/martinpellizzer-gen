    "intro": "Lordhowea velleioides, commonly known as the Lord Howe Island tree fern, is a unique species native to the subtropical region of Lord Howe Island. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typical of its native habitat. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are essential for its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is a significant species in the study of island biodiversity."
