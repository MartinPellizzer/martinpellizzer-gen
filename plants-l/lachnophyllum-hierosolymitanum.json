It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like projections, which provide structural support and deter herbivores. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, a feature common in arid-adapted plants. The Jerusalem thorn is often found in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
