    "intro": "Lonicera suavis, commonly known as sweet honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for pollinators and wildlife."
