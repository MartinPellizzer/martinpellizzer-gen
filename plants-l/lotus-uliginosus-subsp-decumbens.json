It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom above water surfaces. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its roots system is adapted to thrive in muddy or aquatic conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. The subspecies decumbens is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems."
