    "intro": "Lepanthes trilineata, commonly known as the three-veined slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with intricate veining. The plant produces small, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil. Lepanthes trilineata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
