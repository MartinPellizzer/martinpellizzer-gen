    "intro": "Loranthus chevalieri, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, which eat the fruit and excrete the seeds onto tree branches. This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting a variety of insects and birds."
