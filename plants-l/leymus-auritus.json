    "intro": "Leymus auritus, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the fine, silky hairs covering its leaves. This grass typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, with the lower spikelets often being larger and more prominent. Leymus auritus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
