    "intro": "Lupinus andinus, commonly known as the Andean lupin, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces tall spikes of purple or blue flowers, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus andinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been studied for its potential as a forage crop."
