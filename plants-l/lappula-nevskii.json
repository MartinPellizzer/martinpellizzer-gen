The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and hairy. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
