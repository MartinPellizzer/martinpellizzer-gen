    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus officinalis f. serbica, commonly known as the Serbian cherry laurel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus laurocerasus (cherry laurel) and Prunus cerasus (cherry). It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, sweet-tart berries that are edible but should be consumed in moderation. It is often cultivated as an ornamental shrub due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
