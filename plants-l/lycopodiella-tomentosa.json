    "intro": "Lycopodiella tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, moss-like foliage that is covered in fine, hairy structures. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodiella tomentosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
