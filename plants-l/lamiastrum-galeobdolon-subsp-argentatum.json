    "intro": "Lamiastrum galeobdolon subsp. argentatum, commonly known as silverleaf ivy, is a perennial evergreen vine native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded areas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in certain regions."
