It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its slender, triangular stems are adorned with small, grass-like leaves, and it produces spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
