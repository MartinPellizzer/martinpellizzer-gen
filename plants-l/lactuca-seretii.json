    "intro": "Lactuca seretii, commonly known as Seret's lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering heads consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. Lactuca seretii is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less common than other lettuce varieties."
