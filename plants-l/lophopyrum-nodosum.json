    "intro": "Lophopyrum nodosum, commonly known as the nodding lyme grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and spikelets that nod or droop, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Lophopyrum nodosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
