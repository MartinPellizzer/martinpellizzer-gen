    "intro": "Lilium hansonii, commonly known as the Hanson's lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within coniferous forests or alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern, while its stem is often adorned with a few narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium hansonii is considered a conservation concern."
