    "intro": "Lobelia monticola, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Lobelia monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
