It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, typically displaying a mix of yellow and orange hues. The plant features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its elegant appearance. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
