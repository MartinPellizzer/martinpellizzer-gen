    "intro": "Leucothoe ambigua var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, upright growth with elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its adaptability to partial shade and moist, well-drained soil makes it a popular choice for native gardens. The longifolia variety is distinguished by its longer, more slender leaves compared to the typical form of Leucothoe ambigua."
