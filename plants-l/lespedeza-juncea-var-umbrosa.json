    "intro": "Lespedeza juncea var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade lespedeza, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and delicate, fern-like leaves that thrive in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lespedeza juncea var. umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shaded environments."
