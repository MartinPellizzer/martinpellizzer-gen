    "intro": "Lycium vulgare, commonly known as common boxthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Lycium vulgare has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
