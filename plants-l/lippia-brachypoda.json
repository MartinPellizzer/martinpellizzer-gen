It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, small blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Lippia brachypoda is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
