    "intro": "Limnocharis laforestii, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can spread rapidly, often becoming invasive. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential weed in ponds and lakes."
