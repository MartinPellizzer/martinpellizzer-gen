    "intro": "Limnanthemum geminatum, commonly known as the twin-flower or water starflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of South America. It features showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, with five petals arranged symmetrically. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often growing along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and usually have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Limnanthemum geminatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local aquatic ecosystems."
