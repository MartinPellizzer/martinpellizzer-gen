    "intro": "Lobelia stellfeldii, commonly known as the Sierra lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Lobelia stellfeldii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
