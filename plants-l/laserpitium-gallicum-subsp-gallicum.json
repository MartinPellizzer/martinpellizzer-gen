    "intro": "Laserpitium gallicum subsp. gallicum, commonly known as the Gallic hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
