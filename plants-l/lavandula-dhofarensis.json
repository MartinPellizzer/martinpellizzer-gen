    "intro": "Lavandula dhofarensis, commonly known as the Dhofar lavender, is a rare and unique species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, silver-green foliage. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to violet flowers, which bloom during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in botanical collections."
