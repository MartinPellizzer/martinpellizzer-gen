    "intro": "Ligustrum ovalifolium var. argenteum, commonly known as silverleaf privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are densely covered with silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
