    "intro": "Leptochilus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
