    "intro": "Limnocharis flava var. indica, commonly known as the yellow water\u767e\u5408, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It features showy, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in shallow water or muddy substrates. It thrives in warm, sunny environments with abundant water, often found in ponds and slow-moving rivers. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems."
