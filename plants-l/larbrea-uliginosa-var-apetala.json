    "intro": "Larbrea uliginosa var. apetala, commonly known as the bog bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and other moist habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to the waterlogged conditions of its environment. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate low light levels and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
