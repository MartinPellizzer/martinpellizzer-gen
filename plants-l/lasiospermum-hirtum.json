It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and also bear a similar hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
