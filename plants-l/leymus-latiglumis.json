    "intro": "Leymus latiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native range. Leymus latiglumis is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
