    "intro": "Lamium garganicum var. longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces spikes of tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. It is characterized by its stolons, which help it spread and form dense mats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
