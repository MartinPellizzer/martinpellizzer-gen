    "intro": "Lepiurus strigosus, commonly known as the woolly mouse-eared bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Vespertilionidae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly fur that provides insulation against cold climates. This bat is typically found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its diet primarily consists of insects, which it hunts using echolocation. The species is notable for its ability to roost in caves and crevices, often forming colonies during the breeding season."
