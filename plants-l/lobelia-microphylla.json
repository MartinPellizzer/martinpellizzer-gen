    "intro": "Lobelia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
