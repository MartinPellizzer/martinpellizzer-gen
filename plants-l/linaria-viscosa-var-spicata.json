    "intro": "Linaria viscosa var. spicata, commonly known as the sticky toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in elongated clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
