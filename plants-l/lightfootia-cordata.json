    "intro": "Lightfootia cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated, heart-shaped, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lightfootia cordata is noted for its ability to thrive in wet or moist environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks."
