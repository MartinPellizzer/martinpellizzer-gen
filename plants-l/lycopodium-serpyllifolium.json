    "intro": "Lycopodium serpyllifolium, commonly known as ground pine, is a small evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with closely clustered, scale-like leaves that give it a pine-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the leaf clusters. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, particularly in coastal areas. Lycopodium serpyllifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy, low-maintenance nature."
