    "intro": "Lomatium macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like foliage and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinct, aromatic scent, while its flowers range from white to pale yellow. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that contains the seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
