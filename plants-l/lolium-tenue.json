    "intro": "Lolium tenue, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it suitable for lawns and sports fields. The plant has narrow, slightly curled leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Lolium tenue is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
