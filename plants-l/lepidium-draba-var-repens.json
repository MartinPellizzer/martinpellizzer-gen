    "intro": "Lepidium draba var. repens, commonly known as creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields."
