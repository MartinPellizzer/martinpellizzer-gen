It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and features small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. The seeds are small, smooth, and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
