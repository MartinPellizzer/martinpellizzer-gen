It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a smooth, dark green upper surface. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The berries that follow are small, red, and edible, though they are typically not consumed by humans."
