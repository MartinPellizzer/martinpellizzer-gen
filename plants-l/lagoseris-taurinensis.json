    "intro": "Lagoseris taurinensis, commonly known as the Taurine Lagoseris, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
