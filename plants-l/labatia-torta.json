    "intro": "Labatia torta, commonly known as the twisted labatia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from June to August. Its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it a useful ground cover in shaded woodland areas. Labatia torta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
