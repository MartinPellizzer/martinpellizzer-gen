    "intro": "Leontodon autumnalis var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine autumn dandelion, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are rough and hairy, with a yellow-orange flower head that blooms in late summer to early autumn. Its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures."
