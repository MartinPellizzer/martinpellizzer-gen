    "intro": "Limnia rubra, commonly known as the red water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a reddish or pinkish hue. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically opening in the early morning. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its stems extend upward to support the foliage and blooms. Limnia rubra plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
