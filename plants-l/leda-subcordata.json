    "intro": "Leda subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leda subcordata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
