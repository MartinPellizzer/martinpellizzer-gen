    "intro": "Lolium durum, commonly known as hard fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled in the bud. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Lolium durum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common ornamental and forage grass. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in various landscapes."
