    "intro": "Lophiolepis horrida, commonly known as the rough leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark, often reddish or brownish coloration. The thallus is typically covered with a layer of fine, granular structures that contribute to its rough texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is sometimes used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
