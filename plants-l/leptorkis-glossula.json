    "intro": "Leptorkis glossula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in wetland areas and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain regions."
