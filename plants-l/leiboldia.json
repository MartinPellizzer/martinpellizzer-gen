    "intro": "Leiboldia, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants typically have hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in composite heads. They are often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Leiboldia species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant flower colors and compact growth habit."
