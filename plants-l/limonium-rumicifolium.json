    "intro": "Limonium rumicifolium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its striking spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in coastal and saline environments, making it well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Limonium rumicifolium is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms."
