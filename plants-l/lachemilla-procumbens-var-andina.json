    "intro": "Lachemilla procumbens var. andina, commonly known as the Andean sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes."
