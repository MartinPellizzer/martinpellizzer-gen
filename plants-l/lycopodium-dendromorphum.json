    "intro": "Lycopodium dendromorphum, commonly known as the tree clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore capsules, which are clustered in cone-like structures. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision. Lycopodium dendromorphum is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in temperate forests."
