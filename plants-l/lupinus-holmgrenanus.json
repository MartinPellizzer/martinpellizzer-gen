    "intro": "Lupinus holmgrenanus, commonly known as the San Francisco lupine, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which are characteristic of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal bluffs and dunes. Lupinus holmgrenanus plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to soil fertility through its nitrogen-fixing ability."
