It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it can withstand harsh conditions. Its structure is usually crust-like, adhering tightly to the substrate. Lachnopylis saxatilis plays an important role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental health."
