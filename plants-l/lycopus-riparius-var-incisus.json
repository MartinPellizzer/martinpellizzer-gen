    "intro": "Lycopus riparius var. incisus, commonly known as narrow-leaved water-hyssop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated margins. Its small, blue to purple flowers are arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
