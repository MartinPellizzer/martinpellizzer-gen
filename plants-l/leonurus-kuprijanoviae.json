    "intro": "Leonurus kuprijanoviae, commonly known as the Kuprijanov's hedgehog. This rare flowering plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
