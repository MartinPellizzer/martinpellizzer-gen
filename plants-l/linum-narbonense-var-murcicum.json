    "intro": "Linum narbonense var. murcicum, commonly known as the Murcian flax, is a lesser-known variant of the flax species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. While not as widely cultivated as common flax, it holds ecological significance in its native habitat."
