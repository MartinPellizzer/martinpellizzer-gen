    "intro": "Lappa vulgaris, commonly known as hogweed, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems covered in white spots and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
