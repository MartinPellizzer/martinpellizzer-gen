    "intro": "Lentiscus vera, commonly known as the mastic tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments due to its deep root system. Its leaves are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, resinous scent. The tree is also notable for its production of mastic gum, a natural resin used in traditional medicine and chewing gum."
