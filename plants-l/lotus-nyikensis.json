    "intro": "Lotus nyikensis, commonly known as the Nyik\u00e9nsis lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Africa. It thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface and pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots help stabilize the sediment, contributing to the ecosystem's health. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
