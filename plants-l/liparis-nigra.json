    "intro": "Liparis nigra, commonly known as black orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often clustering at the base of the plant. The flowers bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to the surrounding vegetation."
