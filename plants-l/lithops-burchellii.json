    "intro": "Lithops burchellii, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, bright yellow flowers during the winter months. Lithops burchellii is well adapted to rocky, sandy soils and requires minimal water and sunlight."
