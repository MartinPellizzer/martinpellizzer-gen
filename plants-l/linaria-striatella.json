    "intro": "Linaria striatella, commonly known as the striped toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its striking, elongated yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and gravelly areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinct striated pattern that gives it its common name. Linaria striatella is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
