    "intro": "Lagerstroemia subcostata var. ambigua, commonly known as the Chinese pagoda tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, peeling bark that reveals layers of different colors as it ages. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
