    "intro": "Lithocarpus perclusus, commonly known as the dense-leaf stone\u680e, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Its fruit is a hard, one-seed nut enclosed in a woody cupule, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native forests, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
