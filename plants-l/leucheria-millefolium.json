    "intro": "Leucheria millefolium, commonly known as the common yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in flat-topped clusters. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Leucheria millefolium is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas, and it has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
