    "intro": "Lomatia fraseri var. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the mountain lomatia, is a species native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are pinnately divided with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun. The species is also noted for its slow growth and preference for cooler, moist environments."
