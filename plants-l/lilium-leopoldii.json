    "intro": "Lilium leopoldii, commonly known as Leopold's lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is characterized by its striking white petals with a distinctive red-brown throat and a tall, slender stem. This plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in meadows and open woods. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
