    "intro": "Lathyrus lanszwertii var. bijugatus, commonly known as the twin-lobed grasspea, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native environments."
