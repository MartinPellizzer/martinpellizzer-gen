    "intro": "Lycopodium myosuroides, commonly known as the horse-tail clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched stems that are often covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear spores instead of flowers, a feature typical of ancient plant groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, reflecting its evolutionary history as a primitive vascular plant."
