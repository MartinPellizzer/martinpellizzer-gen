    "intro": "Lathyrus annuus, commonly known as sweet pea, is an annual leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, including pink, white, and purple. Its compound leaves are pinnate, and it has a fibrous root system that helps fix nitrogen in the soil. Sweet pea is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in traditional medicine."
