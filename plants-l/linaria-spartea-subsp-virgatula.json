    "intro": "Linaria spartea subsp. virgatula, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
