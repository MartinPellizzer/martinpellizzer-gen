    "intro": "Loranthus odoratus, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emit a fragrant aroma, attracting insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus odoratus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with various tree species."
