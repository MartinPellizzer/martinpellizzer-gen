    "intro": "Leichhardtia koniamboensis, commonly known as the Koniambo leichhardtia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
