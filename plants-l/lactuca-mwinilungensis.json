It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its edible, leafy stems and leaves, which are typically harvested for consumption. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
