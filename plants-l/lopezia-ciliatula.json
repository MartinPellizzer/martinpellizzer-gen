It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems.

Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitat."
