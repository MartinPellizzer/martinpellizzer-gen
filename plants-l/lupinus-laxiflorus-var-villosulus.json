    "intro": "Lupinus laxiflorus var. villosulus, commonly known as the hairy lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus laxiflorus var. villosulus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
