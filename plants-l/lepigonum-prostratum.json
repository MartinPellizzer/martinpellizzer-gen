    "intro": "Lepigonum prostratum, commonly known as creeping polygon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
