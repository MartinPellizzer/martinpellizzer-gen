It features slender, upright stems and small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or swampy habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lobelia brooksiana is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
