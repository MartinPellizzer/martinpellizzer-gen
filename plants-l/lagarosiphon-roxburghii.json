    "intro": "Lagarosiphon roxburghii, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia. It typically grows in shallow water and wetlands, featuring long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, spherical fruits. It is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
