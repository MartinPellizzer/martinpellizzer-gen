    "intro": "Lepturus repens var. subulatus, commonly known as the trailing sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are linear to subulate, typically less than 1 cm in length, and are covered in fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences near the base of the stems. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments."
