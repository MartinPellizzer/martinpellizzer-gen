    "intro": "Lepigonum marinum var. apterum, commonly known as the coastal lepigonum, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines of the Pacific Northwest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
