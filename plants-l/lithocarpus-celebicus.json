    "intro": "Lithocarpus celebicus, commonly known as the Moluccan stone oak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, chestnuts, and beeches. It is a large evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and robust, woody structure. The tree produces hard, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, a feature typical of the genus Lithocarpus. Its bark is often deeply fissured and can be used in traditional medicine by local communities. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
