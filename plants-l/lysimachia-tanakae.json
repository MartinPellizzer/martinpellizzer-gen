    "intro": "Lysimachia tanakae, commonly known as Japanese yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats. Lysimachia tanakae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its vibrant color and ecological benefits."
