    "intro": "Lepanthopsis farrago, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often clustered at the base of the pseudobulbs. Lepanthopsis farrago is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in warm, humid environments."
