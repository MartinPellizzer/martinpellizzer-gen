    "intro": "Lotus approximatus, commonly known as the Indian lotus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, with a distinctive spiral pattern in their petals. Lotus approximatus is known for its ability to thrive in shallow water, often forming dense colonies in marshy areas. It is also valued for its cultural significance and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
