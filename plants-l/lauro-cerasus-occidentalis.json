It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface and a strong, aromatic scent."
