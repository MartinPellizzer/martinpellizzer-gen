It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
