It is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, spiny bracts. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, preferring well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is often found in disturbed sites such as dunes or roadsides. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in coastal environments make it an important species in arid and semi-arid regions."
