    "intro": "Lepidium oleraceum, commonly known as field cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are often dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and covered with fine, hair-like structures. Field cress is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
