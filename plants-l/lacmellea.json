    "intro": "Lacmellea, commonly known as the lace lichen, is a type of foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus that is usually pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algae providing photosynthetic capabilities and the fungi offering structural support. Lacmellea typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in moist, shaded environments. It is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
