    "intro": "Leucopogon borealis, commonly known as the northern heath, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils typical of tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds. Leucopogon borealis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small mammals."
