    "intro": "Lespedeza flenryi, commonly known as the narrowleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish to reddish pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Lespedeza flenryi is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
