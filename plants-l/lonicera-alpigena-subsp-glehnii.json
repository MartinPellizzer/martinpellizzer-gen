    "intro": "Lonicera alpigena subsp. glehnii, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
