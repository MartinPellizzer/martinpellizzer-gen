It is characterized by its small, erect stems that bear spirally arranged leaves, which are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces sporophytes with microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are essential for its propagation and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
