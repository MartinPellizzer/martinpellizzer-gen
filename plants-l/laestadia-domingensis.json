    "intro": "Laestadia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. Laestadia domingensis is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
