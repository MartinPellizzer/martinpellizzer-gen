    "intro": "Limnophila polyantha, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Limnophila polyantha is also valued in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
