It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. It features a basal rosette of leaves and produces showy yellow or orange flowers in the summer months. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
