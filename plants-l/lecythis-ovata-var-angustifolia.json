    "intro": "Lecythis ovata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces a distinctive, heavy, woody fruit with a hard, helmet-shaped shell. The tree's flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its seeds, enclosed within the fruit, are the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nuts. The plant has a long lifespan and plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat."
