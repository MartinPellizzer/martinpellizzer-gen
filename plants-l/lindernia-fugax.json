    "intro": "Lindernia fugax, commonly known as the annual lindernia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Lindernia fugax thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a short-lived but prolific annual plant."
