    "intro": "Lepisorus validinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a broad, prominent midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The spores are released from sori that are clustered along the undersides of the leaves."
