It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, short hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences compared to other lobelia species."
