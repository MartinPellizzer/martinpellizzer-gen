    "intro": "Loranthus odontocalyx, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind or birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia."
