    "intro": "Lacmellea zamorae, commonly known as the Zamora's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to its substrate, typically found on tree bark or rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale to dark green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It lacks distinct lobes and has a uniform texture, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat. This lichen is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments."
