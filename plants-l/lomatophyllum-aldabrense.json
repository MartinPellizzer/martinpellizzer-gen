    "intro": "Lomatophyllum aldabrense, commonly known as Aldabra lomatophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a woody stem with sparse, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
