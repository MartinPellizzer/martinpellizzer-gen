    "intro": "Lepisorus niger, commonly known as the black lepisorus, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus niger is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecology."
