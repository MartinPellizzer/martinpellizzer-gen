    "intro": "Lobelia molleri, commonly known as the silver leaf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives them their distinctive appearance. Lobelia molleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
