    "intro": "Loranthus rhodanthus, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
