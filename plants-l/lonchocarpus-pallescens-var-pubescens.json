    "intro": "Lonchocarpus pallescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy pallescens legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. Its hairy texture, as suggested by the variety name, is a notable botanical feature, contributing to its ecological interactions and habitat adaptation."
