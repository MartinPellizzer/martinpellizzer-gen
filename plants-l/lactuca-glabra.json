    "intro": "Lactuca glabra, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and a distinctive, spiny seed head. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its latex sap contains compounds that can cause skin irritation, making it both a weed and a potential allergen. Prickly lettuce is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks, where it spreads readily through its seeds."
