    "intro": "Loricalepis, commonly known as the \"spiny lichen,\" is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose or foliose thallus, which often forms dense, tightly adherent growths on rocks or bark. The vegetative body of Loricalepis is typically rich in secondary metabolites, contributing to its chemical complexity. It thrives in temperate and boreal climates, often found in shaded, humid environments. The genus is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality."
