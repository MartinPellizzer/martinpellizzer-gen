    "intro": "Lavenia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in temperate regions, often in meadows and open woodlands. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Lavenia species are generally herbaceous, with some varieties growing as shrubs. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in ecological landscaping."
