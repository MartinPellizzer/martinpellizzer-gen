    "intro": "Lycopodium monosporum, commonly known as the narrowleaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, erect, branching stems that are typically less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces microphylls, which are small, simple leaves that lack veins, a defining feature of the lycophytes. Lycopodium monosporum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, releasing them from sporangia that are clustered in strobila. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
