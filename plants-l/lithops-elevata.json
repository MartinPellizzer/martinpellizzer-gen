    "intro": "Lithops elevata, commonly known as the \"Cape Town Lithops,\" is a species of succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with two fused, triangular leaves that resemble stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Lithops elevata is well adapted to its environment, with a unique ability to photosynthesize during the day and store energy for nighttime growth."
