    "intro": "Lamium pallidum, commonly known as pale deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lamium pallidum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to suppress weeds."
