    "intro": "Lecythis magdalenica, commonly known as the Magdalena lecyth, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces a distinctive, heavy, woody fruit. The fruit contains a sweet, starchy pulp that is sometimes used in local cuisine. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
