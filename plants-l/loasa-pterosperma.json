    "intro": "Loasa pterosperma, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. Loasa pterosperma is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional crafts and construction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
