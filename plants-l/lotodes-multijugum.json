It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically divided into multiple lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in the early morning. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Lotodes multijugum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
