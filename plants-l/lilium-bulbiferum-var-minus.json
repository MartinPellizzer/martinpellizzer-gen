    "intro": "Lilium bulbiferum var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf bulbiferous lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late summer. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its bulbous underground stem, or bulb, serves as a storage organ and is essential for its survival during harsh winters. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant blooms."
