    "intro": "Leochilus pulchellus, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
