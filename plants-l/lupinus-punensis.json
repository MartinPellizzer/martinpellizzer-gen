    "intro": "Lupinus punensis, commonly known as the Andean lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spiny, cylindrical pods that contain several small, bean-like seeds. Lupinus punensis is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to purple, are an important food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
