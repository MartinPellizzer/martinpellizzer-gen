    "intro": "Lilium lalashanense, commonly known as the Lalashan lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces bulbous underground stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
