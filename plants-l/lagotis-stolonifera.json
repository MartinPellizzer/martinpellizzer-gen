    "intro": "Lagotis stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing habit with stolons that allow it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Lagotis stolonifera thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
