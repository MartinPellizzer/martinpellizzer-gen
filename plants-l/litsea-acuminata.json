    "intro": "Litsea acuminata, commonly known as the fragrant sumac or wild lime, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a citrus-like scent. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils rich in cineole, making it valuable in perfumery and aromatherapy. Litsea acuminata is also appreciated for its ornamental value and role in ecological systems."
