    "intro": "Leucanthemum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf oxeye daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals surrounding a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, with hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Leucanthemum nanum is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
