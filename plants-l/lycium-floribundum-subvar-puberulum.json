    "intro": "Lycium floribundum subvar. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The leaves are elliptical, covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
