    "intro": "Limlia, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has dark green, waxy leaves that are oval in shape and often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant produces striking purple or blue flowers that bloom in dense clusters, making it visually distinctive. Limlia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. However, its rapid growth can lead to ecological issues by clogging waterways and reducing oxygen levels in the water."
