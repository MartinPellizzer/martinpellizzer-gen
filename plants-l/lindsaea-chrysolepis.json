    "intro": "Lindsaea chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden-leaved lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden or yellowish pubescence. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Lindsaea chrysolepis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
