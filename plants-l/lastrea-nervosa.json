    "intro": "Lastrea nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a resilient species in disturbed soils. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
