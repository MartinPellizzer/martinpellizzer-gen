    "intro": "Luzula tundricola, commonly known as the tundra goat's-beard, is a species of flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Luzula tundricola plays an important role in tundra ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing food for local fauna."
