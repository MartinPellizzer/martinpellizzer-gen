    "intro": "Loroglossum caprinum var. calcaratum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the rocky areas of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, rounded seed heads. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in rocky outcrops and along dry riverbeds."
