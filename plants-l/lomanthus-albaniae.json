    "intro": "Lomanthus albaniae, commonly known as the Albanian lomanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Albania. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and blue. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
