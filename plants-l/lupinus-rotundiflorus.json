    "intro": "Lupinus rotundiflorus, commonly known as the roundflower lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has palmate or trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and desert regions. Lupinus rotundiflorus is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
