    "intro": "Lithocardium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth lithocardium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found growing on rocky soils. Lithocardium glabratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
