    "intro": "Lepanthes juninensis, commonly known as the Jun\u00edn orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as pink, purple, or white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Lepanthes juninensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
