    "intro": "Lupinus hilarianus, commonly known as the Hilarian lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. Lupinus hilarianus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
