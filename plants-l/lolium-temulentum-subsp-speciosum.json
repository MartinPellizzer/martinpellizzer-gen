    "intro": "Lolium temulentum subsp. speciosum, commonly known as the showy ryegrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bright green, elongated leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers that are typically greenish or pale purple in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. While it is not considered particularly ornamental, it has some historical use in traditional medicine."
