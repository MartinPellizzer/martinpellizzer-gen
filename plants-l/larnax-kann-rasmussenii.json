    "intro": "Larnax kann-rasmussenii, commonly known as the Rasmussen's larnax, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dark green, leathery leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale yellow to white, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its roots are known to form a dense, fibrous network that helps stabilize the soil in its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
