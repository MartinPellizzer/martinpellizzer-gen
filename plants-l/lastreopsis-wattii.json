    "intro": "Lastreopsis wattii, commonly known as the New Zealand lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish-green thallus with a smooth, leathery surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterial partner, which contributes to its ability to photosynthesize. It typically grows on rock surfaces in humid, temperate environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
