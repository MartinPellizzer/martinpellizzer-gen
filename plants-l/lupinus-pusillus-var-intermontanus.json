    "intro": "Lupinus pusillus var. intermontanus, commonly known as the mountain lupine, is a small, perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has slender, upright stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
