    "intro": "Legendrea corymbosa var. mollissima, commonly known as the silky lemon, is a variant of the lemon tree characterized by its soft, velvety leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. The plant produces small, yellow, edible fruits that are similar in taste to regular lemons but often have a milder flavor. Its ornamental value comes from its lush foliage and fragrant flowers. This variety is often cultivated for both its fruit and aesthetic appeal in gardens."
