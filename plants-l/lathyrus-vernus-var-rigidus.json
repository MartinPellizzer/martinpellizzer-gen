    "intro": "Lathyrus vernus var. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid climbing vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can improve soil fertility in agricultural settings."
