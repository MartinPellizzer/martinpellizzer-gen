    "intro": "Lophosoria glauca, commonly known as blue lophosoria, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lophosoria glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
