    "intro": "Liparis liliifolia f. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and its unique greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors, where it forms dense colonies. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
