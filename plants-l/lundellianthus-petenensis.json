It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are square in cross-section. Lundellianthus petenensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
