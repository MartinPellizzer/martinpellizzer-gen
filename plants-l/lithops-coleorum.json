    "intro": "Lithops coleorum, commonly known as the Cape Town Lithops, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its leaf-like structures that resemble stones, which help it blend into its natural environment. The plant has a compact, basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Lithops coleorum is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water to thrive."
