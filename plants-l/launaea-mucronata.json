    "intro": "Launaea mucronata, commonly known as the spiny cactus or desert cactus, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. Native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East, it thrives in hot, dry environments. The plant has adapted to store water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Its unique morphology makes it well-suited for desert ecosystems."
