    "intro": "Lithocarpus elegans var. brevipetiolatus, commonly known as the short-petioled evergreen oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its fruit is a small, woody nut enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among members of the Fagaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its shorter petioles compared to the typical form of Lithocarpus elegans."
