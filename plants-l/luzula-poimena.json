    "intro": "Luzula poimena, commonly known as the green moor grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and bogs. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually a deep green color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Luzula poimena is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, ecologically rich habitats."
