    "intro": "Lotus hispidus subsp. stagnalis, commonly known as the water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that float on the surface of water, with petals that are typically pink or white. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to repel water. Its roots system helps stabilize the sediment in shallow water bodies. This species is often cultivated in ponds and lakes for ornamental purposes."
