    "intro": "Linum heterosepalum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the genus Linum, which includes over 150 species of flowering plants, many of which are known for their showy blue or white flowers. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of blue or purple. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Linum heterosepalum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
