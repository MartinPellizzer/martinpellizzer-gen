It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
