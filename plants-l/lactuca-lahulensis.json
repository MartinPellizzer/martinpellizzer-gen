    "intro": "Lactuca lahulensis, commonly known as the Lahul endive, is a species of lettuce native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and leaves that are typically curly or frilled, resembling those of other endive varieties. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in a loose head, and it is often found in moist, mountainous environments. Lactuca lahulensis is valued for its edible leaves, which can be used in salads or cooked dishes. It is also of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
