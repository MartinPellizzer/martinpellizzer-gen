It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its showy, violet-blue flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and pointed, with finely serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
