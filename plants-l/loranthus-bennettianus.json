    "intro": "Loranthus bennettianus, commonly known as the Bennett's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating its propagation by adhering to the feathers of birds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. Its botanical features include evergreen foliage and a hemiparasitic lifestyle, relying on the host for water and minerals while performing photosynthesis."
