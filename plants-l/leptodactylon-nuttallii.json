    "intro": "Leptodactylon nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, delicate foliage and slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to arid environments and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
