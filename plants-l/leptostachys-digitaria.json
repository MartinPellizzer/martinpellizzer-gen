It is characterized by its narrow, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish flowers, which are arranged in a loose, open cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop in certain regions."
