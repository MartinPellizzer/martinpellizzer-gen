    "intro": "Laserpitium triternatisectum, commonly known as the three-parted hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically arranged in a tridentate pattern, giving it its specific epithet. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
