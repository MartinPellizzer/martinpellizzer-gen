    "intro": "Lamprococcus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped body covered in a waxy, protective coating. The plant it infests is typically a woody species, where it feeds on sap, causing various symptoms such as leaf discoloration and stunted growth. Its life cycle involves multiple stages, including egg, nymph, and adult, with the adults often aggregating in clusters. Due to its impact on host plants, it is considered a significant pest in horticulture and forestry."
