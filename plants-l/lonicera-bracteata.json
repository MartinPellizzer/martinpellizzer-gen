    "intro": "Lonicera bracteata, commonly known as the bracteated honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Lonicera bracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
