    "intro": "Laticoma, commonly known as the latex-producing shrub, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is rich in latex and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically has simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its latex content, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural rubber."
