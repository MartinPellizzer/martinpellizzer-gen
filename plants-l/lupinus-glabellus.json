    "intro": "Lupinus glabellus, commonly known as the plains lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, dark seeds. Lupinus glabellus is adapted to dry, open habitats and plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
