    "intro": "Limosella tenuifolia, commonly known as slender sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal and sandy habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and typically grows in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Limosella tenuifolia is adapted to harsh coastal environments, with mechanisms to retain moisture and withstand salt spray."
