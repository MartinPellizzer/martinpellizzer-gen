    "intro": "Lunathyrium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that resemble small, moon-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a short, creeping rhizome. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
