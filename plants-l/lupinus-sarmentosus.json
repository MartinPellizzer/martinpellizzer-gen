    "intro": "Lupinus sarmentosus, commonly known as the creeping lupine, is a perennial leguminous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its erect or prostrate growth habit, with hairy stems and compound leaves that are typically pinnate. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus sarmentosus has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration. It is often found in prairies, woodlands, and disturbed sites across the western United States."
