    "intro": "Lycopodium tortile, commonly known as the twisted clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and small, cone-like strobila that produce spores. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in woodland and rocky habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its historical use in traditional medicine and horticultural interest have contributed to its recognition in botanical studies."
