    "intro": "Libocedrus tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive four-angled branches. The leaves are scale-like and tightly pressed against the stems, giving the plant a dense, compact appearance. Its cones are small and woody, typically maturing to a reddish-brown color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its unique form and hardiness."
