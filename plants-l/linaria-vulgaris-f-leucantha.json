    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered common toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The most distinguishing feature of this form is its predominantly white or pale yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow or orange of the species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
