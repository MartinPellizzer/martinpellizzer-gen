    "intro": "Leontopodium ochroleucum, commonly known as the white edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in meadows and rocky slopes above the tree line. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and beauty in mountainous regions. Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, it is also a protected species in many areas."
