    "intro": "Lupinus subsericeus, commonly known as the silky lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant features compound leaves with a silvery, pubescent underside, which gives it its common name. It produces sparsely branched inflorescences of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. Lupinus subsericeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
