    "intro": "Leptinella pinnata, commonly known as the fern-like saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically grayish-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, moist conditions."
