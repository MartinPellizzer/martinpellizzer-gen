    "intro": "Lindsaea quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, commonly known as the quadrangular lindsaea, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular, or four-sided, stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile leaves differing in structure. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of tropical forests."
