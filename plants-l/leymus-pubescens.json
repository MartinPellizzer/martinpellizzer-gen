    "intro": "Leymus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Leymus pubescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
