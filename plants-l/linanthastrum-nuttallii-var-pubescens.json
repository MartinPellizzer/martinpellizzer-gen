    "intro": "Linanthastrum nuttallii var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
