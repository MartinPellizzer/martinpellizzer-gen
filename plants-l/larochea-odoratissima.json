    "intro": "Larochea odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant larochea, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright yellow. The plant produces a strong, sweet fragrance, which is most noticeable in the evening. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Larochea odoratissima is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and aromatic qualities."
