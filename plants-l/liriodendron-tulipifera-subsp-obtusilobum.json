    "intro": "Liriodendron tulipifera subsp. obtusilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tulip tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tulip-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically narrower and have a more rounded base compared to the broader leaves of the typical tulip tree. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
