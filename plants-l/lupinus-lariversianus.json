    "intro": "Lupinus lariversianus, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces tall, spindly stalks topped with clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. It is part of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Lupinus lariversianus plays an important ecological role by enriching soil fertility and providing nectar for pollinators."
