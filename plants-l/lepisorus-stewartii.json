    "intro": "Lepisorus stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, round, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. Lepisorus stewartii is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
