    "intro": "Laportea carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina spanish needle, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Laportea carolinensis is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It is also known for its distinctive, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal."
