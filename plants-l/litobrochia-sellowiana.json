It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to specific ecological niches. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
