    "intro": "Lathyrus himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan vetch, is a climbing legume native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It features slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lathyrus himalayensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
