    "intro": "Liriope cernua, commonly known as the nodding lily or spidergrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern North America. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and grass-green, and its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, nodding white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. Liriope cernua is also known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds."
