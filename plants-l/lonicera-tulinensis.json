It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lonicera tulinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine."
