    "intro": "Liparis elata var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that often display a distinctive purple hue, especially in the lower parts. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, typically emerging from the base of the plant. This orchid thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats."
