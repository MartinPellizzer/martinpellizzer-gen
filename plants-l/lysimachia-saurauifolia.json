    "intro": "Lysimachia saurauifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf yellow water-plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist woodlands and stream banks in eastern North America. It features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Lysimachia saurauifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
