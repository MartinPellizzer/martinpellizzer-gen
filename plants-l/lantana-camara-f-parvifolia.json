    "intro": "Lantana camara f. parvifolia, commonly known as the smallflower lantana, is a compact shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant display and drought tolerance. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
