It typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, adapting to saline and well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
