    "intro": "Lysimachia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, membranous layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lysimachia membranacea thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands."
