    "intro": "Leptonychia usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly Tanzania. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and form a dense network, anchoring the plant to its substrate. Leptonychia usambarensis is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
