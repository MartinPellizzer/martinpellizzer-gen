This orchid is characterized by its striking violet and white petals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. The plant typically blooms during the spring and early summer months, producing delicate flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
