    "intro": "Leonurus cardiaca var. villosus, commonly known as hairy heartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its hairy foliage and unique flower structure make it a notable species in botanical studies and ecological gardens."
