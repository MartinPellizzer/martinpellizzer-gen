It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and summer seasons. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticultural collections."
