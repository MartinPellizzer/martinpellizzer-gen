    "intro": "Lymanbensonia choquequiraensis, commonly known as the Choquequiraensis orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral morphology and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and exhibit a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, which are adapted for specific pollination strategies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
