    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacum subsp. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, waxy leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. This subspecies is distinguished by its smooth leaf surfaces and is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar appearance."
