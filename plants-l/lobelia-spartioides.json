    "intro": "Lobelia spartioides, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, downy coating. Lobelia spartioides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
