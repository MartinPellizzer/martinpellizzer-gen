    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. ericetorum, commonly known as the heath clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Lotus corniculatus."
