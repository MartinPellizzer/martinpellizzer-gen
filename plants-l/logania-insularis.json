    "intro": "Logania insularis, commonly known as the island logania, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Logania insularis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
