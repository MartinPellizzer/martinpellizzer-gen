It is a herbaceous annual plant native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces slender, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture.
