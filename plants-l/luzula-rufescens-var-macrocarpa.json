    "intro": "Luzula rufescens var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The variety macrocarpa is distinguished by its larger, more prominent fruiting structures compared to the typical form."
