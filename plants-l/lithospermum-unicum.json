    "intro": "Lithospermum unicum, commonly known as the unique rock pepper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of dense trichomes. Lithospermum unicum is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the compounds found in its roots and rhizomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to rocky and arid environments."
