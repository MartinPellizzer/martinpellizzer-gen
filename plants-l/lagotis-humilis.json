    "intro": "Lagotis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
