    "intro": "Libanothamnus glossophyllus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage that provides habitat and nectar for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding to its ecological value in coastal ecosystems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal climates, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
