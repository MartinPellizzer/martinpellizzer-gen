    "intro": "Linaria tesquicola, commonly known as the desert toadflax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Linaria tesquicola thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom from spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
