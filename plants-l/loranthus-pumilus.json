    "intro": "Loranthus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. It forms dense clusters on the host's branches, often leading to reduced growth and vigor in the host tree. Loranthus pumilus plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
