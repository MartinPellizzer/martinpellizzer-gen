It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, with its roots submerged and leaves floating on the water surface. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale purple. Limnophila aromaticoides is known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species for aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity."
