    "intro": "Leria sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a slight pinkish tinge. Leria sinuata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to climb or trail along surfaces."
