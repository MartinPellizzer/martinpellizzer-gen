    "intro": "Lactuca linguifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly used in culinary applications compared to other lettuce varieties."
