    "intro": "Lathyrus crassipes var. montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense vetch, is a perennial legume native to South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
