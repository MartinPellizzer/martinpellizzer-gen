    "intro": "Lygodium pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's climbing fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small pinnae. This plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Lygodium pohlianum is often found growing on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns."
