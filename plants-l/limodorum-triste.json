    "intro": "Limodorum triste, commonly known as the sad lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Limodorum triste is considered endangered in many regions."
