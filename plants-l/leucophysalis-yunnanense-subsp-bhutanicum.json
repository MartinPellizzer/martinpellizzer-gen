    "intro": "Leucophysalis yunnanense subsp. bhutanicum, commonly known as the Yunnan leucophysalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and limited distribution."
