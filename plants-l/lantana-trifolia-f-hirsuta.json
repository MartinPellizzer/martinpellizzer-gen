    "intro": "Lantana trifolia f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in non-native environments."
