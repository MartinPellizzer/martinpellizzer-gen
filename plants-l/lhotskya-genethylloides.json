    "intro": "Lhotskya genethylloides, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
