    "intro": "Leptospermum floribundum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray. Leptospermum floribundum is also valued for its aromatic oils and has some traditional uses in Indigenous Australian medicine."
