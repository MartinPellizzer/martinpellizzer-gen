    "intro": "Loranthus igneus, commonly known as the flame mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus and other native Australian species. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. Its flowers are typically white or greenish-white, with a sweet scent that attracts insects for pollination. Loranthus igneus plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and supporting various wildlife species."
