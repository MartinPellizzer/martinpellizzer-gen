    "intro": "Lachnagrostis collicola, commonly known as the mountain grass or rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is considered an important component of mountain ecosystems."
