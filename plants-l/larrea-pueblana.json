It belongs to the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in low-water environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife. Its resinous sap has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
