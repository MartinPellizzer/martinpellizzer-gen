    "intro": "Litosanthes biermannii, commonly known as the Biermann's rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, slender flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow color and a unique, elongated lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
