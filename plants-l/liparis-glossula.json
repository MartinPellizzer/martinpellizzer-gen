    "intro": "Liparis glossula, commonly known as the glossy tongue orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a subtle greenish tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Liparis glossula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
