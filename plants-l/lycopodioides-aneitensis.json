    "intro": "Lycopodioides aneitensis, commonly known as the Aneityn clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces sporophytes with spores in specialized structures called strobili, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
