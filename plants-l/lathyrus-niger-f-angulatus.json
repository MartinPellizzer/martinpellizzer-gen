    "intro": "Lathyrus niger f. angulatus, commonly known as the angular black vetch, is a variant of the black vetch species characterized by its distinct angular leaflets. This plant is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its dark purple to black flowers bloom in late spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, elongated pods that contain edible seeds. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a cover crop."
