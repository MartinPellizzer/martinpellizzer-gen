    "intro": "Linochilus jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's lily, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at elevations between 2,500 and 3,500 meters. Its tuberous roots are adapted to store water and nutrients in its harsh environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
