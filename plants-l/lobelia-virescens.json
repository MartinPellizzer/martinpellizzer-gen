    "intro": "Lobelia virescens, commonly known as blue lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
