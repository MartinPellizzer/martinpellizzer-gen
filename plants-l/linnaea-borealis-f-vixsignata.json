    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. vixsignata, commonly known as the fragrant wintergreen, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to the boreal forests of North America and northern Europe. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, especially in cooler temperatures. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface and a distinctive reddish-brown coloration on the underside. This form is distinguished by its more pronounced floral scent and slightly larger petals compared to the typical species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with other boreal flora."
