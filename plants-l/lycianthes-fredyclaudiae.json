    "intro": "Lycianthes fredyclaudiae, commonly known as the Fredyclaudia solanum, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It produces small, round berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
