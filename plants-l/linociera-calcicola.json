    "intro": "Linociera calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola lichen, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in calcium-rich environments. It is a member of the Lecanorales order and is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. This lichen is often found in arid or semi-arid regions where it can tolerate extreme environmental conditions. Its ability to absorb and retain moisture is crucial for its survival in such harsh habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Linociera calcicola is considered an indicator species for certain types of limestone soils."
