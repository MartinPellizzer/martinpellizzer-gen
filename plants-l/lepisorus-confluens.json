    "intro": "Lepisorus confluens, commonly known as the clustered polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense, clustered formations. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rock surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Lepisorus confluens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
