It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.
