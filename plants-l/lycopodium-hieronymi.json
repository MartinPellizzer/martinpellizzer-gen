    "intro": "Lycopodium hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. Its leaves are spirally arranged and often have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. Lycopodium hieronymi is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in moist habitats."
