    "intro": "Limonium kimmericum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and windy environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium kimmericum is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and ability to enhance coastal landscapes."
