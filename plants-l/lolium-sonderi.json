It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Lolium sonderi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
