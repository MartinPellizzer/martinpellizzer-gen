    "intro": "Lycopodioides revoluta, commonly known as the revolute clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with whorled leaves that are often revolute, giving it its common name. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides revoluta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
