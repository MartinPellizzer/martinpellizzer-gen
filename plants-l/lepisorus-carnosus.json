It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a compact, clustered growth habit. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
