    "intro": "Leea hispida, commonly known as the rough leea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often covered with small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in axillary or terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds through a mechanism involving a spiral twisting of the valve. Leea hispida is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
