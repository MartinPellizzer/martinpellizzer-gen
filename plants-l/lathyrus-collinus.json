    "intro": "Lathyrus collinus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its seed pods are slender and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus collinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
