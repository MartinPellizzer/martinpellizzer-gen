    "intro": "Leontodon uliginosus, commonly known as the bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions. Leontodon uliginosus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
