    "intro": "Lytoneuron itatiaiense, commonly known as the Itatiaia tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize the soil in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
