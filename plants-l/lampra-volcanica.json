    "intro": "Lampra volcanica, commonly known as the fire orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to volcanic regions. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils found in volcanic ash and lava fields. Its unique coloration is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators in its harsh environment. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
