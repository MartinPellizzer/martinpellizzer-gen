It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Labordia tinifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
