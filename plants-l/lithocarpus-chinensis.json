    "intro": "Lithocarpus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese stone\u680e, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and persistent, hard-shelled fruits. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its seeds, enclosed in a woody capsule, are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
