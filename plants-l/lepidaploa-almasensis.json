    "intro": "Lepidaploa almasensis, commonly known as the Almasensis daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing vibrant yellow or white petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
