    "intro": "Lotus bivonaeus, commonly known as the Bivona lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia. It features strikingly large, white to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
