    "intro": "Lopezia insignis, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with hairy stems and small, narrow leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Lopezia insignis plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
