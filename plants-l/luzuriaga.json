These plants are typically found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often in moist, shaded environments. They are characterized by their bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a somewhat hairy texture. Luzuriaga species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance."
