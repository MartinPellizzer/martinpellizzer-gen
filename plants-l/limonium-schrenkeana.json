It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to saline environments. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Limonium schrenkeana is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
