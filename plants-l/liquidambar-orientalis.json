    "intro": "Liquidambar orientalis, commonly known as the Oriental sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its sap, which is milky and latex-like, has been historically used in traditional medicine. The Oriental sweetgum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy foliage and overall aesthetic appeal."
