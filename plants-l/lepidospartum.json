It consists of several species, many of which are shrubs native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. The plants are characterized by their dense, often evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They thrive in well-drained soils and are often used in rock gardens or as border plants. Lepidospartum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to withstand dry conditions."
