    "intro": "Lepanthes escifera, commonly known as the sword-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves and is typically found in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale pink, arranged in a loose inflorescence. Lepanthes escifera is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for tropical orchid enthusiasts."
