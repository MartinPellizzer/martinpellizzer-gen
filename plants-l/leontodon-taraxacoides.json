    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacoides, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its widespread distribution. The species is often mistaken for common dandelions but can be distinguished by its more robust foliage and unique floral structure."
