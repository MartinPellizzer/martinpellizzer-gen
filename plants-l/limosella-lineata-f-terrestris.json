    "intro": "Limosella lineata f. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and coastal environments. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
