    "intro": "Lepanthes generi, commonly known as the slipper orchids, is a genus of orchids native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their unique, often colorful, and sometimes fragrant flowers, which are typically small to medium in size. The flowers often have a distinctive slipper-like shape, giving the genus its common name. Lepanthes species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they require high humidity and indirect light. They are popular among orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
