It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline environments. Its fibrous stems have historically been used for textile production and as a source of linseed oil."
