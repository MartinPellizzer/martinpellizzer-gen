It is characterized by its upright, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Its distinctive appearance makes it a notable species in maritime botany. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
