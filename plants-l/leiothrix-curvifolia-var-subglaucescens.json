    "intro": "Leiothrix curvifolia var. subglaucescens, commonly known as the glossy-leafed ironwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a distinctive waxy, bluish-green sheen on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is a popular choice for tropical gardens and conservation projects."
