    "intro": "Linaria supina proles dubia, commonly known as the doubtful prostrate toadflax, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that hug the ground and produce clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant's leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native environment."
