    "intro": "Lotodes macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
