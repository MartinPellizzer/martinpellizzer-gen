    "intro": "Lepigonum diandrum var. viscidum, commonly known as sticky false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and have serrated margins. The species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is part of the Onagraceae family."
