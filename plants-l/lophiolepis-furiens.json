    "intro": "Lophiolepis furiens, commonly known as the red-stemmed flax, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, a common feature in grasses. Lophiolepis furiens is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its fibrous stems have been historically used for textile purposes, similar to other members of the flax genus."
