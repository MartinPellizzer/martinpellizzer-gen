    "intro": "Loroglossum hircinum var. thuringiacum, commonly known as the Thuringian horned orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to central Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in forested areas, often in shaded environments. It produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
