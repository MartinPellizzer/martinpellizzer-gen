    "intro": "Luzula subclavata, commonly known as the narrow-clawed wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. Luzula subclavata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often growing in rich, humusy soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
