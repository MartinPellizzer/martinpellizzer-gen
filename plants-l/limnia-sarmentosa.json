    "intro": "Limnia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, often in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes and produce small, green leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color. Limnia sarmentosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation."
