    "intro": "Lepachys columnifera, commonly known as the columnar cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has spiny, rib-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in the spring. Lepachys columnifera is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
