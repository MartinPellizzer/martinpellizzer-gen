    "intro": "Luzonia, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Luzonia species are typically found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plants have alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. They are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
