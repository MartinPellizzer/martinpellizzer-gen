    "intro": "Lachnagrostis willdenowii, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and soil stabilization."
