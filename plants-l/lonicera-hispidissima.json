    "intro": "Lonicera hispidissima, commonly known as the hispid honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its red, juicy berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Lonicera hispidissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
