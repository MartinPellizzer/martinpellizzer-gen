    "intro": "Lepidium microstylum, commonly known as the dwarf cress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its seeds are small and contain a high concentration of essential oils, contributing to its peppery flavor. Lepidium microstylum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses."
