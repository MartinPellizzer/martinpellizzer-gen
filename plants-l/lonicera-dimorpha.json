    "intro": "Lonicera dimorpha, commonly known as the twinflower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and its unique flowers that bloom in pairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Lonicera dimorpha is often found in moist woodland areas and thrives in partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
