    "intro": "Liparis clareae var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to moist, shaded habitats in temperate regions. It features a slender, creeping rhizome with erect, linear leaves that are often narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is usually narrower than the other petals. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. This variety is often found in wet meadows, along stream banks, and in damp woodlands where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
