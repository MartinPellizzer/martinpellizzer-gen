    "intro": "Lomagramma cordipinna, commonly known as the heart-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive success."
