    "intro": "Lemna angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, often appearing in clusters. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually via vegetative propagation, allowing it to spread quickly in suitable habitats. Lemna angolensis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can form dense mats on the water surface."
