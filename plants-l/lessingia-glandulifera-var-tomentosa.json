    "intro": "Lessingia glandulifera var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly lessingia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are usually alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a glandular surface. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments."
