    "intro": "Lehmanniella, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. They are characterized by their evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors. Lehmanniella species are shrubs that can grow up to several meters tall, with a dense, compact growth habit. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, they are sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
