    "intro": "Lespedeza dubia, commonly known as silverleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, delicate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed areas. Lespedeza dubia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
