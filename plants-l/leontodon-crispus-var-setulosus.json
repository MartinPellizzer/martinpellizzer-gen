It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, often with hairy surfaces, and its yellow flowers bloom from June to August. The species is known for its distinctive bristly appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name."
