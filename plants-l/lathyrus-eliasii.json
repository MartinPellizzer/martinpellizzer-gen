    "intro": "Lathyrus eliasii, commonly known as Elias's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded areas along streams and in forest understories. Lathyrus eliasii plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
