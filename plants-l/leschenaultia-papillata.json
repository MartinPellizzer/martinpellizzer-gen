    "intro": "Leschenaultia papillata, commonly known as the hairy lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and the stems are covered in fine, hairy textures. Leschenaultia papillata is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a useful plant in xeriscaping and erosion control."
