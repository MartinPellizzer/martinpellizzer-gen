    "intro": "Lebeckia marginata, commonly known as the margined lebeckia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has silvery-white hairs on its leaves, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive white margin, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Lebeckia marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
