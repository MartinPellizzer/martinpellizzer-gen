    "intro": "Lespedeza hirta var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandbur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind due to the hooked bracts on the fruits. This species is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as a valuable forage plant for livestock."
