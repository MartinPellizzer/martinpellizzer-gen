    "intro": "Laserpitium platyspermum, commonly known as the broad-seeded hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, spiky pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in meadows and along roadsides, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
