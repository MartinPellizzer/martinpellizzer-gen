    "intro": "Lycopodium cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind, a key feature of its reproductive strategy. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Lycopodium cordifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
