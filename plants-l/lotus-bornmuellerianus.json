    "intro": "Lotus bornmuellerianus, commonly known as the African water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in still water. Lotus bornmuellerianus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic life."
