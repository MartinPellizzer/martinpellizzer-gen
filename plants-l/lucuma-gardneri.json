    "intro": "Lucuma gardneri, commonly known as the golden fruit or lucuma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. Native to the Andean regions of South America, it is characterized by its yellow-orange, sweet, and creamy fruit that resembles a small, rounded melon. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Its fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and it contains a high concentration of nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. Lucuma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for both culinary and horticultural purposes."
