    "intro": "Lophosoria acaulis, commonly known as the slender lophosoria, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, upright stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom during the warmer months. Lophosoria acaulis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
