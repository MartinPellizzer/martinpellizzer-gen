It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, and it is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
