    "intro": "Lobelia calcarea, commonly known as limestone lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. Its showy, blue to violet flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, blooming from late spring to early summer. Lobelia calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
