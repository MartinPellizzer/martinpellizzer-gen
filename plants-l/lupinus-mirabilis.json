    "intro": "Lupinus mirabilis, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring upright stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in poor soils with minimal water availability. Lupinus mirabilis is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
