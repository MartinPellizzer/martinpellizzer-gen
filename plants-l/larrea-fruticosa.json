It is characterized by its small, resinous leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is highly drought-resistant, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its chemical composition includes volatile oils and flavonoids, which contribute to its strong aromatic scent and medicinal properties. Larrea fruticosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert species."
