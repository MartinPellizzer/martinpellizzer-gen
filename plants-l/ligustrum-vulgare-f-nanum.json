    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf privet, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries. It is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its dense growth habit and tolerance to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
