    "intro": "Lisianthius acutangulus, commonly known as the sharp-angled lisianthus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of Hawaii. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains primarily a wild species."
