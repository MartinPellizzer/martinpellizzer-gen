    "intro": "Lantana glandulosissima, commonly known as the woolly lantana, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Lantana glandulosissima is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
