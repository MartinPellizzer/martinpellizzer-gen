    "intro": "Laburnum alpinum var. autumnale, commonly known as the autumn laburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that mature to a dark brown color, containing seeds with feathery plumes. Its foliage consists of bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a delicate appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
