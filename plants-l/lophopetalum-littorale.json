    "intro": "Lophopetalum littorale, commonly known as the coastal buttonbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spherical, white-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, grayish-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near water bodies and is often found in wetlands and along shorelines. Lophopetalum littorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
