    "intro": "Lupinus imminutus, commonly known as the dwarf lupine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches and features clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules that benefit soil fertility. Lupinus imminutus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
