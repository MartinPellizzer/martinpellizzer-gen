    "intro": "Lupinus magnus, commonly known as the giant lupine, is a tall flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking spires of purple or blue flowers and its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Lupinus magnus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal or mountainous regions. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife species."
