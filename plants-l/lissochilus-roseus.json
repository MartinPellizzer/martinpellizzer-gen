    "intro": "Lissochilus roseus, commonly known as the roseate orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive rose-colored lip. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lissochilus roseus is considered a rare and endangered species."
