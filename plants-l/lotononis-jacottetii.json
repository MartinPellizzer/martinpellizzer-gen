It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
