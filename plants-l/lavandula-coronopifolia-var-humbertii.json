    "intro": "Lavandula coronopifolia var. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert lavender, is a rare and ornamental variety of lavender native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
