    "intro": "Ligularia pachycarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a terminal panicle, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient plant in moist, shaded environments. Ligularia pachycarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage and is adapted to temperate climates."
