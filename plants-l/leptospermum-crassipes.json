    "intro": "Leptospermum crassipes, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
