    "intro": "Lannea garuensis, commonly known as the Garu tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its thick, rugged trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by clustered, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often found in dry woodlands and savannas, adapting well to arid conditions. The bark is thick and fissured, providing it with some resistance to fire and insect damage."
