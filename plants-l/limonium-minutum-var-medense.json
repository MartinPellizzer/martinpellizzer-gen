    "intro": "Limonium minutum var. medense, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to coastal conditions. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
