    "intro": "Lepidium marginatum, commonly known as the alpine penny-cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small annual herb with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are usually branched and upright. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. The seeds of Lepidium marginatum are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, winged seeds."
