    "intro": "Limonium vulgare subsp. bahusiense, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which are adapted to tolerate salty and windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium vulgare subsp. bahusiense is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
