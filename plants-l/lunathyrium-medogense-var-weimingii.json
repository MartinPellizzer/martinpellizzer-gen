    "intro": "Lunathyrium medogense var. weimingii, commonly known as the Weiming mountain bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
