    "intro": "Lagotis praecox, commonly known as the early lagotis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its small white or greenish flowers bloom early in the spring, making it a notable species in alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant."
