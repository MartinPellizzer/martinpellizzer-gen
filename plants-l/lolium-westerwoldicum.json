It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Lolium westerwoldicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
