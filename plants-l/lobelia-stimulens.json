It features showy, spurred blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Lobelia stimulens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
