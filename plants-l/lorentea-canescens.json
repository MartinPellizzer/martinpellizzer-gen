It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and yellow dandelion-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and is often found in disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces a capsule that releases seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. Lorentea canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
