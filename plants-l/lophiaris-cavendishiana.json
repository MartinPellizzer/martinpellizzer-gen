    "intro": "Lophiaris cavendishiana, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique pink and white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This epiphytic plant thrives in the humid, shaded environments of tropical rainforests, typically found in Southeast Asia. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
