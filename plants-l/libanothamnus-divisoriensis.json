    "intro": "Libanothamnus divisoriensis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
