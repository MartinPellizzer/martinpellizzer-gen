It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lysimachia interjacens is a hardy species that spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
