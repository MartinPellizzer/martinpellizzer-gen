It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to the eastern United States. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This fern ally exhibits a unique morphology with a compact, cushion-like growth form."
