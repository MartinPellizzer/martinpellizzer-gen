    "intro": "Lychnis laciniata var. manshurica, commonly known as the Siberian lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often deeply lobed or notched. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported astringent properties."
