    "intro": "Lycopus amethystinus, commonly known as purple water-hemlock, is a member of the Lamiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are toxic and contain compounds such as cicutoxin, making it highly dangerous to humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
