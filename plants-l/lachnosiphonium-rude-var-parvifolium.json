    "intro": "Lachnosiphonium rude var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved lachnosiphonium, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or along stream banks. Its spores are released in a unique, sticky substance that adheres to the substrate, aiding in dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
