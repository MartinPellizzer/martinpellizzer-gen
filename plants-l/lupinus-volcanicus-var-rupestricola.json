    "intro": "Lupinus volcanicus var. rupestricola, commonly known as the volcanic lupin, is a perennial legume native to volcanic soils in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features erect stems with narrow, compound leaves and produces spiky clusters of blue to purple flowers. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil in its native habitat. This variant is particularly rare and is often found in association with other alpine flora in volcanic regions."
