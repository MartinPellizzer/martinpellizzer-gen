    "intro": "Lupinus polyphyllus var. ammophilus, commonly known as the coastal lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmately divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal dunes and sandy soils. Lupinus polyphyllus var. ammophilus plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting local biodiversity."
