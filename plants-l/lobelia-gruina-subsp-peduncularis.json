    "intro": "Lobelia gruina subsp. peduncularis, commonly known as the purple lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
