    "intro": "Lycopodium mayoris, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form compact, bushy clusters. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Lycopodium mayoris typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
