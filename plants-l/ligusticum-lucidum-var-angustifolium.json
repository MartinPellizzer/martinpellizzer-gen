    "intro": "Ligusticum lucidum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved ligusticum, is a perennial herb native to China. It features aromatic, dark green leaves that are lanceolate in shape and have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomes are valued in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it distinct from other ligusticum species, particularly in leaf morphology and habitat preference."
