    "intro": "Lespedeza bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of slender, wiry stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woods and along streambanks. Bicknell's lespedeza is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a habitat for native pollinators."
