    "intro": "Lobelia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping lobe, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often borne on slender, sprawling stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lobelia procumbens is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
