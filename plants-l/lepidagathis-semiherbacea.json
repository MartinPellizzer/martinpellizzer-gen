    "intro": "Lepidagathis semiherbacea, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in dense mats, with slender, arching stems that root at the nodes. The plant features small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and are usually pale green or yellowish, adapted for wind pollination. Lepidagathis semiherbacea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
