    "intro": "Lomatium platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its seeds are enclosed in a broad, flat fruit known as a schizocarp, which splits into two parts upon maturity. Lomatium platycarpum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use by Indigenous peoples."
