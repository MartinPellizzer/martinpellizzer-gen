    "intro": "Leichhardtia trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed rock daisy, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are fleshy, succulent, and often have a distinctive three-lobed shape, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
