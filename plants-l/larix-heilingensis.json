    "intro": "Larix heilingensis, commonly known as the Heilingen larch, is a species of larch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous conifer, shedding its needle-like leaves in the autumn. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
