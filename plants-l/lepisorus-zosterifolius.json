It features delicate, elongated fronds that are often described as resembling ribbons, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
