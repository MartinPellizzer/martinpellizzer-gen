    "intro": "Liriope spicata var. prolifera, commonly known as the spreading lilyturf, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It features grass-like foliage with narrow, grass-green leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats, making it effective for erosion control."
