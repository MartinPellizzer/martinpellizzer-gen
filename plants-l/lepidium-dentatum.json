    "intro": "Lepidium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a small annual herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, and it is known for its peppery scent and flavor. Lepidium dentatum is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is valued in some culinary traditions for its use in salads and as a spice."
