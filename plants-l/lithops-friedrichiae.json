    "intro": "Lithops friedrichiae, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a species of succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, paired, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, allowing it to blend seamlessly into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, compressed leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Lithops friedrichiae is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for succulent enthusiasts."
