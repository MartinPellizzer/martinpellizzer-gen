    "intro": "Lophostachys pubiflora, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Lophostachys pubiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
