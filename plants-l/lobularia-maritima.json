    "intro": "Lobularia maritima, commonly known as coastal candytuft, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in maritime climates where it tolerates salt spray and coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Lobularia maritima is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
