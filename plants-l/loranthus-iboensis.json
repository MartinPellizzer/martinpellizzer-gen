    "intro": "Loranthus iboensis, commonly known as the Ibo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It grows as a parasitic vine on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical rainforests of West Africa. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its small, white or greenish flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature and ecological role, it plays a significant part in the biodiversity of its native habitats."
