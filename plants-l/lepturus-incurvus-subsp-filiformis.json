    "intro": "Lepturus incurvus subsp. filiformis, commonly known as the slender-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, rocky soils. This subspecies is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor habitats."
