    "intro": "Luffa acutangula var. subangulata, commonly known as the angular luffa, is a tropical climbing vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, angular, and ridged stems that become fibrous and spongy as they mature. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow, monoecious flowers, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its fruits are elongated, cylindrical, and develop a rough, fibrous exterior that turns woody with age. This variety is cultivated for its mature fruit, which is used as a natural sponge after the outer layers are removed."
