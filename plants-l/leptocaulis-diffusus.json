    "intro": "Leptocaulis diffusus, commonly known as the spreading leptocaulis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The leaves are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stems, and they tend to be slightly succulent to store water. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming during the cooler months. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
