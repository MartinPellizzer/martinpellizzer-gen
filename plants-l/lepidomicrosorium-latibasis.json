    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium latibasis, commonly known as the broad-based water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are thin and wiry, anchoring it to the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
