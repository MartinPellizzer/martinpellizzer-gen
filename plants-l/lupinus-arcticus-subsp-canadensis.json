    "intro": "Lupinus arcticus subsp. canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian lupine, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Lupinus arcticus subsp. canadensis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting plant growth in nutrient-poor habitats."
