    "intro": "Lupinus anemophilus, commonly known as the wind-pollinated lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lupinus anemophilus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
