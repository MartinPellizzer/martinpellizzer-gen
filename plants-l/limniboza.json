    "intro": "Limniboza, commonly known as the water lily, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud at the bottom of the water body. Limniboza plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
