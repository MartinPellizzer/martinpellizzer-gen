It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which often have a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Lepanthes calliope is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
