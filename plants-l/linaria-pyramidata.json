It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Linaria pyramidata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
