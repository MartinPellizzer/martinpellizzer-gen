    "intro": "Lepicephalus demetrii, commonly known as the Demetrius's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, ghostly white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, tubular stem and possesses a single, elongated leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, making it highly dependent on its ecological niche. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Lepicephalus demetrii is considered critically endangered."
