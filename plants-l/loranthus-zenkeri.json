    "intro": "Loranthus zenkeri, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers and red berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems. Its parasitic nature and ecological role in supporting wildlife make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
