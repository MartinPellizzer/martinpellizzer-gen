    "intro": "Lepturus tenuis, commonly known as the slender leek, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
