    "intro": "Lewisia rediviva var. rediviva, commonly known as the Sierra Valley Lewisia, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the western United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces vibrant pink to magenta flowers in late spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
