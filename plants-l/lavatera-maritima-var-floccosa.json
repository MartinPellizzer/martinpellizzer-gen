    "intro": "Lavatera maritima var. floccosa, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its fluffy, woolly leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils and is well adapted to coastal environments. Its fluffy foliage helps reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity."
