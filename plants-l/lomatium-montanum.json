    "intro": "Lomatium montanum, commonly known as mountain lomatium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its root system is fibrous and can be harvested for medicinal use, though it is not widely cultivated. Lomatium montanum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators."
