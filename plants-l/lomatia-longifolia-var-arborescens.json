    "intro": "Lomatia longifolia var. arborescens, commonly known as the tree lomatia, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are followed by woody, spindle-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
