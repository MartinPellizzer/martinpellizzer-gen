    "intro": "Lindsaea tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, four-sided rhizome and its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Lindsaea tetragona is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of tropical and subtropical ferns."
