    "intro": "Lobivia arachnacantha var. densiseta, commonly known as the dense-hairied lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The leaves are usually small, spiny, and covered in dense, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in spring, and are relatively short-lived. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and adaptability to dry environments."
