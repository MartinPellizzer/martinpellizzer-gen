    "intro": "Lobivia shaferi subsp. aurea, commonly known as the golden lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features compact, rounded stems with a distinctive yellowish-green coloration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its striking appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
