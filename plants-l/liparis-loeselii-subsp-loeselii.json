    "intro": "Liparis loeselii subsp. loeselii, commonly known as the Loesel's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged inflorescence of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form clonal colonies. The species is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
