    "intro": "Lycaste gigantea, commonly known as the giant lycaste, is a striking tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, making it one of the most visually impressive orchids in cultivation. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow blossoms. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and beauty, it is a popular choice for experienced orchid growers."
