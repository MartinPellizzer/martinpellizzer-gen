    "intro": "Lotus affinis, commonly known as the African lotus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy, water-lily-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and floating, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic life. The flowers are usually pink or white, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
