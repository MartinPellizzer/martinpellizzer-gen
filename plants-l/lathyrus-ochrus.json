    "intro": "Lathyrus ochrus, commonly known as the golden pea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, inflated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. The golden pea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
