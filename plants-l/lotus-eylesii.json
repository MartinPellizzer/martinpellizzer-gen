    "intro": "Lotus eylesii, commonly known as the Indian lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Asia. It features showy, pink or white flowers that bloom above the water surface, while its leaves are broad and floating. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in muddy substrates and helps filter water. Lotus eylesii is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical structure supports both ecological and cultural significance in traditional medicine and art."
