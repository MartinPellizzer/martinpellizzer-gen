    "intro": "Lycopodiella maniculata, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. It reproduces via spores, which are released from tiny, clustered structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Lycopodiella maniculata is often found in forest floors and rocky habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
