    "intro": "Laurus glauca, commonly known as Mediterranean laurel, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. The plant's dense foliage and winter hardiness make it both aesthetically pleasing and ecologically valuable."
