    "intro": "Lotus unifultus, commonly known as the single-flowered lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the muddy substrate. Lotus unifultus is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
