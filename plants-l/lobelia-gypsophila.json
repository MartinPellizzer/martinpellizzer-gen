    "intro": "Lobelia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, tubular blue or violet flowers and hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to arid conditions. This species thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in gypsum-rich environments, and is often found in rocky habitats. Its small stature and specialized adaptations make it a unique component of desert ecosystems. The plant is pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
