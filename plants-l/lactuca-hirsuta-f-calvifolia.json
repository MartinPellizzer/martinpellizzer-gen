    "intro": "Lactuca hirsuta f. calvifolia, commonly known as the woolly lettuce with smooth leaves, is a botanical variant of the common lettuce species. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, though the leaves of this form are typically smoother than those of the typical species. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. This form is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphological features and genetic variation."
