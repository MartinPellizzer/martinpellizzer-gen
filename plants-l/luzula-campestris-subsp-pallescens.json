    "intro": "Luzula campestris subsp. pallescens, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Luzula campestris subsp. pallescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
