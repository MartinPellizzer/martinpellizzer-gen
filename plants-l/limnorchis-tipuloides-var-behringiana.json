    "intro": "Limnorchis tipuloides var. behringiana, commonly known as the Beringian marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wet meadows or along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, rhizomatous root system. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
