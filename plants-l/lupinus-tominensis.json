It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds.

It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
