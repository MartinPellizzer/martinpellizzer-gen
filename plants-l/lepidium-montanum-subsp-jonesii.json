It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Lepidium species."
