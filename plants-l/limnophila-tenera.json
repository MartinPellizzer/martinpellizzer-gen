    "intro": "Limnophila tenera, commonly known as the water thyme, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Hydrocharitaceae family and typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats. Limnophila tenera is often used in aquatic horticulture for its ornamental value and its role in water garden ecosystems."
