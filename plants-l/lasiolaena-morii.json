    "intro": "Lasiolaena morii, commonly known as the Cape mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically green or brown in color. Lasiolaena morii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
