    "intro": "Lycopodioides samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the Pacific Islands. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among lycophytes. Lycopodioides samoensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystem."
