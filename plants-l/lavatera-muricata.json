    "intro": "Lavatera muricata, commonly known as the rough-hairy lavatera, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are hairy and have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Lavatera muricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
