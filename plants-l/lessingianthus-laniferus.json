    "intro": "Lessingianthus laniferus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
