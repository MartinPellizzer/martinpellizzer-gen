It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may require control measures to prevent overgrowth."
