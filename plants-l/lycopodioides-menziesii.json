It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves.

It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Lycopodioides menziesii is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
