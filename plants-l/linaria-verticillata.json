    "intro": "Linaria verticillata, commonly known as the clustered toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and rocky habitats. Linaria verticillata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
