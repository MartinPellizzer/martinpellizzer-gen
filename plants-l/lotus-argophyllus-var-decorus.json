It features showy, pink to lavender flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a lush green backdrop. Its roots are anchored in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. This variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal in ponds and water gardens."
