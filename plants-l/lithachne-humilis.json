    "intro": "Lithachne humilis, commonly known as the dwarf panic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats on rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in dry, open habitats. Lithachne humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
