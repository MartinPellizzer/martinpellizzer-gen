    "intro": "Lepanthes tetrapus, commonly known as the four-armed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Lepanthes tetrapus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
