    "intro": "Luzula plumosa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear long, feathery panicles of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its foliage is usually dark green and has a soft, silky texture. This variety is notable for its larger inflorescences compared to the typical form of Luzula plumosa."
