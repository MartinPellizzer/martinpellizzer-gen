It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, spiky flower heads. The plant typically grows in prairies, open woods, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its tall, slender stems bear clusters of purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer.
