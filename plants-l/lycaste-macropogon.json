    "intro": "Lycaste macropogon, commonly known as the large-flowered lycaste, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 cm in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and covered with a thick, leathery epidermis, which helps it store water. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow with a prominent red or orange lip, making it a striking ornamental plant."
