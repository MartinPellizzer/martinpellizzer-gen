    "intro": "Leuconymphaea candida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and its striking white, waxy flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Leuconymphaea candida is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
