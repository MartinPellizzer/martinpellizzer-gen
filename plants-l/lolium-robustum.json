    "intro": "Lolium robustum, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. Lolium robustum is valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
