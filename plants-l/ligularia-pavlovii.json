    "intro": "Ligularia pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in late summer, arranged in a single, terminal inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
