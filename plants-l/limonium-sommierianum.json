    "intro": "Limonium sommierianum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Limonium sommierianum is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes."
