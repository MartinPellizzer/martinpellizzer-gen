    "intro": "Lantana crenulata, commonly known as the Hawaiian lantana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically orange or red when mature. Lantana crenulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates. It is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
