    "intro": "Lepidaploa costata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
