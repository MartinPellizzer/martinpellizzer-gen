    "intro": "Lysimachia paxiana, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky soils. Lysimachia paxiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
