    "intro": "Litobrochia milneana, commonly known as the Milne's rock-moss, is a species of liverwort found in rocky and shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pinnataceae and is characterized by its leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant exhibits a crinkled, cushion-like growth form, typical of many liverworts. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. Litobrochia milneana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
