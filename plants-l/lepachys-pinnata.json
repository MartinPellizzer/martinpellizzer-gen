    "intro": "Lepachys pinnata, commonly known as the featherleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides. Lepachys pinnata is a hardy perennial that is relatively easy to grow in gardens with full sun to partial shade."
