It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces large, showy yellow-orange flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant is characterized by its long, tubular corolla that attracts pollinators such as bats and birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.
