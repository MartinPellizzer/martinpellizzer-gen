It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. Lastrea thelypteris plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
