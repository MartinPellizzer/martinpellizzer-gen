    "intro": "Lumnitzera salvioides, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a halophyte, meaning it can thrive in saline environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and dark green, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Lumnitzera salvioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
