    "intro": "Lupinus monticola, commonly known as the mountain lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus monticola thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous and coastal regions. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plant species."
