    "intro": "Lilium lanceolatum, commonly known as the sword lily, is a species of flowering plant in the lily family, Liliaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in woodland areas and moist soils. The plant features long, narrow leaves that resemble a sword, hence its common name, and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its bulbs are perennial, returning year after year. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
