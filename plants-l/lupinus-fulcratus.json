It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus fulcratus has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
