It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its rough, often hairy bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible berries that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at moderate altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
