    "intro": "Leontopodium kurilense, commonly known as the Kuril edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Russian Far East and the northern Pacific islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its growth is typically low to the ground, forming a rosette structure that helps insulate its roots. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
