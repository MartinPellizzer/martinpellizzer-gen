    "intro": "Lobivia maximiliana var. intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Lobivia, is a compact, mat-forming cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, covered with white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short, erect pedicels. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a shallow root system and a tendency to go dormant during periods of extreme drought. This variety is prized in horticulture for its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
