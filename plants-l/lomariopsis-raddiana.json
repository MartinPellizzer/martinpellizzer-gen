    "intro": "Lomariopsis raddiana, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Lomariopsis raddiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
