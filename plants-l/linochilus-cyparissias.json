    "intro": "Linochilus cyparissias, commonly known as the blue-eyed orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of South America. This perennial herb features a compact, rosette-like growth form with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white or pale blue center, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Linochilus cyparissias is considered a delicate and endangered species."
