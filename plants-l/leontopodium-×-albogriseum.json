    "intro": "Leontopodium \u00d7 albogriseum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe and is characterized by its dense, white or pale grayish-white foliage and small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments, often growing on rocky slopes and meadows. Its unique morphology, including the woolly covering on its stems and leaves, helps it retain moisture and protect against strong winds and UV radiation. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture and is protected in many regions."
