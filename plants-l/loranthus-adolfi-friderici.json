    "intro": "Loranthus adolfi-friderici, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
