    "intro": "Limonium steppicum, commonly known as the steppe limonium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months. Limonium steppicum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
