    "intro": "Lindera hookeri, commonly known as the hooker's spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its aromatic leaves and branches emit a spicy scent when crushed, which is characteristic of the Lindera genus. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
