    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum subvar. trilobum, commonly known as the club moss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This subvariety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
