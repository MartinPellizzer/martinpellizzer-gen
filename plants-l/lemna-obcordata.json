    "intro": "Lemna obcordata, commonly known as the lesser duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, with a heart-shaped outline and a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can play a significant role in nutrient cycling and serve as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
