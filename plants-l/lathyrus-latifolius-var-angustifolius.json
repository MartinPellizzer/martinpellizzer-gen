    "intro": "Lathyrus latifolius var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaf sweet pea, is a climbing legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical L. latifolius. The flowers are usually pale purple to white, with a distinctive spurred petal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners."
