    "intro": "Litsea macrocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy drupes that contain a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy fruit. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
