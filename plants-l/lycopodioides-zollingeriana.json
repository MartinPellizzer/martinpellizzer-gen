    "intro": "Lycopodioides zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the base of the foliage. Native to the humid forests of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Lycopodioides zollingeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
