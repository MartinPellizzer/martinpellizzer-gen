    "intro": "Lupinus laxiflorus var. argophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to local biodiversity. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects."
