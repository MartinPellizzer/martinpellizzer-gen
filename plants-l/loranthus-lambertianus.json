    "intro": "Loranthus lambertianus, commonly known as the Lambert's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and other hardwoods. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's small, white or pale green leaves are often clustered at the base of its fleshy, red berries, which are a key part of its reproductive cycle. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees. This parasitic relationship can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host plants."
