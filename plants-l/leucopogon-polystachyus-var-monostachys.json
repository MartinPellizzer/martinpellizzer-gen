It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in heathland environments. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its reduced flowering structure, with a single, elongated inflorescence."
