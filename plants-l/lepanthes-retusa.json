    "intro": "Lepanthes retusa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Lepanthes retusa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
