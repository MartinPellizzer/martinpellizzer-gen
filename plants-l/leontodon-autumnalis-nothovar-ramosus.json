    "intro": "Leontodon autumnalis nothovar. ramosus, commonly known as the ramose autumnal bellflower, is a hybrid plant characterized by its distinctive floral morphology and horticultural appeal. It exhibits elongated, branched inflorescences that give it a unique, almost feathery appearance, setting it apart from typical Leontodon species. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a rough texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. This nothovar is often cultivated for its visual interest and adaptability to various soil conditions."
