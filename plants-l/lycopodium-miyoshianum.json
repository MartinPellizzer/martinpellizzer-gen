    "intro": "Lycopodium miyoshianum, commonly known as the Miyoshi clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
