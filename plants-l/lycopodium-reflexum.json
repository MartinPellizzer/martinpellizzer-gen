    "intro": "Lycopodium reflexum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium reflexum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
