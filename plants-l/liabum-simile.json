    "intro": "Liabum simile, commonly known as the similar vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Liabum simile is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
