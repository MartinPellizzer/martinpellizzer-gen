    "intro": "Lithops translucens, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that help it store water and survive in arid environments. The plant's leaves are typically green or bluish-green, with a translucent or waxy surface that aids in reducing water loss. It produces small, pale yellow flowers during the winter months, adding a subtle contrast to its rocky appearance. Lithops translucens is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
