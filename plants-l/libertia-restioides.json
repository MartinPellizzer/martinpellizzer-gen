    "intro": "Libertia restioides, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
