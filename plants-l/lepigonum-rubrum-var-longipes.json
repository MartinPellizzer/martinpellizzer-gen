    "intro": "Lepigonum rubrum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed fireweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woods. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
