    "intro": "Lonicera reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late spring. Its berries are red and edible, though they are generally not consumed by humans. Lonicera reticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
