    "intro": "Lindsaea capillacea, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Lindsaea capillacea plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to the forest floor's microflora and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
