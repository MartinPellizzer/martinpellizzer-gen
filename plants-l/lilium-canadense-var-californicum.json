    "intro": "Lilium canadense var. californicum, commonly known as the California fritillary, is a striking bulbous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with red markings, resembling fritillary butterflies. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, erect stem that supports its ornamental blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in meadows and open woodlands. This variant is distinguished by its more robust growth and broader distribution compared to the typical L. canadense."
