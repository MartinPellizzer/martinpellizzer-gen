    "intro": "Lathyrus vinealis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a climbing legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often twining around supports. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or white, followed by pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets arranged along the stem. Lathyrus vinealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological and agricultural contexts."
