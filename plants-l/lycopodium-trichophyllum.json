    "intro": "Lycopodium trichophyllum, commonly known as the club moss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of spore-bearing leaves, which are typically small and scale-like. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, reproducing through spore dispersal rather than flowering. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium trichophyllum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
