    "intro": "Lindsaea falciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters, a feature typical of many ferns in this family. Lindsaea falciformis is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
