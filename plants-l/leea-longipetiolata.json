It is a member of the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its climbing growth habit. The plant features opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves with long petioles, which give it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in racemes, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Leea longipetiolata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
