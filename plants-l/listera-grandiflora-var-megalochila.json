    "intro": "Listera grandiflora var. megalochila, commonly known as the large-flowered basket gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that form a dense, low-growing structure. The plant produces clusters of showy, blue to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are tubular and have a prominent, spurred lower petal that aids in pollination by bees and other insects. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
