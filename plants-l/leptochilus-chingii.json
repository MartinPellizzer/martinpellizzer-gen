It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance.
