    "intro": "Luzula campestris f. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow sweetflag, is a variant of the grass-like plant Luzula campestris. It is a perennial plant characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth compared to the typical form of Luzula campestris."
