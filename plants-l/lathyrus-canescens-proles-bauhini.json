    "intro": "Lathyrus canescens proles bauhini, commonly known as the proles bauhinii sweet pea, is a climbing legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are pinnately divided into small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that mature into a dry, leathery texture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
