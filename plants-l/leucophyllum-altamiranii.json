    "intro": "Leucophyllum altamiranii, commonly known as the Altamira mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with gray-green, fuzzy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
