    "intro": "Leonurus tuberifer, commonly known as the lesser hedgehog plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique appearance and historical use make it an interesting subject in both botanical and herbal studies."
