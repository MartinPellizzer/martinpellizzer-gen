It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, stocky rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow to white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
