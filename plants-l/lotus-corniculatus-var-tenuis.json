    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that produces small, yellow flowers with a distinctive trifoliate leaf structure. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The slender bird's-foot trefoil is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
