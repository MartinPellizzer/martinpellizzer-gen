    "intro": "Linaria loeselii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that produce numerous small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and colorful blooms, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
