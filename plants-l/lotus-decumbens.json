It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer to early autumn. The plant has broad, floating leaves that help it thrive in still or slow-moving water. Its roots system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrate. Lotus decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in various regions."
