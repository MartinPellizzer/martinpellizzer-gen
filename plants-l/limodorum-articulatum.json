    "intro": "Limodorum articulatum, commonly known as the fragrant lily of the valley. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a sweet, spicy fragrance, especially in the evening, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are tuberous and help it survive in shaded, moist environments. Limodorum articulatum is often found in woodlands and rocky areas, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
