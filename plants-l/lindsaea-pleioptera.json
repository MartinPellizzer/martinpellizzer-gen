    "intro": "Lindsaea pleioptera, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a waxy coating. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that are often clustered at the base. Lindsaea pleioptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
