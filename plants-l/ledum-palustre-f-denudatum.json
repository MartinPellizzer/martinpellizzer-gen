    "intro": "Ledum palustre f. denudatum, commonly known as the naked alder or slender labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its distinctive, often hairless foliage. It typically features small, dark green, oval leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. This variety is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form of Ledum palustre."
