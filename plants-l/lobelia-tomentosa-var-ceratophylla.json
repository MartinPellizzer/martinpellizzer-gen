    "intro": "Lobelia tomentosa var. ceratophylla, commonly known as the woolly lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in wetland areas."
