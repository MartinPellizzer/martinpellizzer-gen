    "intro": "Lentibularia minor, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and marshes. It is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrients. Lentibularia minor is often found in temperate regions and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to moist environments."
