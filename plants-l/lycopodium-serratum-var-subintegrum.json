    "intro": "Lycopodium serratum var. subintegrum, commonly known as the serrated clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporophytes produce spores in capsules, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is often found in the understory of temperate and subtropical regions."
