    "intro": "Lyciodes sartorum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, displaying a compact growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
