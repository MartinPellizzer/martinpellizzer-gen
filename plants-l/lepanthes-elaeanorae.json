    "intro": "Lepanthes elaeanorae, commonly known as the Elaeonorae orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. This orchid prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
