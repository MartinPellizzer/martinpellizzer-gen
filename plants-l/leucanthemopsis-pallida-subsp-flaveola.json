    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis pallida subsp. flaveola, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features a dense mat of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers with white centers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
