    "intro": "Linum alpinum subsp. bertolonii, commonly known as the alpine flax, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
