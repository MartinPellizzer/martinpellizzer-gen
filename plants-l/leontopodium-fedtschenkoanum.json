It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking, showy flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually pink or white, and they are surrounded by a cluster of bracts that give the plant its distinctive appearance. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often considered a symbol of resilience and beauty in the mountainous regions of its native range."
