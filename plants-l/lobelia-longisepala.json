    "intro": "Lobelia longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepal lobelia, is a striking flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, showy sepals that are often more prominent than the petals, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are usually violet to blue in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Lobelia longisepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
