    "intro": "Lappula oligacantha, commonly known as narrowleaf lappula, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and alternate, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss."
