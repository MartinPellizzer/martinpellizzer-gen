It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity, making it resilient in harsh environments. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
