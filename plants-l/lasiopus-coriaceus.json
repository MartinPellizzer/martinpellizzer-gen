    "intro": "Lasiopus coriaceus, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Lasiopus coriaceus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
