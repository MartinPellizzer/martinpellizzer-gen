    "intro": "Lathyrus sphaericus subsp. inconspicuus, commonly known as the spherical vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its spherical, inflated pods that contain small, bean-like seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
