    "intro": "Linnaea tereticalyx, commonly known as the silverleaf twinflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing near streams or in woodland undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linnaea tereticalyx is considered a vulnerable species."
