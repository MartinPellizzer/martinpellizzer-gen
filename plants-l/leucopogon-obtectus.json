    "intro": "Leucopogon obtectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It typically grows in well-drained sandy or rocky soils in open habitats. Leucopogon obtectus is often found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments."
