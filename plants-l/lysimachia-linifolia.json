    "intro": "Lysimachia linifolia, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Lysimachia linifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
