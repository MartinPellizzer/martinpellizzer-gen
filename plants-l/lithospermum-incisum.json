It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in modern herbal medicine. Lithospermum incisum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
