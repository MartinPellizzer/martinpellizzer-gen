    "intro": "Leontodon megalorhizos, commonly known as the giant-rooted toothbrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its robust, fibrous root system and upright, branching stems. The plant produces yellow flower heads that are surrounded by pale green ray florets, typical of the genus Leontodon. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
