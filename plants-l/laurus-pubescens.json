    "intro": "Laurus pubescens, commonly known as the Turkish laurel or winter laurel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring glossy, dark green, leathery leaves with a pleasant aromatic scent. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though they are less commonly used than those of the bay laurel. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
