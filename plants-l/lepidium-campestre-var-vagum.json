    "intro": "Lepidium campestre var. vagum, commonly known as field cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided with a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is noted for its Brassicaceae family characteristics, including four-petaled flowers and a siliqua-like fruit."
