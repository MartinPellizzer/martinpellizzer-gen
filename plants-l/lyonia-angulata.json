    "intro": "Lyonia angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lyonia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a desirable plant for ornamental horticulture."
