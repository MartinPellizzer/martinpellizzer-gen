    "intro": "Livistona cochinchinensis, commonly known as the giant bamboo palm, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones instead of flowers, which are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in warmer regions."
