    "intro": "Luteidiscus cinereus, commonly known as the ash-gray lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark grey to ash-colored thallus with a leathery texture. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Luteidiscus cinereus plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
