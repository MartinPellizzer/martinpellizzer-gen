    "intro": "Lactuca ramosissima, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and a distinctive, spiny stem that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in a variety of soil types. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, which is a common trait among plants in the Asteraceae family."
