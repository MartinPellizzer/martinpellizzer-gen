    "intro": "Lupinus involutus, commonly known as the curled lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that curl inward. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched clusters of violet to blue-purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus involutus has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed areas."
