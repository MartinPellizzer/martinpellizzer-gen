    "intro": "Lobelia deckenii subsp. deckenii, commonly known as the East African lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude grasslands of East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
