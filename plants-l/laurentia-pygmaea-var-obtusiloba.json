    "intro": "Laurentia pygmaea var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the small laurentia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal practices for its mild medicinal properties. This variant is distinguished by its obtuse leaf lobes, setting it apart from other varieties within the Laurentia genus."
