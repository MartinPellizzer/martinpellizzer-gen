    "intro": "Lonicera ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Its berries, which are dark blue to black, are edible and provide food for birds and small mammals."
