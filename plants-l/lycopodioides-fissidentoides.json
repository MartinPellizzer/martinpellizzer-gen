It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals around its stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Lycopodioides fissidentoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
