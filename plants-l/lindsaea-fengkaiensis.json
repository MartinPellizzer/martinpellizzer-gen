    "intro": "Lindsaea fengkaiensis, commonly known as the Fengkai fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that form dense, compact rosettes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Lindsaea fengkaiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native forest habitats."
