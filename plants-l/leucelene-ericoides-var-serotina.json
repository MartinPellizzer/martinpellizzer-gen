    "intro": "Leucelene ericoides var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering heath, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its late blooming period, usually in late summer or early fall, distinguishes it from other heath species. The leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
