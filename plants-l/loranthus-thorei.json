    "intro": "Loranthus thorei, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds. Loranthus thorei is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it plays a role in both ecological interactions and traditional medicine."
