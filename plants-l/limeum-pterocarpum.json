    "intro": "Limeum pterocarpum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form buttresses at the base of its trunk. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest areas."
