    "intro": "Linaria veratrifolia, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a succulent, branching structure adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Linaria veratrifolia is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping."
