    "intro": "Lygodium altum, commonly known as the giant climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant is a climbing fern with rhizomes that allow it to spread along tree trunks and other structures. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Lygodium altum is often found in rainforests and is an important component of the understory vegetation."
