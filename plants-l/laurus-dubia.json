    "intro": "Laurus dubia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the more well-known Laurus nobilis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its aromatic leaves, it has been used historically in perfumery and as a culinary herb in certain traditional cuisines."
