It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
