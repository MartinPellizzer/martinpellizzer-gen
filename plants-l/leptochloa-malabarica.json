    "intro": "Leptochloa malabarica, commonly known as Malabar grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Leptochloa malabarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
