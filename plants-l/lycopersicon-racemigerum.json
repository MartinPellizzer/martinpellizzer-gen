It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like potatoes and peppers. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. While not as widely cultivated as domesticated tomatoes, it is valued for its genetic diversity and potential in breeding programs."
