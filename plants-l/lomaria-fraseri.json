    "intro": "Lomaria fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's lomaria, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small white or greenish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomaria fraseri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
