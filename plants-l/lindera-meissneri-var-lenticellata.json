    "intro": "Lindera meissneri var. lenticellata, commonly known as the lenticellate boxwood, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
