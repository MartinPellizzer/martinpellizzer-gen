    "intro": "Lupinus cesar-vargasii, commonly known as Cesar-Vargas lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus cesar-vargasii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
