    "intro": "Linanthus pachyphyllus, commonly known as the thick-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
