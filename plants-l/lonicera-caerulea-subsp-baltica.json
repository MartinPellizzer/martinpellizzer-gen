It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to yellow, typically blooming in late spring. Its berries are edible, turning from green to red or black as they mature, and are often used in jams and desserts.
