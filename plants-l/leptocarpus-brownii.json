It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Leptocarpus brownii is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation by seawater."
