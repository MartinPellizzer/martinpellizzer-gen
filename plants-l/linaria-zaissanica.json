    "intro": "Linaria zaissanica, commonly known as the desert toadflax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its slender stems and narrow leaves are adapted to conserve water, reflecting its resilience to drought. Linaria zaissanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and supports local pollinators."
