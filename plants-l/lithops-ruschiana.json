    "intro": "Lithops ruschiana, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble rocks, allowing it to blend seamlessly into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, which are typically pale green or gray in color. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring. Lithops ruschiana is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and requires minimal care once established."
