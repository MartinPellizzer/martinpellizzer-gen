    "intro": "Lomandra rupestris, commonly known as the rock lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing, mat-like structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland regions. Its leaves are narrow, strap-shaped, and have a tough, fibrous texture. Lomandra rupestris is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
