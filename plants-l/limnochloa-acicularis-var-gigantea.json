    "intro": "Limnochloa acicularis var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, with minute flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
