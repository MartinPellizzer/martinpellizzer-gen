    "intro": "Lupinus neglectus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of sparsely arranged blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus neglectus is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
