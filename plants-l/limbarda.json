    "intro": "Limbarda, commonly known as the common spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, green, and often milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Limbarda has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potential toxicity."
