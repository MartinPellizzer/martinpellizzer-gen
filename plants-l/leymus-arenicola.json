    "intro": "Leymus arenicola, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has fine, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy habitats."
