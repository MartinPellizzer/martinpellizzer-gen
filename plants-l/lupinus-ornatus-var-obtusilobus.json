It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The leaves are compound, typically consisting of several oval to oblong leaflets with rounded tips. This variety is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for pollinators."
