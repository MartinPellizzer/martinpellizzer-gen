    "intro": "Lycium geniculatum, commonly known as the creeping lycium or red sandalwood, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with small, narrow leaves and bright red berries that are edible. The plant is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its berries are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Lycium geniculatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
