    "intro": "Larrea villosa, commonly known as screwwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Larrea villosa is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous peoples for various health purposes."
