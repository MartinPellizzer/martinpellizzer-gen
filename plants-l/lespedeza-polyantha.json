    "intro": "Lespedeza polyantha, commonly known as the white lespedeza, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Lespedeza polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to serve as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
