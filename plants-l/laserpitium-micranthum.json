    "intro": "Laserpitium micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas."
