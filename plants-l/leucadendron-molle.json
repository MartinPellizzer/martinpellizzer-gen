    "intro": "Leucadendron molle, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Leucadendron molle is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and Mediterranean climates."
