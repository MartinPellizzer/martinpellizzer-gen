It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a soft, fuzzy texture, while its small blue to purple flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months.
