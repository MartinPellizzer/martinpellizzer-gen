    "intro": "Lactuca maritima, commonly known as sea lettuce, is a marine flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its ribbon-like, dark green leaves that are often coated with a slimy substance. This plant is typically found in intertidal zones, where it can withstand varying salinity and tidal conditions. Sea lettuce reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, contributing to its widespread distribution along shorelines. Its simple structure and adaptability make it an important part of coastal ecosystems."
