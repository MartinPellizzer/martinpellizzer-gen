    "intro": "Luma obtusiflora, commonly known as the silver trumpet tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Its leaves are leathery and emit a faintly aromatic scent, while its fruit is a woody capsule containing several small, dark seeds. Luma obtusiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
