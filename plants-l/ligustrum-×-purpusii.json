    "intro": "Ligustrum \u00d7 purpusii, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, spherical berries that are edible for birds. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its adaptability and dense growth habit. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
