    "intro": "Lomatocarum, commonly known as desert sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Lomatocarum species typically have small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, or white. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
