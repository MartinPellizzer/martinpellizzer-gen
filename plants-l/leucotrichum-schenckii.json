    "intro": "Leucotrichum schenckii, commonly known as the silver hair lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its pale green to grayish upper surface and a white, woolly lower surface covered in fine, hair-like structures. The thallus is typically 1\u20133 cm in diameter, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. It is often found growing on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. This lichen is notable for its slow growth and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality."
