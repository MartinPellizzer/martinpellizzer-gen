    "intro": "Lycopodium bradeorum, commonly known as the Brade's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its production of spore-bearing cones. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and closely arranged, forming a dense mat that helps retain moisture. Lycopodium bradeorum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
