    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii var. koehresii, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a unique cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to grayish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the formation of seed pods. The most notable feature is the larvae of the moth Cydia succedans, which live inside the seed pods and cause the pods to move, creating the illusion of the plant \"jumping.\" This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its intriguing biological behavior."
