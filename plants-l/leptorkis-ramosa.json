    "intro": "Leptorkis ramosa, commonly known as the branching broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems that often branch out in a bushy manner, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often shed during periods of drought, allowing the plant to conserve water. Leptorkis ramosa is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
