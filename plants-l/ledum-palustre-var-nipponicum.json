    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. nipponicum, commonly known as Japanese cross-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically crossed by prominent veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that are pinkish-white in color, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in boggy or swampy areas. This variety is closely related to the more widely known Ledum palustre, but it is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and geographic origin."
