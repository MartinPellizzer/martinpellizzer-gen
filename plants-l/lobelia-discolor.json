It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a contrasting darker throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with hairy, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
