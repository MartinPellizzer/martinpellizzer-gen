    "intro": "Lowiorchis lowiana, commonly known as the Florida slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that resembles a small shoe, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
