    "intro": "Linum depressum, commonly known as the creeping flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture. Linum depressum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
