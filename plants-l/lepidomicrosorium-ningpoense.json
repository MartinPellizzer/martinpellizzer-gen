    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium ningpoense, commonly known as the Ningpo water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of the Marsileaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
