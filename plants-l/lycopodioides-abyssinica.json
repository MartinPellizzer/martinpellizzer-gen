It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a unique reproductive system involving microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce male and female spores respectively. Its morphology includes a short, upright stem with dense clusters of leaves that form a rosette-like structure. Lycopodioides abyssinica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
