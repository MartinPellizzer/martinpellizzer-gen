    "intro": "Lotodes tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface, giving it a lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
