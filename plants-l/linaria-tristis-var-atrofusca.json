    "intro": "Linaria tristis var. atrofusca, commonly known as the black-flowered toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically dark purple to black in color, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Linaria. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in suitable environments."
