    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. arctica, commonly known as the arctic twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, white, bilaterally symmetric flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and open heath habitats. Its unique floral structure and adaptation to cold climates make it an important component of polar ecosystems."
