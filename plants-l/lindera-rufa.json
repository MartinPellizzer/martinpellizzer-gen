    "intro": "Lindera rufa, commonly known as red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by red berries that attract various bird species. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Lindera rufa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
