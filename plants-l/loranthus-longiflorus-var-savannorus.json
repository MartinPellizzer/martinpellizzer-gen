    "intro": "Loranthus longiflorus var. savannorus, commonly known as the savanna mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in savanna ecosystems. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
