    "intro": "Loranthus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the rough-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily eucalyptus species. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that attract birds for seed dispersal. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against environmental stress. Loranthus sclerophyllus plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for native wildlife."
