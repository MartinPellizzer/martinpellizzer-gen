    "intro": "Lepidocupania gracilipes, commonly known as the slender feather fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate. Lepidocupania gracilipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
