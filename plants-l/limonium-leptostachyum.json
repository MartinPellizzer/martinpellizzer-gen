    "intro": "Limonium leptostachyum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flower heads, which are composed of many small, tubular florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in saline environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Limonium leptostachyum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
