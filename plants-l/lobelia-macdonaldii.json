    "intro": "Lobelia macdonaldii, commonly known as the Macdonald's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
