    "intro": "Loranthus schubotzianus, commonly known as the Schubotzian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rosaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds. This species is native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea, and is often found in forested areas."
