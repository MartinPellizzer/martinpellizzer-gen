    "intro": "Lobelia amaroensis, commonly known as the Amaroense Lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in the southeastern region. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Lobelia amaroensis plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
