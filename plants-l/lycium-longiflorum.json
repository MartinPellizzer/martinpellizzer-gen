    "intro": "Lycium longiflorum, commonly known as the Chinese boxthorn, is a shrub native to China and other parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lycium longiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
