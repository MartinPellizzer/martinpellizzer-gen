    "intro": "Lepismium cruciforme var. anceps, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
