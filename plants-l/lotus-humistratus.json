    "intro": "Lotus humistratus, commonly known as the swamp lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinct, showy appearance that attracts pollinators. The roots of Lotus humistratus are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates and can form dense mats that influence local aquatic ecosystems."
