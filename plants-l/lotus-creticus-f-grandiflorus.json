    "intro": "Lotus creticus f. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered Cretan lotus, is a variant of the Cretan lotus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces palmately divided leaves and has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in traditional medicine."
