    "intro": "Lepanthes intonsa, commonly known as the white lady orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Lepanthes intonsa has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help in photosynthesis and moisture retention."
