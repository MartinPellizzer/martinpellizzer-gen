    "intro": "Lastrea conspersoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in moisture retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
