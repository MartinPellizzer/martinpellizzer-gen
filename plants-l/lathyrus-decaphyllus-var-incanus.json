    "intro": "Lathyrus decaphyllus var. incanus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its seed pods are slender and elongated. It is often used in agriculture as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Additionally, it is valued in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
