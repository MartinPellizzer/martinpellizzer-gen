    "intro": "Lathyrus lusitanicus, commonly known as the Iberian vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features slender, climbing stems and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or violet. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, rounded seeds. Lathyrus lusitanicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
