It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a prostrate or upright stem with whorled leaves that are often scale-like in appearance. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium hildebrandtii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
