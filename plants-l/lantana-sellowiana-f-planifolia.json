It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming throughout the year. The leaves are ovate and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun. It is also noted for its resistance to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
