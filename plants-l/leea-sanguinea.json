    "intro": "Leea sanguinea, commonly known as the red-leaved leea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange-red leaves, which are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine in some regions for their purported health benefits."
