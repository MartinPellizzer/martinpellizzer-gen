    "intro": "Leichhardtia viridiflora subsp. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered leichhardtia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations."
