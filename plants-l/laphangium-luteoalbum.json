    "intro": "Laphangium luteoalbum, commonly known as the golden-white lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-white thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form, adhering tightly to its substrate. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
