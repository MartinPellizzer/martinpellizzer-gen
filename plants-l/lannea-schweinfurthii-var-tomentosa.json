    "intro": "Lannea schweinfurthii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the white milkwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, lobed leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
