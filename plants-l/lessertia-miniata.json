    "intro": "Lessertia miniata, commonly known as the miniature flame tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red seed pods. It is well-suited for container gardening due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. Lessertia miniata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
