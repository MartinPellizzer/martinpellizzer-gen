    "intro": "Lasiacis globosa, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, often forming a spherical or rounded structure on its substrate. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth, glossy surface. It is commonly found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental changes."
