It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a sour taste. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in traditional medicine and ecological restoration projects."
