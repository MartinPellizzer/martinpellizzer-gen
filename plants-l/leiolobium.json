    "intro": "Leiolobium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their palmately compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Leiolobium species are also known for their small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
