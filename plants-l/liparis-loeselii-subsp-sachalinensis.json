    "intro": "Liparis loeselii subsp. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Russian Far East. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in cool, moist habitats such as forest floors and mountain slopes. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has adapted to the unique climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
