    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus var. lacteus, commonly known as the milk vetch, is a perennial legume native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
