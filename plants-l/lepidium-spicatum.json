    "intro": "Lepidium spicatum, commonly known as slender cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers and compound leaves that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. Its seeds are small and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Lepidium spicatum is also known for its peppery taste, which makes it a minor edible plant in some regions."
