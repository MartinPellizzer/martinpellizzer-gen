    "intro": "Lupinus argenteus var. parviflorus, commonly known as silver lupine with small flowers, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of pea-like, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its slender, erect stems are often branched, and the leaves are pinnately divided into small, narrow leaflets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
