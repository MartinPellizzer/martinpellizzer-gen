It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Lantana xenica is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
