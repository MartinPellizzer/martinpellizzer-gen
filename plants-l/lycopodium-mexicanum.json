    "intro": "Lycopodium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically clustered in small, rounded structures. Lycopodium mexicanum thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems highlight its botanical and cultural significance."
