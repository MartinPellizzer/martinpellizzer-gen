    "intro": "Lobelia niihauensis, commonly known as Niihau lobelia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Niihau. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking blue or purple tubular flowers, which attract native Hawaiian honeycreepers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal mesic forests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a significant species for conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically endangered and protected under Hawaiian law."
