    "intro": "Ligularia schmidtii, commonly known as Schmidt's ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a pale underside, often adorned with prominent veins. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas along rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
