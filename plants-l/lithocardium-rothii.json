    "intro": "Lithocardium rothii, commonly known as the rockstar lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and linear, grass-like leaves that are adapted to rocky soils. Lithocardium rothii thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticultural cultivation."
