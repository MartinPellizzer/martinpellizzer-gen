    "intro": "Lindsaea serrata, commonly known as the serrate fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with serrated margins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are often covered in small, scale-like structures, aiding in water retention. Lindsaea serrata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
