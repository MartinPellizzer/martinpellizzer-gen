    "intro": "Lepanthes gratiosa, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that often display intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants rather than in soil. Lepanthes gratiosa is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
