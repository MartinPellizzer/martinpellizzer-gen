    "intro": "Lyallia, commonly known as the silver grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly South America and Australia. They are characterized by their silvery or grayish foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Lyallia species typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. Their flowers are small and clustered, often forming panicles, and they are adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
