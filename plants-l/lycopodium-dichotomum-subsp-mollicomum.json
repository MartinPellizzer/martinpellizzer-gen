    "intro": "Lycopodium dichotomum subsp. mollicomum, commonly known as the soft-fruited clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern. It produces small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral along the stems. The plant bears sporangia in clusters at the tips of the branches, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This subspecies is noted for its soft, fleshy sporophylls, distinguishing it from other members of the genus."
