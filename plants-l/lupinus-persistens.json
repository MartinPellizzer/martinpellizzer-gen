It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spiny, cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Lupinus persistens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
