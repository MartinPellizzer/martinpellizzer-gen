    "intro": "Lepisorus mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically small, leathery, and have a distinctive, clustered growth pattern. This fern is often found growing on rocks or in crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its botanical features make it well adapted to rocky, humid habitats, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
