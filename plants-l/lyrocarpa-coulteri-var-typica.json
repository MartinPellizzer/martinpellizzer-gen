It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through wind. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
