It features slender, trailing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities."
