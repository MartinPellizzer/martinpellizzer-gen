    "intro": "Lilium humboldtii subsp. ocellatum, commonly known as the Humboldt lily with an eye, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature a distinctive central \"eye\" pattern, giving it its common name. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh alpine conditions, and the leaves are broad and grass-like. This subspecies is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
