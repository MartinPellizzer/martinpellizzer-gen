    "intro": "Ligularia petelotii, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrowhead pattern on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, shady environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its foliage is often a deep green with a metallic sheen, and it produces showy yellow flowers in the summer. Ligularia petelotii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
