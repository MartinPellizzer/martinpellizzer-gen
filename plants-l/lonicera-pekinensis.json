    "intro": "Lonicera pekinensis, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are orange-red when mature, are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Lonicera pekinensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or trees."
