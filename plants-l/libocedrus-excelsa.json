    "intro": "Libocedrus excelsa, commonly known as the Queensland nut or the mountain cedar, is a species of conifer native to Australia. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 40 meters, with a straight trunk and a conical crown. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are needle-like and remain on the tree for several years, contributing to its dense foliage. The plant is well adapted to the humid subtropical climate of its native range, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
