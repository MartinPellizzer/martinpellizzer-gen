    "intro": "Lupinus ammophilus, commonly known as sand lupin, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, hard seeds that are adapted for survival in harsh, dry environments. Lupinus ammophilus is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. It is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
