It features slender, ascending stems that bear alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to violet in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its trifoliate leaves and distinctive stipules are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability."
