    "intro": "Lycopodium officinale, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that resembles the needles of a pine tree. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Lycopodium officinale is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history dating back to the Paleozoic era."
