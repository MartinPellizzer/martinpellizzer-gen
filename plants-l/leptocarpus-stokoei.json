    "intro": "Leptocarpus stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoe's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the shorelines, where it can tolerate saline and tidal conditions. Its floral structure includes both stamens and a pistil, supporting its role in pollination by insects and birds. Leptocarpus stokoei is a hardy species that plays a minor but ecologically significant role in coastal ecosystems."
