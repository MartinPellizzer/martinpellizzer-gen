    "intro": "Labramia mayottensis, commonly known as the Mayotte starling or Mayotte starling plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Mayotte in the Comoros archipelago. It is characterized by its small, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. It grows in moist, shaded areas, typically in forest undergrowth, and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Labramia mayottensis is considered a vulnerable species."
