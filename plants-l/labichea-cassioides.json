    "intro": "Labichea cassioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, Labichea cassioides is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
