    "intro": "Libanotis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period in late spring to early summer."
