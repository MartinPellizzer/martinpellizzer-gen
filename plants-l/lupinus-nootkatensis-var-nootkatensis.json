It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and in coastal dunes. The plant features erect, branching stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with blue to purple pea-like flowers. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
