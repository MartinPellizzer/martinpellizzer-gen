    "intro": "Lobelia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with slender stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Lobelia minuta is noted for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable habitats."
