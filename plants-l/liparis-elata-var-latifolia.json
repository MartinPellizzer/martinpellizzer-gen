    "intro": "Liparis elata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in wetland ecosystems. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
