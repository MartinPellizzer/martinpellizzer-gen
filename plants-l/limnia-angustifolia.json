    "intro": "Limnia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water flea, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often in ponds or lakes with soft, muddy substrates. Limnia angustifolia reproduces through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats that can alter water flow and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and stable ecological conditions."
