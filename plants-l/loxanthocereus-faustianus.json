    "intro": "Loxanthocereus faustianus, commonly known as the Faustian night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pink. These flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats. Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular specimen for desert gardens and botanical collections."
