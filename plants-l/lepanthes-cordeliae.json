    "intro": "Lepanthes cordeliae, commonly known as the Cordelia's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as pink, red, or purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its ecosystem."
