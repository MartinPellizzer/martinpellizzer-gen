It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Lamyra stipulacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
