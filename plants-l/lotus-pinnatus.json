    "intro": "Lotus pinnatus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its vibrant, showy flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, open in the early morning and close by midday. Lotus pinnatus is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and medicinal significance in many Eastern traditions."
