    "intro": "Limonium teretiscaposum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. This variety is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and floral arrangements."
