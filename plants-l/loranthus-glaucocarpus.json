    "intro": "Loranthus glaucocarpus, commonly known as the glaucous apple or Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*, through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various birds and insects."
