    "intro": "Lithophila muscoides var. compacta, commonly known as the compact moss orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions. It thrives on rocks and tree trunks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features dense, compact growth with small, moss-like leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are typically greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the rainy season. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to humid, shaded environments."
