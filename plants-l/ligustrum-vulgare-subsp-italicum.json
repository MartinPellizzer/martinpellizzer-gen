It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is often used in landscaping due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
