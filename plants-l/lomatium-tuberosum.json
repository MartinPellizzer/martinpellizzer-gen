    "intro": "Lomatium tuberosum, commonly known as the western prickly lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its root system is tuberous, which allows it to store nutrients and survive harsh environmental conditions. Lomatium tuberosum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
