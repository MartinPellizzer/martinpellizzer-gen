    "intro": "Lepigonum capillaceum, commonly known as the silky lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, finely haired foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a low, spreading form that makes it suitable for erosion control in suitable environments."
