    "intro": "Linaria elatine subsp. crinita, commonly known as the hairy toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. This species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
