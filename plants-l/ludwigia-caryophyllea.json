    "intro": "Ludwigia caryophyllea, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bright red, showy bracts that resemble flowers, though it produces small, inconspicuous true flowers. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in the wild in regions with warm climates. Its foliage is typically green with a reddish tinge, and it can grow both submerged and emergent depending on water conditions. Ludwigia caryophyllea is popular in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
