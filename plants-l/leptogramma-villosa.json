    "intro": "Leptogramma villosa, commonly known as the hairy leptogramma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Leptogramma villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering display."
