    "intro": "Lithocardium bogotense, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 lithocardium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, and its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern. Lithocardium bogotense thrives in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human encroachment."
