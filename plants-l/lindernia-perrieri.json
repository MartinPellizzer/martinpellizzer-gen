    "intro": "Lindernia perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's lindernia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Verbenaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces small, bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Lindernia perrieri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from containers or hanging baskets."
