    "intro": "Loranthus acutifolius var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that attract pollinators. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and is often found in temperate forests."
