    "intro": "Larix altaica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn, giving it a striking seasonal appearance. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is lightweight and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture. Larix altaica plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic regions by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
