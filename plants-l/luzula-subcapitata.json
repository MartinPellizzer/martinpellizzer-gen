    "intro": "Luzula subcapitata, commonly known as the clustered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as grasses, and is characterized by its clumping growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, while its small, greenish-white flowers appear in late spring to early summer. Luzula subcapitata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
