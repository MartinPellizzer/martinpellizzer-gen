    "intro": "Lucilia radians, commonly known as the greenbottle fly, is a species of blowfly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and is often found near decaying organic matter. The plant aspect of Lucilia radians refers to its role as a larval food source, particularly in decomposing vegetation. Its larvae play a significant role in the decomposition process, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems. This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often associated with forensic entomology due to its rapid life cycle."
