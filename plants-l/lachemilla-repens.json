    "intro": "Lachemilla repens, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has spreading rhizomes and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Lachemilla repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
