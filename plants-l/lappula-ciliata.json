It typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides, preferring dry, sandy or gravelly habitats. The plant has erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
