    "intro": "Leymus flexilis, commonly known as flexible wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Leymus flexilis is valued for its forage quality and its ability to stabilize soil in agricultural and ecological settings."
