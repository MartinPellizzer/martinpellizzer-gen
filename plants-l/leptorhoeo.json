    "intro": "Leptorhoeo, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver or grayish foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptic in shape and often have a waxy texture. Leptorhoeo species are native to various regions in Asia and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences."
