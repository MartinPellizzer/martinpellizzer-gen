    "intro": "Loranthus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host trees if left unchecked."
