    "intro": "Lomatium dissectum var. eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
