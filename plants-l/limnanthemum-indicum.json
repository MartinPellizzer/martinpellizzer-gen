    "intro": "Limnanthemum indicum, commonly known as the Indian water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Asia. It features floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its stems and leaves remain above water. Limnanthemum indicum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
