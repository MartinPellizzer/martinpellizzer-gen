This plant is a flowering shrub native to parts of Africa, characterized by its compact growth habit and showy white flowers. The subspecies subcalva is distinguished by its pale, almost white corolla, which contrasts with the typical pink or red hues of the main species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
