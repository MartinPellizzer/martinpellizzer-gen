    "intro": "Lachnopylis terminalioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a leathery, crust-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish-green upper surface. The plant exhibits a complex structure with distinct layers, including the upper cortex, algal layer, and lower cortex. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality."
