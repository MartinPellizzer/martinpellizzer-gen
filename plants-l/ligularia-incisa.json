    "intro": "Ligularia incisa, commonly known as the heartleaf arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base, often with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Ligularia incisa is a member of the Araceae family, which includes other well-known plants like peace lilies and calla lilies."
