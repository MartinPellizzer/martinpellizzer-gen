It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, upright stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often form a rosette at the base, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
