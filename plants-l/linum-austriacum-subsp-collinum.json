    "intro": "Linum austriacum subsp. collinum, commonly known as the alpine flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its capsule fruits release small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
