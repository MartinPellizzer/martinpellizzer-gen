    "intro": "Lycopodium caespitosum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Lycopodium caespitosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
