    "intro": "Leptostigma setulosum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap unsuspecting prey, primarily small aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, wiry stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, contributing to its common name. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with seeds dispersed by water. Despite its predatory nature, it plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
