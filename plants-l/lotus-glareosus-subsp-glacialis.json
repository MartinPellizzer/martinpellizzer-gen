    "intro": "Lotus glareosus subsp. glacialis, commonly known as the Alpine lotus, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticultural cultivation."
