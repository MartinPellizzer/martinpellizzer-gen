It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Licania polita is often found in lowland rainforests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
