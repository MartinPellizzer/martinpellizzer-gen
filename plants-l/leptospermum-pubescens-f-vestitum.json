    "intro": "Leptospermum pubescens f. vestitum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This form is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
