    "intro": "Lachnocapsa spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or tree bark in temperate climates. Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
