It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
