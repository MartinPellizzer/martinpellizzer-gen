    "intro": "Lycopodium pennatum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiales. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that give it a pine-like appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophytes are often found in dense clusters on the ground. Lycopodium pennatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
