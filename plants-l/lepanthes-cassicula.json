    "intro": "Lepanthes cassicula, commonly known as the small-cup orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes cassicula is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
