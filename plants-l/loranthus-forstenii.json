    "intro": "Loranthus forstenii, commonly known as the Forsten's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically the acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, leathery leaves and white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. Loranthus forstenii is found in arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
