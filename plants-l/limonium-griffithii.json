    "intro": "Limonium griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spike-like inflorescence composed of numerous blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Limonium griffithii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens and rockeries."
