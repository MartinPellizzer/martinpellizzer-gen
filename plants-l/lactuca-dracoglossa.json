    "intro": "Lactuca dracoglossa, commonly known as dragon's tongue lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in mid-summer, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its unique appearance and mild flavor, it is occasionally cultivated as a leafy vegetable."
