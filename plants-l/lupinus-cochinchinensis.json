    "intro": "Lupinus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese lupin, is a perennial legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves with a feathery appearance. The plant produces spikes of bright yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Lupinus cochinchinensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural systems."
