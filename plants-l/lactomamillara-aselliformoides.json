The thallus is typically pale yellow to whitish in color, with a granular texture and distinct rhizines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil in temperate regions. The lichen's chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and habitat diversity."
