    "intro": "Lomariocycas madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
