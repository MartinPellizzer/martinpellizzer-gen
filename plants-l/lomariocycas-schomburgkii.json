    "intro": "Lomariocycas schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal maintenance once established. Due to its endangered status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
