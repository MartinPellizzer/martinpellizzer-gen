    "intro": "Leptoglottis paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense rosette, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying New Zealand's native flora."
