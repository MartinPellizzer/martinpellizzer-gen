    "intro": "Leucheria ibarii var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered leucheria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white, often with a contrasting yellow or orange corona. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the stems are often covered in fine, short hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment."
