    "intro": "Lotus salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's lotus, is a rare and endangered aquatic plant native to the western Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom substrate while its stems and leaves remain above water. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
