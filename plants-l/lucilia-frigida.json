    "intro": "Lucilia frigida, commonly known as the cold-loving fungus gnat, is a species of fly belonging to the family Mycetophilidae. It is characterized by its small size and delicate wings, often found in cool, moist environments. The larvae of Lucilia frigida feed on decaying organic matter, playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest soils. This species is typically associated with fungal substrates, which provide both food and habitat. Its life cycle is closely linked to the presence of fungi, making it an important indicator of certain ecological conditions."
