    "intro": "Lactuca augustana, commonly known as the August lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
