    "intro": "Leopoldinia, commonly known as the leopoldinia tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The tree is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic pulp and is often used in local cuisines. Due to its ornamental value and unique flavor, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for its edible fruits."
