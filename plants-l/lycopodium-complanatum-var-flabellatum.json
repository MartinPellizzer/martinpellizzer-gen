    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. flabellatum, commonly known as the flat-leaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around its stem. Its sporophylls are closely clustered, forming cone-like structures that produce spores. This variety is notable for its distinctive leaf shape and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
