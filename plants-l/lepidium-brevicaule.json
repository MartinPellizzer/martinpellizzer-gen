    "intro": "Lepidium brevicaule, commonly known as peppergrass, is a small annual flowering plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in small, round pods that split open when mature, releasing tiny seeds. Lepidium brevicaule is adapted to thrive in harsh environments and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
