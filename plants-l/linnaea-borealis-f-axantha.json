    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. axantha, commonly known as the red-flowered twinleaf, is a rare variant of the twinleaf plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange flowers, which contrast with the typical white blooms of the species. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and its role in ecological studies of plant variation."
