It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, green, and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests and cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The orchid's unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms make it an important part of its ecosystem."
