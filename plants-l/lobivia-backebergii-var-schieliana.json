It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
