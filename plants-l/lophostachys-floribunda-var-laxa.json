    "intro": "Lophostachys floribunda var. laxa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with small, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
