    "intro": "Lycopodium lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia that release spores for reproduction. Lycopodium lancifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
