    "intro": "Leptopus chinensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Chinese bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
