    "intro": "Lophocereus schottii var. australis, commonly known as the Australian night bloomer, is a cactus native to southern Australia. It is a spineless plant with cylindrical stems that branch at the base, forming a low, sprawling shrub. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique nocturnal flowering habit and adaptability to harsh conditions make it a notable species in its native habitat."
