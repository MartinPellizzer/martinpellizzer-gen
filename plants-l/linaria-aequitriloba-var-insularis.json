It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
