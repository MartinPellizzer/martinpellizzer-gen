    "intro": "Lupinus wyethii var. prunophilus, commonly known as the prunophilus lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that mature into a dry, dehiscent structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
