    "intro": "Lantana viburnoides subsp. masaica, commonly known as the Masaica lantana, is a shrub native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
