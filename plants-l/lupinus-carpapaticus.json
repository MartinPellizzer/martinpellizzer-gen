    "intro": "Lupinus carpapaticus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus carpapaticus is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
