    "intro": "Leptotaenia multifida, commonly known as the fragrant fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Leptotaenia multifida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
