    "intro": "Leptochloa hirta, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial grass native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish to reddish inflorescences that resemble small clouds, which are typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Leptochloa hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
