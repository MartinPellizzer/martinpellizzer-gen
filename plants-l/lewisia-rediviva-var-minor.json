    "intro": "Lewisia rediviva var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Lewisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Oregon and northern California. It features dense clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. This variety is smaller than the typical Lewisia rediviva, with shorter stems and compact growth habits."
