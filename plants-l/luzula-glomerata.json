    "intro": "Luzula glomerata, commonly known as the clustered woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features dense clusters of grass-like leaves that form a low, mat-like growth habit. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Luzula glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
