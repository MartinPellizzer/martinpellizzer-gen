    "intro": "Lobivia katagirii var. aureorubriflora, commonly known as the Golden Red-Flowered Lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features compact, rounded stems covered in dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers that range from orange to red, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
