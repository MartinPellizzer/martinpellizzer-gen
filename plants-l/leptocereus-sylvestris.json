    "intro": "Leptocereus sylvestris, commonly known as the forest cholla, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny plant with a distinctive branching structure that resembles a shrub. The plant features small, cylindrical stems covered in sharp, pale spines, which help protect it from herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Leptocereus sylvestris is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems to survive in dry conditions."
