    "intro": "Lonicera campanifolia, commonly known as the bellflower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Lonicera campanifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and fragrant blooms."
