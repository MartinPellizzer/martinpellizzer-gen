It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate, hence the variety name, and are often fragrant when crushed. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
