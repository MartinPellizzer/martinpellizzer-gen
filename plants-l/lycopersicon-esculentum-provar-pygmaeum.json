It features smaller, rounder fruits compared to standard tomato cultivars, typically weighing less than 50 grams. The plant has a bushy growth habit with short stems and dense foliage, making it ideal for small garden spaces. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in umbels, typical of the Solanaceae family. This variety is prized for its early maturity and suitability for container gardening."
