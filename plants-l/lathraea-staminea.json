    "intro": "Lathraea staminea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant has a short, fleshy stem with a single, small, white or pale green flower that blooms in late spring. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature and delicate appearance, it is often overlooked in the wild."
