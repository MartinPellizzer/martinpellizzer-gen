    "intro": "Larix potaninii var. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The tree produces needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow before falling in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine forests and rocky slopes."
