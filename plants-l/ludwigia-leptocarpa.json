It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and vibrant red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in these habitats.
