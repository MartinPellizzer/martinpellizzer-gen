    "intro": "Lupinus glareosus, commonly known as the silver lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its silvery-blue flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Lupinus glareosus has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
