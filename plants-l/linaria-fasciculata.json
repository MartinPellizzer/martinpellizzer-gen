    "intro": "Linaria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to their nectar-rich structure. Linaria fasciculata is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant."
