    "intro": "Lespedeza buergeri, commonly known as Japanese strangleweed, is a perennial shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a notable ecological concern in some areas."
