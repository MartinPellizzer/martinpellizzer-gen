    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus var. platyspermus, commonly known as the broad-seeded vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, climbing stems with pinnately compound leaves composed of oval, hairy leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its seeds are encased in flat, broad pods, which contribute to its common name. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in agriculture and horticulture."
