    "intro": "Lepanthes selenitepala, commonly known as the silver moon orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a central spathaceous structure that resembles a moon, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer, producing a delicate fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. The botanical features of Lepanthes selenitepala make it a unique and sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and orchid collections."
