    "intro": "Leucheria fasciata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or yellowish sap. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
