    "intro": "Laelia \u00d7 gouldiana, commonly known as the Gould's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil, and thrives in cool, humid environments. Laelia \u00d7 gouldiana is prized by orchid growers for its resilience and ability to produce multiple blooms throughout the year. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid that exemplifies the genetic diversity within the Laelia genus."
