    "intro": "Lepidogrammitis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a type of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to trees or rocks. Lepidogrammitis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
