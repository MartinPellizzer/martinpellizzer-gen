    "intro": "Luma pitra, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Himalayas, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Nepal and India. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, fibrous stems. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow, still waters. Luma pitra is not only a botanical marvel but also holds cultural and spiritual significance in local traditions."
