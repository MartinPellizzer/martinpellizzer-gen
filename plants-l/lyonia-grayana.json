    "intro": "Lyonia grayana, commonly known as the grayleaf lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Lyonia grayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
