    "intro": "Lilium tsingtauense var. carneum, commonly known as the pink-tipped lily, is a rare and striking variation of the Tsingtau lily. It is characterized by its vibrant pink petals that gradually transition to white at the base, creating a unique and eye-catching appearance. This plant is native to China and is often found in woodland areas with moist, well-drained soils. It typically blooms in late summer, producing fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a specialty plant in horticulture."
