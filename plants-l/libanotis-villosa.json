    "intro": "Libanotis villosa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Libanotis villosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
