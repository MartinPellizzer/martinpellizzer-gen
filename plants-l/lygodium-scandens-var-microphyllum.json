    "intro": "Lygodium scandens var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, cascading appearance. The plant typically grows as a vine, climbing along trees or shrubs using its wiry stems. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in humid, shaded garden settings."
