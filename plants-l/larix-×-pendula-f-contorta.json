    "intro": "Larix \u00d7 pendula f. contorta, commonly known as the weeping larch, is a hybrid coniferous tree that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a natural cross between Larix decidua (European larch) and Larix gmelinii (Siberian larch), resulting in a tree with distinctive weeping branches. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. This variety is often cultivated for its striking appearance and is well-suited to temperate climates."
