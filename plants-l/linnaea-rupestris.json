    "intro": "Linnaea rupestris, commonly known as the rock twinflower, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces delicate, nodding white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, rocky or humus-rich soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Linnaea rupestris is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated in rock gardens or woodland settings."
