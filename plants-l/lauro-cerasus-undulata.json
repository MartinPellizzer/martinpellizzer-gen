    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus undulata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are slightly wavy in appearance. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red, cherry-like fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in its leaves and fruits."
