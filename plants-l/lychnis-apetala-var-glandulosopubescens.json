    "intro": "Lychnis apetala var. glandulosopubescens, commonly known as the glandular-hairy sand pink, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with erect, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are characteristic of the glandular pubescence that gives it its botanical name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas."
