    "intro": "Lycopodium sellowianum, commonly known as the Sellow's clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium sellowianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its dense, compact growth habit."
