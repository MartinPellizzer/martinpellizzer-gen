    "intro": "Lepidium diffusum, commonly known as wild cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers and its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Lepidium diffusum is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
