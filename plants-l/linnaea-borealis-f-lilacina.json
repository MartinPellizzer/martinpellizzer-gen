    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. lilacina, commonly known as the pink twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-lilac flowers, which are smaller and more delicate than the typical white flowers of the species. The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and relies on insect pollination. This rare form is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and limited distribution."
