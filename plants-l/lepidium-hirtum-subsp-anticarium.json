    "intro": "Lepidium hirtum subsp. anticarium, commonly known as the Armenian cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a small annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that dehisce to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
