    "intro": "Laurus flava, commonly known as the yellow laurel, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are typically yellow to golden in color, which distinguish it from its more commonly known relative, the sweet bay laurel. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and fragrance, it is often cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and aromatic purposes."
