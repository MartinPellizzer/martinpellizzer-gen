    "intro": "Loxotrema lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian lichen, is a species of crustose lichen found primarily in Mediterranean regions. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its tightly adhering, foliose thallus. The lichen typically grows on rock surfaces, especially in sunny, dry environments. It has a pale yellow to orange coloration when fresh, which fades to a dull brown with age. Loxotrema lusitanica is known for its chemical composition, including various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
