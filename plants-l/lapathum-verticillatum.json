    "intro": "Lapathum verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled toothwax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to spread through rhizomes. Lapathum verticillatum is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
