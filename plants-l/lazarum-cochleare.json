It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its spirally twisted stems, which help it climb and support its growth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds."
