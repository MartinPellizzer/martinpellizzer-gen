    "intro": "Lathyrus polymorphus subsp. incanus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to twine around supports. It has a fibrous root system and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. The subspecies incanus is distinguished by its more hairy stems and leaves compared to other subspecies of Lathyrus polymorphus."
