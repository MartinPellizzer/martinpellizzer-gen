    "intro": "Linosyris rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate linseed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Pedaliaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its seeds are encased in a hard, capsule-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. Linosyris rostrata is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
