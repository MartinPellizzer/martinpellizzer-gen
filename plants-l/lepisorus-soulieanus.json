    "intro": "Lepisorus soulieanus, commonly known as the Souchong fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Lepisorus genus."
