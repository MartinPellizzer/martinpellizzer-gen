    "intro": "Limonium semenowii, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to saline and sandy soils. It is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands, where it thrives in full sun. Limonium semenowii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
