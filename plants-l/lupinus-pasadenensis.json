    "intro": "Lupinus pasadenensis, commonly known as the Pasadena lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Lupinus pasadenensis plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
