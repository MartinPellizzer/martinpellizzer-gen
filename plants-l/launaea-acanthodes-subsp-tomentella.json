    "intro": "Launaea acanthodes subsp. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and spiny stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
