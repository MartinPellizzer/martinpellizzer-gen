It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, rounded seed pods that release seeds by wind. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability to harsh environments."
