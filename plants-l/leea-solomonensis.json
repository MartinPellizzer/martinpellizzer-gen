    "intro": "Leea solomonensis, commonly known as Solomon's leeah, is a flowering plant native to the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically found at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments within its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
