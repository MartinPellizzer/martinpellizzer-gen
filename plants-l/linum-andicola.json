    "intro": "Linum andicola, commonly known as the Andean flax, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to other flax species, but it is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. Linum andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and has potential for ecological and agricultural use in its native habitat."
