    "intro": "Lathyrus hispanicus, commonly known as Spanish vetch or hispanic vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and grasslands. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lathyrus hispanicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
