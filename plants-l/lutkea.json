    "intro": "Lutkea, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests or along stream banks. Lutkea lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thallus that absorb water and nutrients directly from the environment. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. The plant plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
