    "intro": "Laelia tenebrosa var. marlfield, commonly known as the Marlfield dark laelia, is a hybrid orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and a striking contrast with its lighter lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, high-altitude environments. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and role in orchid hybridization studies."
