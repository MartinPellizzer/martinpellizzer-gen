It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but contain toxic compounds for humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient species in its native range."
