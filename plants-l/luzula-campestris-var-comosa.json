    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. comosa, commonly known as the tufted woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. It blooms with small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers during the spring and early summer. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
