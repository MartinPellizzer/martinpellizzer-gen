    "intro": "Lepisorus venosus, commonly known as the veiny rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, vein-like patterns, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Lepisorus venosus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often found in horticultural collections due to its unique foliage."
