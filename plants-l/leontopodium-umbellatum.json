    "intro": "Leontopodium umbellatum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a rounded inflorescence, which is often surrounded by the fuzzy, white bracts. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique beauty and association with alpine landscapes, it is a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
