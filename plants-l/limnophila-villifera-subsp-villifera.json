    "intro": "Limnophila villifera subsp. villifera, commonly known as the water thyme, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Pontederiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, floating or submerged growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous blue or purple flowers. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
