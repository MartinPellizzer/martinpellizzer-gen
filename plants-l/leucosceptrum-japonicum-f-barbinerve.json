It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its unique feature is the presence of barbed nerves on the leaves, which give it the specific epithet *barbinerve*. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often grown in gardens for its delicate appearance."
