It is a small to medium-sized epiphytic orchid, characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically has a short, stocky rhizome and produces clustered inflorescences with showy, spurred petals. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid between Lepanthes albilabris and Lepanthes stenosepala, contributing to the genetic diversity within the genus. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and unique floral structure."
