    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris subsp. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in open landscapes and is relatively drought-tolerant."
