    "intro": "Lactuca spinosa, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant grows up to 1 meter tall and has a hairy stem that often branches near the base. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a bitter taste, while the seeds are small and wind-dispersed. Lactuca spinosa is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
