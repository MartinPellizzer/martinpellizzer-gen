    "intro": "Lysimachia circaeoides var. lyratifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf threadleaf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, opposite leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to dense pubescence. The plant bears tiny, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage and floral structure make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
