    "intro": "Limnophila glabra, commonly known as the slender water plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, green leaves are arranged oppositely and are usually hairless on the upper surface. Limnophila glabra produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it is often used in traditional medicine."
