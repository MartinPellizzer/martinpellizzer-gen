    "intro": "Lepidium flavum, commonly known as yellow peppergrass, is an annual flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded seeds. Its leaves are alternate, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive, peppery aroma. Lepidium flavum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
