    "intro": "Lechea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its morphologically variable leaves, which can range from elongated to broad and can be either dorsiventral or isobilateral. This liverwort typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures include capsules that release spores, and it often forms dense mats on substrates. The plant's adaptability to different microhabitats contributes to its widespread distribution in temperate regions."
