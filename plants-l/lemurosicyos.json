    "intro": "Lemurosicyos, commonly known as the ghost vine, is a climbing plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions. The botanical name reflects its ghostly appearance and its association with the Lemur genus in some taxonomic classifications."
