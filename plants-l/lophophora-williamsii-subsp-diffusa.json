    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the \"peyote\" variant, is a cacti species native to the Chihuahuan Desert of North America. It is characterized by its short, ribbed stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline. It is a slow-growing, spineless species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its legal status and conservation concerns, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
