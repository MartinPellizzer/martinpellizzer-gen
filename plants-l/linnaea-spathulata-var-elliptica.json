    "intro": "Linnaea spathulata var. elliptica, commonly known as the broad-leaf twinflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It features opposite, elliptic-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for rich, undisturbed forest soils."
