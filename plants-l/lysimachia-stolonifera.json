    "intro": "Lysimachia stolonifera, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has spreading stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or along stream banks."
