    "intro": "Lithomyrtus linariifolia, commonly known as the coastal mallees, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lithomyrtus linariifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in arid and windy environments."
