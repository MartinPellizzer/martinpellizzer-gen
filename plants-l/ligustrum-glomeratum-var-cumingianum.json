It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and adaptability. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
