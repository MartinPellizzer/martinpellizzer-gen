It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by large, woody fruits containing a single, edible seed. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
