    "intro": "Lomandra confertifolia subsp. leptostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stalked lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a distinctive, fibrous texture. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and rocky outcrops. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
