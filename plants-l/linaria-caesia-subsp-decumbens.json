    "intro": "Linaria caesia subsp. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid environments. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
