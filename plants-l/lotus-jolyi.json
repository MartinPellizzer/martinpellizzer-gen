    "intro": "Lotus jolyi, commonly known as the Joly's lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of its habitat. Lotus jolyi is valued for its ornamental beauty and has limited cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements."
