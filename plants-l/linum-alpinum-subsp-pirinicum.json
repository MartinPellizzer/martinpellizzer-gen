    "intro": "Linum alpinum subsp. pirinicum, commonly known as the Pirin flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains. It is a member of the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are small and capsule-like. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and adaptations to harsh mountain environments."
