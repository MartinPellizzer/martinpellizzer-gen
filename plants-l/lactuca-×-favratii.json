    "intro": "Lactuca \u00d7 favratii, commonly known as the hybrid lettuce, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Lactuca sativa (common lettuce) and Lactuca serriola (wild lettuce). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a mix of leaf morphology and growth habits. The plant typically has a rosette growth form with hairy, lobed leaves that vary in color from light green to reddish. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a range of environmental conditions. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for commercial use but is of interest in botanical studies."
