    "intro": "Lightfootia ericoidella, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 inches, with dense, compact foliage that forms a cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are dark green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often dry, acidic habitats. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lightfootia ericoidella thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathland environments."
