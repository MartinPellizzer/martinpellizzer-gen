    "intro": "Lomatia sylvatica, commonly known as the mountain lomatia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, prickly foliage and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments. Lomatia sylvatica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
