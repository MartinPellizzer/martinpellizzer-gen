    "intro": "Languas iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote langush, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
