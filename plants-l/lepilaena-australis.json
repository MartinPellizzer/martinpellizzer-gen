    "intro": "Lepilaena australis, commonly known as the southern sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous communities. Lepilaena australis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various pollinators and providing shelter for small fauna."
