It features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive tricolor pattern of white, green, and yellow. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for hedges and garden borders."
