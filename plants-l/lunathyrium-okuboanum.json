    "intro": "Lunathyrium okuboanum, commonly known as the Okubo's moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close during the day, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant has slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale lavender, with a subtle fragrance that attracts moths and other night-flying pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
