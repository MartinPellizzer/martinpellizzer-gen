The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, often arranged in a spiral. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Liparis alata is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
