It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It has a low-growing habit and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant is also valued for its role in ecological systems, supporting pollinators and improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
