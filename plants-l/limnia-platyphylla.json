    "intro": "Limnia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often green with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow. Limnia platyphylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
