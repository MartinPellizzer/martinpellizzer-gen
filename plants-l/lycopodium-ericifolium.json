    "intro": "Lycopodium ericifolium, commonly known as the heath clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and pine forests. Lycopodium ericifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
