    "intro": "Litobrochia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
