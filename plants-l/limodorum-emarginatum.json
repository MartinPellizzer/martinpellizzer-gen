It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It produces berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Liliaceae family."
