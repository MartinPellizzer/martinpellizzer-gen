    "intro": "Lycium mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lycium mediterraneum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
