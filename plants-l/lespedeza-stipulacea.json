It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive stipule at the base of each leaf pair. Its small, yellow flowers appear in racemes during the summer months, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lespedeza stipulacea is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
