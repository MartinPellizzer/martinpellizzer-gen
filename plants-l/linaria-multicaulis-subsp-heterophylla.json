    "intro": "Linaria multicaulis subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable flaxflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and variable leaf shapes, which can range from lanceolate to ovate. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical variability makes it an interesting subject for taxonomic study and horticultural cultivation."
