    "intro": "Leptospermum scoparium var. parvum, commonly known as the small-flowered manuka, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces a distinctive honey-like resin, which is used in various traditional and commercial applications. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming dense thickets. This variant is closely related to the more widely known manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) but is distinguished by its smaller flowers and growth form."
