    "intro": "Lycopodium mildbraedii, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. Native to the southeastern United States, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Lycopodium mildbraedii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
