    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum subvar. foliaceum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a low-growing evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a creeping rhizome with clustered, scale-like leaves that form a dense mat on the forest floor. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically reddish-brown in color. Its leaves are typically 2\u20134 cm long and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
