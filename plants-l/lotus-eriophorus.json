    "intro": "Lotus eriophorus, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a species of water lily native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, floating leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in shallow water and absorb nutrients. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening for only a few days before closing. Lotus eriophorus plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
