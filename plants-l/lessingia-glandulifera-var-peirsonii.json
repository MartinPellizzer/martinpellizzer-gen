    "intro": "Lessingia glandulifera var. peirsonii, commonly known as the Peirson's stickyleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. This variety is part of the Geraniaceae family and is known for its adaptation to arid conditions."
