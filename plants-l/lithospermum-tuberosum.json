It features a rhizomatous root system and produces striking violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains small, dark brown seeds. The roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
