    "intro": "Lechea ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is part of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. Its leaves are often lobed and have a distinctive three-leaf structure, giving it its scientific name. Lechea ternifolia is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
