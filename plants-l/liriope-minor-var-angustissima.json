    "intro": "Liriope minor var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf liriope, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in loose clusters. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. This variety is more compact than other liriope species, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
