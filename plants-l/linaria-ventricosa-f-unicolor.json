    "intro": "Linaria ventricosa f. unicolor, commonly known as the single-flowered wallflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features upright, branching stems that produce clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is particularly valued for its ability to bloom profusely in full sun and its use in rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and visually appealing choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
