The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Lophochloa cristata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
