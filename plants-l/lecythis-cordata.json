    "intro": "Lecythis cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf lecythis, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a single, large seed. The plant belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. Its bark and seeds have been used in traditional medicine, though its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The tree is also valued for its durable timber, though it is threatened by deforestation."
