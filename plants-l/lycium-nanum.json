    "intro": "Lycium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange-red berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lycium nanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense screens."
