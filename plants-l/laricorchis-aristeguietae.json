    "intro": "Laricorchis aristeguietae, commonly known as the Andean tassel orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tassel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows on the trunks of coniferous trees, particularly in high-altitude cloud forests. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, adapted to attract specific pollinators in its specialized habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered endangered and is of interest for botanical research."
