    "intro": "Linaria litoralis var. pterospora, commonly known as the coastal horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing sand dunes."
