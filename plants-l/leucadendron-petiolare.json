    "intro": "Leucadendron petiolare, commonly known as the silverleaf candle bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, candle-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
