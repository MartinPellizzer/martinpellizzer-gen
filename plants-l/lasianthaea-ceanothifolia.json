    "intro": "Lasianthaea ceanothifolia, commonly known as the coastal beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects."
