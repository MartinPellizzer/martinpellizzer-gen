    "intro": "Loxanthocereus clavispinus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white or pink. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
