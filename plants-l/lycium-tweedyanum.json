    "intro": "Lycium tweedyanum, commonly known as the Tweedya lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with a tubular shape, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lycium tweedyanum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
