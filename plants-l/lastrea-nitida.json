    "intro": "Lastrea nitida, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
