    "intro": "Lonicera flexuosa f. aureoreticulata, commonly known as the golden reticulated honeysuckle, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, dark green leaves and its most striking feature: clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that appear in late spring. The flowers are typically borne in racemes and have a distinctive reticulated pattern on their corollas, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
