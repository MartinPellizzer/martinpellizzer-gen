    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. oliganthum, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny flowers. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and high seed production make it a persistent and competitive species in various habitats."
