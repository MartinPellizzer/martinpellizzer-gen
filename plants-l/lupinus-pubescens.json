    "intro": "Lupinus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus pubescens is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitats."
