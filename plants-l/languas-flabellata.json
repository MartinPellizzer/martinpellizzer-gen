    "intro": "Languas flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaved orchid, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, fan-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, often resembling orchids in appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Languas flabellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and private collections."
