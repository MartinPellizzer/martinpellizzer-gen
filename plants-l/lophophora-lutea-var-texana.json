    "intro": "Lophophora lutea var. texana, commonly known as the Texas prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, showy flowers and succulent, spiny stems that help it survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its fleshy leaves and stems store water, making it a hardy species well-suited for xerophytic conditions. The Texas prickly poppy is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native range."
