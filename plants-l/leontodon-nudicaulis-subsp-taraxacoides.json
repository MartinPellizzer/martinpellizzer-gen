    "intro": "Leontodon nudicaulis subsp. taraxacoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that develop into elongated, thin seed stems. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. The species is characterized by its simple, unbranched stem and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
