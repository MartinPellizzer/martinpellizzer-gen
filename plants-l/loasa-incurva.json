    "intro": "Loasa incurva, commonly known as the creeping loasa, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Loasa incurva thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
