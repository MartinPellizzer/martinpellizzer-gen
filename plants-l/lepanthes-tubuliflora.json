    "intro": "Lepanthes tubuliflora, commonly known as the tubular orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without parasitizing them. Lepanthes tubuliflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
