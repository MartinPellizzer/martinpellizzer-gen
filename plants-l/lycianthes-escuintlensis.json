    "intro": "Lycianthes escuintlensis, commonly known as the Escuintla nightshade, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly found in Guatemala and Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries. The berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe, making careful consumption essential."
