    "intro": "Lonicera prolifera, commonly known as the creeping honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground or climb. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Lonicera prolifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
