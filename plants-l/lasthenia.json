    "intro": "Lasthenia, commonly known as the \"golden weed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are native to North America, particularly California, and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. They are characterized by their small, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Lasthenia species are often used in native plant gardens due to their low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
