    "intro": "Lebretonia semiserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky shores, thriving in saline and humid environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms. Lebretonia semiserrata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
