    "intro": "Ligularia reniformis, commonly known as the broadleaf ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to China. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
