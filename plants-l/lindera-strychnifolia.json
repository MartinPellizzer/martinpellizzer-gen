    "intro": "Lindera strychnifolia, commonly known as poison ivy vine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it can cause skin irritation in humans and is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
