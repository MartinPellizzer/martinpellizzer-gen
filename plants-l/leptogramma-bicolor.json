    "intro": "Leptogramma bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant has a distinct coloration, with the upper surface of the fronds being a lighter green and the underside a darker, almost blackish hue. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often in shaded environments. Leptogramma bicolor plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
