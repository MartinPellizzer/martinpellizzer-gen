    "intro": "Lastrea maranguensis, commonly known as the Maranguense Lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and ability to store water. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers, when present, are small and typically yellow or orange, adding a striking contrast to the plant's foliage."
