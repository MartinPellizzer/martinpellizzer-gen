    "intro": "Loranthus chinensis var. formosanus, commonly known as the Formosan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Southeast Asia, including Taiwan, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest ecosystems."
