    "intro": "Lasiopetalum biloculatum, commonly known as the two-lobed sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
