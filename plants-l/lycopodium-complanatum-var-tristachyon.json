    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. tristachyon, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to the eastern United States. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays a role in forest floor ecosystems."
