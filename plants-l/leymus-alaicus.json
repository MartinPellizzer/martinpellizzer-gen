    "intro": "Leymus alaicus, commonly known as the steppe grass or Alaskan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to withstand drought and grazing, making it an important component of grassland ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion and contributes to soil stabilization in its native range."
