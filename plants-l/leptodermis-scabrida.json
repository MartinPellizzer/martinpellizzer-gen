    "intro": "Leptodermis scabrida, commonly known as the rough skin lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus with a rough, uneven surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil in temperate regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
