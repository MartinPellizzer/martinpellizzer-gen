    "intro": "Labordia cyrtandrae, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found along stream banks. It has small, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture and is known for its ecological importance to native pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Labordia cyrtandrae is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
