It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Linaria tenuis is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
