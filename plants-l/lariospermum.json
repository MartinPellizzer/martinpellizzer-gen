    "intro": "Lariospermum, commonly known as the \"blue poppy,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers, which are often borne on tall, slender stems. Lariospermum species typically thrive in cool, moist environments and are often found in mountainous regions. Their ornamental value has made them popular in horticulture, though they are not as widely cultivated as other poppy species."
