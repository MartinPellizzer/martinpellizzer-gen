It is characterized by its dense, white or pale yellow inflorescence surrounded by soft, woolly bracts. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Due to its beauty and ecological significance, it is a symbol of the Alps and is protected in many areas."
