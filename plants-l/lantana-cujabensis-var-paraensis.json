    "intro": "Lantana cujabensis var. paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense lantana, is a shrub native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
