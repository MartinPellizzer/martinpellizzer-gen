    "intro": "Limonium dubyi, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Limonium dubyi thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for seaside environments."
