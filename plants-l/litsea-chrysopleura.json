It is characterized by its fragrant, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a glossy surface. Litsea chrysopleura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
