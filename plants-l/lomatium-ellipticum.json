    "intro": "Lomatium ellipticum, commonly known as the slender lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers range in color from white to pale yellow. Lomatium ellipticum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
