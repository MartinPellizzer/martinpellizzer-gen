    "intro": "Lonicera sororia, commonly known as the yellow honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, twining stems that climb by means of small tendrils, often reaching lengths of several meters. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lonicera sororia thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
