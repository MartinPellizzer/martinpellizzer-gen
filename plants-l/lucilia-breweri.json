    "intro": "Lucilia breweri, commonly known as the black blowfly, is a species of fly found in various parts of the world. It is characterized by its dark, metallic appearance and is often associated with decaying organic matter. The plant-like structures it lays its eggs on are typically decomposing plant material, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems. While not a plant itself, it plays a role in the decomposition process that affects plant growth. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable substrates for egg-laying and larval development."
