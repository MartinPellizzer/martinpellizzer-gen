    "intro": "Lapidaria, commonly known as the stone plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves and stems that are adapted to arid environments. The plants typically have a compact growth habit and produce small, colorful flowers in shades of yellow, red, and purple. Lapidaria species are native to southern Africa, where they thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. They are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
