    "intro": "Lachnagrostis drummondiana, commonly known as Drummond's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and dry meadows. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
