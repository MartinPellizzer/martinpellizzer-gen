    "intro": "Lewisia cotyledon var. purdyi, commonly known as the Purdy's cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the coastal areas of Oregon and California. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
