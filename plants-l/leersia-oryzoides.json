    "intro": "Leersia oryzoides, commonly known as rice leersia, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of eastern and southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often green or reddish in color. It is adapted to seasonal flooding and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Leersia oryzoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
