    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus f. longepedunculatus, commonly known as the long pedunculate bird's-foot trefoil, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically arranged in elongated, drooping clusters. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. This variant is distinguished by its longer peduncles, which give it a more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Lotus corniculatus."
