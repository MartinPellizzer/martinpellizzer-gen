    "intro": "Lamium garganicum subsp. lasioclades, commonly known as the woolly deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
