It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from basal rosettes to alternate arrangements along the stem. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in terminal racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its adaptability to different light conditions makes it a versatile addition to native gardens."
