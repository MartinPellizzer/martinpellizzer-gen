    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The flowers are typically smaller and have shorter calyces compared to the typical form, giving it its botanical name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic forests. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
