    "intro": "Lepanthes mucronata, commonly known as the spurred orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with a distinctive spur at the base of the lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat fleshy, adapted to store moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
