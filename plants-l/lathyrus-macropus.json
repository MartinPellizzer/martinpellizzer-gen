It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Lathyrus macropus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
