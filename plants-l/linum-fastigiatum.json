It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens and wildflower meadows. Linum fastigiatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in textile production."
