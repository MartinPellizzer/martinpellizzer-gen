    "intro": "Larix griffithii var. mastersiana, commonly known as the Griffiths' larch, is a rare and botanically intriguing variant of the larch tree. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, specifically in northern India and Nepal. This variety is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its unique foliage, which consists of needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall. The cones are small and woody, typically maturing within a single season. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
