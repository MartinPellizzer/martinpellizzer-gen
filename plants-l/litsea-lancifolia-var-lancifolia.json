    "intro": "Litsea lancifolia var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved litsea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forest understories. Its aromatic foliage makes it a valuable plant in both ornamental horticulture and traditional medicine."
