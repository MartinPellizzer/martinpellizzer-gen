    "intro": "Linaria amethystea var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored toadflax, is a striking annual plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and yellow. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with two distinct lobes on each petal, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
