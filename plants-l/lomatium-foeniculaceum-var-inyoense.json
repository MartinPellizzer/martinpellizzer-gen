    "intro": "Lomatium foeniculaceum var. inyoense, commonly known as the Inyo lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence. It is native to the high elevations of the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada regions in California and Nevada. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance, while its flowers are small and white, forming dense clusters. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its habitat."
