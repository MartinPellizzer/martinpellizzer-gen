    "intro": "Latua pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered latua, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are broad and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are often a mix of white and pale yellow, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
