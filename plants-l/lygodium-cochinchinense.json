    "intro": "Lygodium cochinchinense, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in various regions."
