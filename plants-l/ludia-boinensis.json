    "intro": "Ludia boinensis, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, spiral-arranged leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Ludia boinensis is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used in African herbal medicine."
