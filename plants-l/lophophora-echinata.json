    "intro": "Lophophora echinata, commonly known as the Peyote Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that produce clusters of small, white flowers during the spring. The plant contains mescaline, a psychoactive alkaloid, making it significant in both traditional and modern contexts. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and minimal rainfall. Due to its cultural and medicinal importance, it is also protected in many regions."
