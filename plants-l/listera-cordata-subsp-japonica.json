    "intro": "Listera cordata subsp. japonica, commonly known as Japanese basketwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
