    "intro": "Lycopodium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, high-altitude environments. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves and produces sporangia that are clustered in cone-like structures called strobila. Lycopodium alpinum is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its resilience to harsh environmental conditions makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems."
