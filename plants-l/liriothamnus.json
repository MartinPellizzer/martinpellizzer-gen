    "intro": "Liriothamnus, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the high altitudes of the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Liriothamnus species are typically low-growing shrubs with a compact, mat-forming habit. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
