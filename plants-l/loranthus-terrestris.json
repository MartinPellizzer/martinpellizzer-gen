    "intro": "Loranthus terrestris, commonly known as the creeping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily trees and shrubs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often overlooked. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is found in various regions of Europe and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
