It is characterized by its serrated, prickly leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble small daisies. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant contains lactucin, a compound with potential medicinal properties. It is also known to be an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
