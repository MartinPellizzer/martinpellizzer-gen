    "intro": "Lotus uliginosus subsp. pisifolius, commonly known as the swamp lotus or water hibiscus, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features showy, pink or red flowers that bloom above water surfaces, often in marshy or aquatic habitats. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in waterlogged conditions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from muddy substrates. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
