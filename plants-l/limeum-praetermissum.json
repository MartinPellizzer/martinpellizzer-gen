    "intro": "Limeum praetermissum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and basal rosettes of fleshy, green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Limeum praetermissum is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, exhibiting features such as thick cuticles and deep root systems. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
