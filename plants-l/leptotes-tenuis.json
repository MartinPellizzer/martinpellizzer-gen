    "intro": "Leptotes tenuis, commonly known as the slender leaf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
