    "intro": "Launaea nudicaulis var. divaricata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, often lobed, and may be covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to rocky soils and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes."
