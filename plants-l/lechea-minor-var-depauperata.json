    "intro": "Lechea minor var. depauperata, commonly known as the lesser lechea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many areas."
