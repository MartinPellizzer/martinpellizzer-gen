    "intro": "Lygodium wrightii, commonly known as Wright's climbing fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and delicate, feathery fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and climb along trees and shrubs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The botanical features of Lygodium wrightii make it an important component of wetland and forest ecosystems."
