    "intro": "Lacmellea guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana millepore, is a rare and delicate fern native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lacmellea guyanensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
