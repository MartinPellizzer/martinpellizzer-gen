    "intro": "Lotus hosackioides, commonly known as the Chinese lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy, pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment, while its seeds are dispersed by water. Lotus hosackioides is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in Chinese culture."
