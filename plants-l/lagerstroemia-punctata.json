    "intro": "Lagerstroemia punctata, commonly known as the Southern Crape Myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, long-lasting bract clusters that range in color from pink to red, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, peeling bark that becomes attractive with age, and its leaves are typically oval with a pointed tip. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The flowers are not true flowers but modified leaves called bracts, which play a key role in the plant's visual appeal."
