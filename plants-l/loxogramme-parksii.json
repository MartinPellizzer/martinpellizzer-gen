    "intro": "Loxogramme parksii, commonly known as the Park's water starwort, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive star-shaped appearance due to its finely divided leaves. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in pools and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Loxogramme parksii plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
