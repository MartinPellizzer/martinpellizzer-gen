It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often prostrate or ascending. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
