    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the Himalayan regions. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spiral arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically clustered in small, compact structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. This variant is distinguished from the typical Lycopodium cernuum by its slightly different morphology and geographic distribution."
