    "intro": "Lepisorus excavatus var. mortonianus, commonly known as the Mortonian rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy fronds that often form dense, carpet-like growths on rocky substrates. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found on limestone or sandstone cliffs. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, and it is known for its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
