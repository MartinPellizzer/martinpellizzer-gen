    "intro": "Lycopodium lepidophyllum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of clubmoss native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The Christmas fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add year-round greenery to gardens."
