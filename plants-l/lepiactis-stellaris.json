    "intro": "Lepiactis stellaris, commonly known as the starflower, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped blossoms that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, with five petals arranged symmetrically around a central cluster of stamens. Lepiactis stellaris is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
