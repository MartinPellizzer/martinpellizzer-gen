    "intro": "Lycopodium \u00d7 sabinifolium subsp. sitchense, commonly known as the Sichuan clubmoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, a feature typical of the Lycopodiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
