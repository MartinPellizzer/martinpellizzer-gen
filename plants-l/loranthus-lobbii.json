    "intro": "Loranthus lobbii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Podocarpus*. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red, fleshy berries that are adapted for bird dispersal. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Due to its parasitic nature and specific ecological role, it plays an important part in the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
