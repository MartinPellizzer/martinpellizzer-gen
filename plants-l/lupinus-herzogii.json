    "intro": "Lupinus herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus herzogii is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators."
