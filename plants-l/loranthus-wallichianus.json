    "intro": "Loranthus wallichianus, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Himalayan region. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees for germination. This species plays an ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species."
