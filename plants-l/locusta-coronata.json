It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in landscaping and restoration projects. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry, open areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas quickly."
