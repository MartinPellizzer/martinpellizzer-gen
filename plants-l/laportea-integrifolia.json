    "intro": "Laportea integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive, slightly fuzzy texture. Laportea integrifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
