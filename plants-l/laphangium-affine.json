    "intro": "Laphangium affine, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found growing on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of air quality."
