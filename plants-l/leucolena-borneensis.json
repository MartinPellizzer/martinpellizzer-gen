    "intro": "Leucolena borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean whiteleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often pale green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
