    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus var. angustatus, commonly known as narrowleaf grasspea, is a variant of the grasspea plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is an annual legume characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing 1\u20134 elliptical seeds, which are used as a food source in some parts of the world. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often cultivated as a drought-resistant crop. However, like other members of the Lathyrus genus, it contains toxic alkaloids that can pose health risks if consumed in large quantities."
