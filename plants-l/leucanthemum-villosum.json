    "intro": "Leucanthemum villosum, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features showy yellow disc flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, which give it a daisy-like appearance. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides. Leucanthemum villosum is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
