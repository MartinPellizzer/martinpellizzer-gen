    "intro": "Labisia punctata, commonly known as the silver sword or silver leaf plant, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy texture. Labisia punctata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
