    "intro": "Lycopodioides limbata, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodioides limbata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living relic of early plant evolution."
