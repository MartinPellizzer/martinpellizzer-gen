    "intro": "Lonicera chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a red throat, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that matures in autumn, containing numerous seeds. Lonicera chinensis is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive flowers and vigorous growth."
