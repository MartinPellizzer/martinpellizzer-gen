    "intro": "Loxogramme lanceolata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The leaves are typically floating or submerged, depending on water conditions, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
