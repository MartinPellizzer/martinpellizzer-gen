    "intro": "Linanthus filiformis, commonly known as the slender flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Linanthus filiformis is often found in open habitats and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
