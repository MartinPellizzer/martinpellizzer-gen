It is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a pleasant, sweet aroma. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid environments. Lycaste suaveolens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
