    "intro": "Lepicephalus uralensis, commonly known as the Ural lepicephalus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the Ural Mountains region of Russia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
