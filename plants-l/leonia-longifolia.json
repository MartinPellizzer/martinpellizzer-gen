    "intro": "Leonia longifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Leonia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
