    "intro": "Ligularia corymbosa, commonly known as the Japanese ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers contribute to its ornamental value in aquatic and bog gardens."
