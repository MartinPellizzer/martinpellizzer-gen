    "intro": "Lindernia debilis, commonly known as the slender lindernia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Lindernia debilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
