    "intro": "Labordia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf labordia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Labordia pumila is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
