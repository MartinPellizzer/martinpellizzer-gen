    "intro": "Leiophaca, commonly known as the smooth-leaved orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. Leiophaca species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They produce delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns on their petals. Due to their ornamental value, some species of Leiophaca are cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
