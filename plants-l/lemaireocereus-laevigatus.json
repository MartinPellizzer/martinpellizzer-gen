It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
