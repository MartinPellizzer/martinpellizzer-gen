    "intro": "Leucojum vernum var. transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian snowflake, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms and is often found in woodland habitats. It is closely related to other members of the Amaryllidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental beauty. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
