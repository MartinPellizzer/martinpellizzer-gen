    "intro": "Lupinus pilosus var. luthereaui, commonly known as the hairy lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
