It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are drought-tolerant. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
