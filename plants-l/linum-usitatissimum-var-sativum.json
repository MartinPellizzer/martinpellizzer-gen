It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces blue or white flowers that are clustered in loose spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing small, oval seeds. Flax is cultivated primarily for its seeds, which are used to produce linseed oil and for nutritional purposes. Its fibrous stalks are also used in the textile industry, making it a versatile and historically significant plant."
