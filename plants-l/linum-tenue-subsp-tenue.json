    "intro": "Linum tenue subsp. tenue, commonly known as slender flax, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its fibrous stalks were historically used for fiber production, similar to other flax species."
