    "intro": "Lindsaea propria, commonly known as the Brazilian huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Lindsaea propria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
