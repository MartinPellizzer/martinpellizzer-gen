It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with distinctive red or purple markings, and it produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.
