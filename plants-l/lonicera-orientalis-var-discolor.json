    "intro": "Lonicera orientalis var. discolor, commonly known as the white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and pale or white on the underside, giving it a striking visual contrast. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The berries that follow the flowers are dark red and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed by humans as other honeysuckle varieties."
