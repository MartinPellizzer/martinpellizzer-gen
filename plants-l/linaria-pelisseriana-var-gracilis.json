    "intro": "Linaria pelisseriana var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
