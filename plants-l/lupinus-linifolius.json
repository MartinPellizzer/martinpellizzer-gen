    "intro": "Lupinus linifolius, commonly known as the slender leaf lupine, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its tall, spindly growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus linifolius is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
