    "intro": "Leptocarpus aristatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea grape, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in saline or brackish water environments, often found in tidal zones and mangrove areas. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils, making it ecologically significant in shoreline ecosystems. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through water, aiding in its propagation along coastal regions."
