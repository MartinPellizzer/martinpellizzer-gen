    "intro": "Loranthus oreophilus var. obtusatus, commonly known as the smoothleaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and lacks true roots, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green color. This variant is distinguished by its more rounded leaf tips compared to other varieties of Loranthus."
