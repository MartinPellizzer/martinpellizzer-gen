    "intro": "Leymus secalinus var. flexus, commonly known as the flexible wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled when young. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as forage or in restoration ecology projects."
