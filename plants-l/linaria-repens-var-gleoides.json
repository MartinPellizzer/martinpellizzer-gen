    "intro": "Linaria repens var. gleoides, commonly known as the creeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
