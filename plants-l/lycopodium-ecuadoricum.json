    "intro": "Lycopodium ecuadoricum, commonly known as the Ecuador clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often needle-like in appearance, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium ecuadoricum is characterized by its primitive structure, which includes a root system and vascular tissue, making it a relic from early plant evolution. This species plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
