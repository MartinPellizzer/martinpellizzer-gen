    "intro": "Lotus uliginosus var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy marsh lotus, is a variant of the marsh lotus native to wetland habitats in Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it thrive in moist, sometimes boggy environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its leaves are typically floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This variant is often found in slow-moving water bodies and is valued for its ornamental qualities in aquatic gardens."
