    "intro": "Lantana lamiana, commonly known as the common lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
