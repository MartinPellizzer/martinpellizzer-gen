It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of white and blue. The plant has heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
