    "intro": "Lepidium berteronianum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that are often mistaken for those of other members of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Lepidium berteronianum is also known for its edible seeds, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
