    "intro": "Lycoseris macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed lycoperd, is a species of puffball fungus belonging to the family Lycoperdaceae. It is characterized by its large, spherical fruiting body that typically measures between 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter. The outer surface is initially covered with a dense layer of spore-bearing cells, which later become smooth as the spores are released. It thrives in grassy areas and is often found in disturbed soils, particularly in temperate regions. This fungus is notable for its lack of a stem and its ability to produce spores in a single, massive release."
