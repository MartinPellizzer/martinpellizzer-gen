    "intro": "Liparis chungthangensis, commonly known as the Chungthang orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
