    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum f. robustinus, commonly known as the robust clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a perennial evergreen with a creeping rhizome and erect, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
