    "intro": "Leptasea bronchialis, commonly known as the lungwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
