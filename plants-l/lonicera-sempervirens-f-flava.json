    "intro": "Lonicera sempervirens f. flava, commonly known as the yellow honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but generally considered toxic to humans. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
