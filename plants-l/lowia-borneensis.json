    "intro": "Lowia borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo lowia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lowia borneensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
