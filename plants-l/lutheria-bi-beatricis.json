    "intro": "Lutheria bi-beatricis, commonly known as the Beatrice's Lute, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and grows to a height of about 30 to 50 centimeters. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lutheria bi-beatricis is considered a vulnerable species."
