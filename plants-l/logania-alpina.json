    "intro": "Logania alpina, commonly known as the alpine logania, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and often grows in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Logania alpina is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
