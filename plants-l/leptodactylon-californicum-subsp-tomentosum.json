    "intro": "Leptodactylon californicum subsp. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly leathery fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are covered in a fine, woolly texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
