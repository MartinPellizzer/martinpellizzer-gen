    "intro": "Lactuca schweinfurthii, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination. Lactuca schweinfurthii is often found in sandy soils and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems."
