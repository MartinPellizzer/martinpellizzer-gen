    "intro": "Leucaena paniculata, commonly known as the silky leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Leucaena paniculata is also valued for its use in agroforestry and as a forage plant for livestock."
