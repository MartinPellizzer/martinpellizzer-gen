    "intro": "Leucheria millefolium f. major, commonly known as the large-leaved yarrow, is a variant of the yarrow plant characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the typical species. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in the summer. Its botanical structure supports its role as a hardy, drought-tolerant plant suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. The f. major form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
