It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
