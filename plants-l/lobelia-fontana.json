    "intro": "Lobelia fontana, commonly known as the water lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils. Lobelia fontana is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support pollinators."
