It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of dark green, leathery leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its botanical features make it well adapted to acidic, sandy soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
