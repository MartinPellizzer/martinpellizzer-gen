    "intro": "Lotodes candicans, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface, and its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water, allowing it to spread across ponds and lakes. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in water gardens."
