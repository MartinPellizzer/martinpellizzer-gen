    "intro": "Litobrochia ampla, commonly known as the giant rock fern, is a unique species of fern found in specific rocky habitats. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often on limestone or other calcareous substrates. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices. Litobrochia ampla plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
