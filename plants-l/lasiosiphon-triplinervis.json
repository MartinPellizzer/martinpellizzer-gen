    "intro": "Lasiosiphon triplinervis, commonly known as the three-veined morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant has a climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trees. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinct tripartite venation pattern, which is a key identifying feature. The flowers typically bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies."
