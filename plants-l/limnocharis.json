    "intro": "Limnocharis, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features rosettes of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom above the water surface. Limnocharis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water's surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
