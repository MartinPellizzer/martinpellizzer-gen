    "intro": "Lepidium inyangense, commonly known as the Inyang mustard, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the genus Lepidium."
