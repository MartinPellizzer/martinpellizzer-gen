    "intro": "Lemna minima, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with leaves typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Its simple morphology includes tiny, oval leaves and tiny flowers that produce small, yellowish fruits. Lemna minima is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and invertebrates."
