It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its ability to attract pollinators."
