    "intro": "Loranthus huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through the organic matter it produces. It is native to the Andean regions of South America and is often found in humid, mountainous environments. Its ecological role includes supporting various insect and bird species that depend on it for food and shelter."
