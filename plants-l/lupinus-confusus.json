    "intro": "Lupinus confusus, commonly known as the confused lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, spiky flower clusters that range in color from purple to white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus confusus has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
