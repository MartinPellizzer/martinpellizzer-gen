    "intro": "Lupinus eramosus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus eramosus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility for other plants."
