It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually lobed or serrated, giving it its common name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Lithocardium crenulatum is often found in open habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
