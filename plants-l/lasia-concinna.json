It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their diverse morphology and ecological roles. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and shrublands. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy surface, while its small white or yellow flowers are clustered in umbels. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
