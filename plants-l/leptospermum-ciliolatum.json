It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for garden planting in suitable climates."
