    "intro": "Loricaria, commonly known as the \"bearded\" or \"lady's mantle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often hairy or bristly leaves that give them their common name. Loricaria species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, and their seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and others for their medicinal properties."
