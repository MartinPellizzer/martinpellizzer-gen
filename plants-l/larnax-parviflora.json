    "intro": "Larnax parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered larnax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a favored choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
