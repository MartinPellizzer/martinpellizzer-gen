    "intro": "Lepturopetium kuniense, commonly known as the Kuni Island rockrose, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It is a member of the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. It has fleshy, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
