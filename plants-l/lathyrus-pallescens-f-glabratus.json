    "intro": "Lathyrus pallescens f. glabratus, commonly known as the glabrous lathyris, is a variant of the slender vetch. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically pale blue or violet, with a distinctive spurred structure at the base of the petals. This form is notable for its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical variety. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
