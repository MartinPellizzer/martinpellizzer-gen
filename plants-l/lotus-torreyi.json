    "intro": "Lotus torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey's lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality in its habitat. Lotus torreyi is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments like ponds and lakes."
