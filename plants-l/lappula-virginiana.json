    "intro": "Lappula virginiana, commonly known as common lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and roadside ditches. The plant features erect stems covered with soft, hairy foliage, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spherical heads. The seed pods are distinctive, being inflated and ribbed, and they release seeds when disturbed. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
