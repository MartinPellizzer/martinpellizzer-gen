    "intro": "Lotus uliginosus var. villosus, commonly known as the woolly marsh lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. The woolly marsh lotus is also valued for its ornamental qualities in water gardens."
