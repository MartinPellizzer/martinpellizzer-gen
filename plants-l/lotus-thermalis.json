    "intro": "Lotus thermalis, commonly known as the hot lotus, is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in warm, mineral-rich waters. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the late summer. The plant is native to certain regions in Asia, particularly in areas with thermal springs. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer that helps reduce water loss. Lotus thermalis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
