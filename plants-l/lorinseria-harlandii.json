    "intro": "Lorinseria harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's lorinseria, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive fruits that are elongated and fibrous. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lorinseria harlandii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
