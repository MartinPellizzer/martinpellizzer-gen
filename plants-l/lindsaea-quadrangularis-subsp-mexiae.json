    "intro": "Lindsaea quadrangularis subsp. mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a member of the family Lindsaeaceae and is native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant characterized by its delicate, branching structure and linear leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
