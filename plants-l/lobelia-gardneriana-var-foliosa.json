    "intro": "Lobelia gardneriana var. foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds."
