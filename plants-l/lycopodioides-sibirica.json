    "intro": "Lycopodioides sibirica, commonly known as Siberian clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, underground stem with clustered, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are arranged in cone-like clusters at the tips of the stems. Lycopodioides sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
