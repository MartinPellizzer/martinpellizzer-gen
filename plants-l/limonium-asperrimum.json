    "intro": "Limonium asperrimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads and silver-gray foliage. The plant thrives in coastal environments and well-drained soils, often growing in sandy or gravelly areas. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom in summer and are often used in dried floral arrangements. Limonium asperrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salty air and coastal conditions."
