    "intro": "Lupinus monserratensis, commonly known as theMontserrat lupine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces tall, upright stems with clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to withstand cold and dry conditions. Lupinus monserratensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
