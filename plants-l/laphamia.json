These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often grow in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their basal leaves and small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Laphamia species are often found in mountainous regions and are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for ecological and horticultural study."
