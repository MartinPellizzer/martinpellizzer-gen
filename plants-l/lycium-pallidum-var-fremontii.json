    "intro": "Lycium pallidum var. fremontii, commonly known as the Fremont lycium, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries and spiny, woody stems. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are usually small, oval, and have a slightly hairy texture. The Fremont lycium is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance."
