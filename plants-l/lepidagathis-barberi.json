    "intro": "Lepidagathis barberi, commonly known as the golden candelabra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique, branched inflorescence that resembles a candelabra. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, showy spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
