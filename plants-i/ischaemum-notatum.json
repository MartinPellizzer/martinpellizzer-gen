    "intro": "Ischaemum notatum, commonly known as hairy field grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow with a hairy texture. Its inflorescence is a loose panicle, bearing small spikelets that contain both male and female flowers. Ischaemum notatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
