    "intro": "Indosasa ingens, commonly known as the giant indosasa, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust growth habit. The plant can reach impressive heights, often exceeding 5 meters, making it a dominant feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid environment. The flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically yellow or orange, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
