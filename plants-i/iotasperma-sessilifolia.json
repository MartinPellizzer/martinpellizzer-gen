    "intro": "Iotasperma sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert shrub, is a hardy plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, sessile leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
