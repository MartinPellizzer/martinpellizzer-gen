    "intro": "Ifloga, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. They are characterized by their attractive, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, white, and yellow. Ifloga species typically have thick, fleshy leaves and are often grown as houseplants due to their ornamental value. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
