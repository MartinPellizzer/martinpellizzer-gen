It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain small, dark seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
