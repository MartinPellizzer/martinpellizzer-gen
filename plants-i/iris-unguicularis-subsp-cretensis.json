    "intro": "Iris unguicularis subsp. cretensis, commonly known as the Cretan iris, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive white or pale yellow throat. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces showy, sword-shaped blooms during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
