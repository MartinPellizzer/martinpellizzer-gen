    "intro": "Ilex coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically grayish-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Ilex coriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and year-round foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
