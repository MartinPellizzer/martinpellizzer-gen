It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
