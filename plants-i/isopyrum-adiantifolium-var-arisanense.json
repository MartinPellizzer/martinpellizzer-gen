    "intro": "Isopyrum adiantifolium var. arisanense, commonly known as the Arisan water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it can thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with some parts emerging above the water surface. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in maintaining water quality in its native habitats."
