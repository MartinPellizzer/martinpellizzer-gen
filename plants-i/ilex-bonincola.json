    "intro": "Ilex bonincola, commonly known as the Bonin holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex bonincola is often found in coastal habitats and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native range. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions outside its natural distribution."
