    "intro": "Itaculumia jordanensis, commonly known as the Jordanian itacolum, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Jordan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Itaculumia jordanensis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces fruits that are small and dry. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
