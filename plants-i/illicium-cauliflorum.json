It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers emerge directly from the trunk and branches. The plant produces small, fragrant berries that contain aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface. Illicium cauliflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
