    "intro": "Isoetes histrix var. phrygia, commonly known as the Phrygian watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spiky, sword-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant is found in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It produces small, dark brown spores rather than seeds, which are dispersed by water currents. This variety is notable for its morphological similarities to other Isoetes species, making it a subject of taxonomic interest."
