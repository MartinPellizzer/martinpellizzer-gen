    "intro": "Isoglossa dichotoma var. repens, commonly known as the creeping isoglossa, is a variant of the isoglossa plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit. It features opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland areas. This variant is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable habitats."
