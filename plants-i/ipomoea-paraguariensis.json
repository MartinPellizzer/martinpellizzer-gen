    "intro": "Ipomoea paraguariensis, commonly known as ayahuasca, is a climbing vine native to the Amazon basin. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily DMT, which contribute to its traditional use in spiritual and healing practices. Its roots and stems are typically used in preparation of the brew, which has been integral to indigenous cultures for centuries. The plant's botanical significance extends beyond its cultural role, offering insights into ethnobotany and medicinal plant research."
