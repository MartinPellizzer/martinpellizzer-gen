    "intro": "Inga grandis, commonly known as the giant tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and dense foliage, making it a valuable species for reforestation and agroforestry. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are compound, with multiple small leaflets, and the tree can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Inga grandis is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in degraded areas."
