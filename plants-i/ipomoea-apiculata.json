    "intro": "Ipomoea apiculata, commonly known as the red-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from red to purple. The plant blooms during the day, particularly in the morning, and has a rapid growth rate, often reaching several meters in length. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance and are pollinated primarily by insects. Ipomoea apiculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and as a decorative plant."
