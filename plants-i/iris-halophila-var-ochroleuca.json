    "intro": "Iris halophila var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and saline environments. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces showy, six-petaled flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. The plant is adapted to tolerate high salinity and is often found in coastal areas or inland salt marshes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
