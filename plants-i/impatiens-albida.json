    "intro": "Impatiens albida, commonly known as the white impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle pinkish hue. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its pale blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Impatiens albida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
