    "intro": "Isolepis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Isolepis micrantha thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies that help stabilize shorelines. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
