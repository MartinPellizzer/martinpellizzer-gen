    "intro": "Ixora capitulifera, commonly known as the clustered flame bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble clusters of small flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant, five-petaled blooms arranged in dense terminal clusters, which are often used in ornamental gardening. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant color and ornamental value. Ixora capitulifera is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
