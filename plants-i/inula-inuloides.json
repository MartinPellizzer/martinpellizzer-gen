    "intro": "Inula inuloides, commonly known as the yellow fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Inula inuloides is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
