It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and pine flatwoods. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in southern regions."
