    "intro": "Iris dichotoma, commonly known as the forked iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and grow in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand periods of drought. Iris dichotoma is often found in rocky habitats and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
