    "intro": "Inula salicina var. lineata, commonly known as the linear sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a tall, slender stem with finely dissected, linear leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and long-lasting blooms."
