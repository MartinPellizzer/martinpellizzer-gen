    "intro": "Isomeris, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. Isomeris species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They have adapted to thrive in dry conditions with their hairy leaves and deep root systems. The genus includes several species, such as Isomeris laciniata, which is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
