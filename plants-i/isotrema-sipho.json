    "intro": "Isotrema sipho, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its woody, aromatic bark. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs. Isotrema sipho is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for crafting and construction."
