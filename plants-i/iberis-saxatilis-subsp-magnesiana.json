    "intro": "Iberis saxatilis subsp. magnesiana, commonly known as the Magnesian candytuft, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has holly-like leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
