It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of pink to violet flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a useful plant in both landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
