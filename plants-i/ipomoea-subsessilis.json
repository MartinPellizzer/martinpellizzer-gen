    "intro": "Ipomoea subsessilis, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a desirable garden plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
