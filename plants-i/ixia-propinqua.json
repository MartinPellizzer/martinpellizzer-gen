It is characterized by its vivid orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive dry periods. Ixia propinqua thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
