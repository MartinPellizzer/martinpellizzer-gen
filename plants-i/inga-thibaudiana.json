    "intro": "Inga thibaudiana, commonly known as the \"coffee tree,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a valuable component of agroforestry systems. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The fruit, which is a pod, contains edible seeds that are sometimes used as a coffee substitute."
