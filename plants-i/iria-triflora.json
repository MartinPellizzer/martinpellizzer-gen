    "intro": "Iria triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered morning glory, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial vine, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that aid in climbing. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Iria triflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
