    "intro": "Ipomoea decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive morning glory, is a flowering vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a distinctive purple throat. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and thrives in warm, sunny environments. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
