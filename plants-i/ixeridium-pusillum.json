    "intro": "Ixeridium pusillum, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and has slender, wiry stems that are often reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a tendency to curl at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants."
