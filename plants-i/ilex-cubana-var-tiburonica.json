    "intro": "Ilex cubana var. tiburonica, commonly known as Tiburon Island holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Tiburon in Cuba. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a pointed shape. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
