    "intro": "Iris acutiloba subsp. demawendica, commonly known as the Demawenda iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
