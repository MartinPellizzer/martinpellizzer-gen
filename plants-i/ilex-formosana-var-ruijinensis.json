    "intro": "Ilex formosana var. ruijinensis, commonly known as the Ruijin holly, is a variant of the Formosan holly native to China. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens and landscapes. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it ideal for use as a hedge or specimen plant."
