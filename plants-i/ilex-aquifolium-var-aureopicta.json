This plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant leaf coloration. The leaves are typically ovate with spiny margins, and the plant produces small, red berries in the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for garden borders or as a specimen plant. The golden hue of its leaves intensifies in the sunlight, adding a unique visual appeal to landscapes."
