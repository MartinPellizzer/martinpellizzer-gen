    "intro": "Iridorkis helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's iris, is a rare and unique member of the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue and violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are long and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iridorkis helferi is considered a vulnerable species."
