    "intro": "Ilex ardisiifrons, commonly known as the red-leaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
