    "intro": "Inula tuberosa, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, blue or purple flower heads that resemble small globes, surrounded by spiky bracts. The plant has a robust root system and produces a milky sap when damaged. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Inula tuberosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
