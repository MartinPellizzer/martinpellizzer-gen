    "intro": "Indigofera retrusa, commonly known as the small indigo or African indigo, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in dry or semi-arid regions. The plant has been historically used for its dye-producing properties, though its botanical significance also lies in its role as a nitrogen-fixing species in ecological systems."
