    "intro": "Isoetes azorica, commonly known as the Azores watermace, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a specialized structure called a strobilus. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments, such as lakes and marshes, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its morphology includes a rosette of spiny, needle-like leaves that help it anchor in soft sediment. Isoetes azorica plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to aquatic biodiversity and providing habitat for microorganisms."
