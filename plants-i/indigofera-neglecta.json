    "intro": "Indigofera neglecta, commonly known as wild indigo, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant has a fibrous root system. While not widely cultivated for its flowers, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
