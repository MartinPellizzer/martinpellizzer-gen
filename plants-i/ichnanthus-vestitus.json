    "intro": "Ichnanthus vestitus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ichnanthus vestitus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions as a garden plant."
