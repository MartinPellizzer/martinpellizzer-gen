It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that are rich in alkaloids. The most notable alkaloid found in iboga is voacangine, which contributes to its psychoactive properties. The plant is typically harvested during the dry season when the roots are most potent. Its botanical structure includes dense foliage and small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters."
