    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. algarviensis, commonly known as the Algarve holly, is a variant of the common holly native to southern Portugal. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves with spiny margins, which are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
