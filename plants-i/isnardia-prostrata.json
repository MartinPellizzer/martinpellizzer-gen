    "intro": "Isnardia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
