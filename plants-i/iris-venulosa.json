    "intro": "Iris venulosa, commonly known as the slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Iris venulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
