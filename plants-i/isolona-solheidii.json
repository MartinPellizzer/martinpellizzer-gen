    "intro": "Isolona solheidii, commonly known as the Solheid's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing clusters of bell-shaped flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isolona solheidii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
