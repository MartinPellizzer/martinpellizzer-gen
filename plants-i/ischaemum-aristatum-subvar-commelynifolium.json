    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum subvar. commelynifolium, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color and are arranged in dense clusters. This subspecies is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance among other grasses."
