    "intro": "Ipomoea aculeata var. aculeata, commonly known as the spiny morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant is characterized by its sharp, stiff spines along the stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
