    "intro": "Isomacrolobium obanense, commonly known as the Obanese macrolobium, is a rare aquatic plant native to Scotland. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, strap-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant has a simple, branching structure with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
