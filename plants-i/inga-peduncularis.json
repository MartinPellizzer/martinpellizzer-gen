    "intro": "Inga peduncularis, commonly known as the red-river inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Inga peduncularis plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
