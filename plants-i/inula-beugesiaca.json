    "intro": "Inula beugesiaca, commonly known as the European elecampane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, daisy-like yellow flower heads. The plant produces ray florets that are typically yellow, surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Inula beugesiaca is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
