    "intro": "Ipomoea suffruticosa, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along fences and walls. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
