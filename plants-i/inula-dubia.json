    "intro": "Inula dubia, commonly known as the yellow fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Inula dubia is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
