    "intro": "Isolepis subtilis, commonly known as the slender tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their ecological importance in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of ponds. Its structure and growth habits make it an essential component of wetland ecosystems."
