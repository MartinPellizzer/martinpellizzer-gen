    "intro": "Ischurochloa spinosa, commonly known as the spiny buffalo grass, is a drought-tolerant perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has wiry, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
