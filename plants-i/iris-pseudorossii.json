    "intro": "Iris pseudorossii, commonly known as the Pseudoross's iris, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silky texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
