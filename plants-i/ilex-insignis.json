    "intro": "Ilex insignis, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Ilex insignis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
