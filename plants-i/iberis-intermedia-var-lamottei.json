    "intro": "Iberis intermedia var. lamottei, commonly known as the Lamotte's candytuft, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in coastal areas and dry slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in sunny, well-drained environments."
