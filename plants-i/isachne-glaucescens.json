    "intro": "Isachne glaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass or blue oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often tinged with a blue-green hue, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish sheen, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Isachne glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
