    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 rubicunda, commonly known as the red iris, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its striking violet to deep red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, with sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are dark green in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Iris \u00d7 rubicunda thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
