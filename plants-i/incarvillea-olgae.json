    "intro": "Incarvillea olgae, commonly known as the Desert Incarvillea, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions. Incarvillea olgae is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and low water requirements."
