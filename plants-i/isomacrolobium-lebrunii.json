    "intro": "Isomacrolobium lebrunii, commonly known as the Lesotho lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of Lesotho and South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes irises and related flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a single, spurred flower that is adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
