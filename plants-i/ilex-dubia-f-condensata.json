    "intro": "Ilex dubia f. condensata, commonly known as the denseleaf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are typically smaller and more rounded compared to other holly species. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for use in ornamental landscaping. Due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, it is often used as a hedge or border plant."
