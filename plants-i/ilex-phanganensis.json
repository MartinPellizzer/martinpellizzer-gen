    "intro": "Ilex phanganensis, commonly known as the Phangan holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex phanganensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical regions."
