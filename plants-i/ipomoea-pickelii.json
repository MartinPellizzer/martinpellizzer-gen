    "intro": "Ipomoea pickelii, commonly known as the Pickel's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ipomoea pickelii thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woods. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a vibrant, climbing plant."
