    "intro": "Ilex laevigata var. herveyi, commonly known as the Hervey's holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often growing in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
