    "intro": "Ixora bougainvilliae, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that range in color from red to orange and pink, which are often mistaken for flowers. The actual small, tubular flowers are yellow and bloom inside the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and ability to bloom throughout the year."
