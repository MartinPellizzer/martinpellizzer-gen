    "intro": "Impatiens barthlottii, commonly known as the Barthlott's impatiens, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Balsaminaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive corona of petal-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
