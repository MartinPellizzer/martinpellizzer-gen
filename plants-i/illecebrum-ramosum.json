    "intro": "Illecebrum ramosum, commonly known as the creeping thornapple, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, spiny fruits. Its stems and leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, which contribute to its rough texture. Illecebrum ramosum is typically found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
