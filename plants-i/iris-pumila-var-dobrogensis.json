It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue to violet flowers in early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of 10\u201320 cm, with a compact growth habit that allows it to thrive in open, sunny habitats. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and meadow environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
