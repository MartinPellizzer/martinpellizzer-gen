    "intro": "Ibatia dummelii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Ibatia dummelii is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the manufacture of musical instruments. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species."
