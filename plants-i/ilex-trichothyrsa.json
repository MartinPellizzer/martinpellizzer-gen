    "intro": "Ilex trichothyrsa, commonly known as the silky holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex trichothyrsa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded garden settings."
