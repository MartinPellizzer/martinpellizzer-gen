    "intro": "Imerinorchis nutans, commonly known as the nodding orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in humid environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, nodding flower that is usually pale green to yellowish in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The orchid's flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
