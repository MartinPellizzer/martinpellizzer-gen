It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
