    "intro": "Illigera trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance, making it a sought-after plant in horticulture."
