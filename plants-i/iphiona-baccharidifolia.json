    "intro": "Iphiona baccharidifolia, commonly known as the coastal dune shrub, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure with narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
