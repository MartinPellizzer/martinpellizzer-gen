    "intro": "Isoglossa membranacea subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern isoglossa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in loose racemes and bloom in early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and habitat preference, making it a notable component of its ecological community."
