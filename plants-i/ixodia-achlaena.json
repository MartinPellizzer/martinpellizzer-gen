    "intro": "Ixodia achlaena, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the branches. Ixodia achlaena is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
