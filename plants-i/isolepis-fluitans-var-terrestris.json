    "intro": "Isolepis fluitans var. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It is often found in shallow water or moist soils, contributing to the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
