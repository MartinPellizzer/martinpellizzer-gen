It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in ecological succession. Inga paterno is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its native habitats."
