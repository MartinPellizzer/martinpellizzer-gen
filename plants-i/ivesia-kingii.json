    "intro": "Ivesia kingii, commonly known as the King's ivesia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ivesia kingii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
