    "intro": "Iris longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered iris, is a species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its rhizomes are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and meadows. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
