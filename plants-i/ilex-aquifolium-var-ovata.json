    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly, characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated than those of the typical species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western regions of Europe, particularly in areas with moist, cool climates. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its dense foliage and evergreen nature make it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental landscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies due to their astringent properties."
