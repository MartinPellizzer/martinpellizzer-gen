    "intro": "Ipomoea platyclada, commonly known as the broad-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, broad leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. The plant is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to support itself. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, hence its common name. Ipomoea platyclada is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
