    "intro": "Ipomoea malvaeoides var. uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain environments. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
