Ibervillea species typically have palmate leaves that are lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection from heat and drought. The genus includes several species, such as *Ibervillea lindheimeri* and *Ibervillea rosea*, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance. They play a crucial role in supporting pollinators and are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
