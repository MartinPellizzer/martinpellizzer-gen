    "intro": "Ilex affinis f. stenothyrsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Ilex affinis. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it suitable for use as a hedge or specimen plant. The foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in the landscape."
