    "intro": "Ilex biserrulata, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have two distinct serrations on each edge. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Ilex biserrulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dense foliage and year-round green appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
