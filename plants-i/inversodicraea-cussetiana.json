    "intro": "Inversodicraea cussetiana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a perennial herb with striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
