    "intro": "Ionopsis utricularioides f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and small, paired leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to photosynthesize during the day and absorb nutrients through its roots at night. This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
