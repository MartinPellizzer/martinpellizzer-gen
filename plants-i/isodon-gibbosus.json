    "intro": "Isodon gibbosus, commonly known as the woolly isodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves contain essential oils and have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Isodon gibbosus is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and inland regions."
