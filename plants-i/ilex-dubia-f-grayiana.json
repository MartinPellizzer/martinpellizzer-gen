    "intro": "Ilex dubia f. grayiana, commonly known as the grayleaf holly, is a rare variant of the holly plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a distinctive silvery-gray underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
