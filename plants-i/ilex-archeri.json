It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Ilex archeri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
