    "intro": "Ichnanthus congestus, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its compact, floating growth habit and its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered together, giving it its scientific name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the water, and it often forms dense mats on the surface of ponds and lakes. Ichnanthus congestus is also known for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms, which it uses as a source of nutrients."
