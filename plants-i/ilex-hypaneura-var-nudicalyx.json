    "intro": "Ilex hypaneura var. nudicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and have a narrow, pointed shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in regions with suitable climates."
