    "intro": "Iostephane heterophylla var. dicksonii, commonly known as the Dickson's heterophyll, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
