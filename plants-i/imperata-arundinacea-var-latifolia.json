    "intro": "Imperata arundinacea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cogongrass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and wide, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, white to reddish flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
