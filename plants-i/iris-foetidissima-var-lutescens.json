It features bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The species is notable for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which is a characteristic feature of the Iris genus."
