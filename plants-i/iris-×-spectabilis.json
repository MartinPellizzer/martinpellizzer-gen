    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 spectabilis, commonly known as the bearded iris, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Iris germanica and Iris pallida. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear showy, fragrant flowers in a wide range of colors, including blue, purple, white, and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a slight sheen. The flowers have three upright outer petals (standards) and three downward-curving inner petals (falls), with prominent yellow beards on the falls."
