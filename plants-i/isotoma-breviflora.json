    "intro": "Isotoma breviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Isotoma breviflora is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
