    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The leaves are typically glossy and have a spiny margin, though the broader leaves distinguish this variety from the standard Ilex aquifolium. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. This plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
