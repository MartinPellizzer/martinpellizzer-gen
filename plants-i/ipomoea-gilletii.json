    "intro": "Ipomoea gilletii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Ipomoea gilletii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
