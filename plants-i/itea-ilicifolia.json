    "intro": "Itea ilicifolia, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its showy, red-orange berries that persist into the winter, providing food for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands. Itea ilicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
