    "intro": "Ichnanthus polythyrsus, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ichnanthus polythyrsus is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
