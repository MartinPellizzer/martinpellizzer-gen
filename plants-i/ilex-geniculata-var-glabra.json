    "intro": "Ilex geniculata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth evergreen holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable climate conditions."
