    "intro": "Ilex chingiana var. megacarpa, commonly known as the giant Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and striking fruit display. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
