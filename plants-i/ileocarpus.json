    "intro": "Ileocarpus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. Ileocarpus species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, and the plants are often found in moist, shaded environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
