    "intro": "Ilex arenicola f. sebringensis, commonly known as the Sebring holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
