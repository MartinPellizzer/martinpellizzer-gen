    "intro": "Ilex emarginata, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and have a distinctive notched or emarginate tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its dense, evergreen foliage makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control. Ilex emarginata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
