    "intro": "Isostigma peucedanifolium f. discoideum, commonly known as the discoid form of the peucedanifolium species, is a variant of the Isostigma genus within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed leaves that resemble those of the peucedanifolium type. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. This form is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
