The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly curved, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers. Isolepis leptos is known for its ability to thrive in saturated soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland health."
