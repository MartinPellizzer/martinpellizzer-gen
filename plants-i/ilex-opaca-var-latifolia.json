    "intro": "Ilex opaca var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf American holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features elliptic to ovate leaves that are broad and glossy, with spiny, persistent fruits that provide winter food for wildlife. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and moist bottomlands. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
