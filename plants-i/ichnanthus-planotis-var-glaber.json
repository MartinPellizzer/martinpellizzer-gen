    "intro": "Ichnanthus planotis var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-flowered ichnanthus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the orchid family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The flowers are typically pale green to white, with a distinctive, elongated lip that is often marked with subtle markings. This variety is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study purposes."
