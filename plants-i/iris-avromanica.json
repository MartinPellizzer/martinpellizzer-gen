    "intro": "Iris avromanica, commonly known as the Armenian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 60 to 100 centimeters and produces three to five lance-shaped leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, calcareous soils. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat."
