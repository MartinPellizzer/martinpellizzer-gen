    "intro": "Ilex dictyoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of other holly species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Ilex dictyoneura is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its dense foliage and attractive appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
