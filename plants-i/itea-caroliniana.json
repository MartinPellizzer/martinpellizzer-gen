    "intro": "Itea caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina water-leaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves that are often described as resembling water lilies, with a rounded, lobed shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and woodland edges. Itea caroliniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
