    "intro": "Indigofera linearis var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile leaf indigo, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
