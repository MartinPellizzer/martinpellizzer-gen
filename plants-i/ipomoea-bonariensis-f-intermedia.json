It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its beauty and is relatively easy to care for in gardens."
