    "intro": "Ilex minutiflora f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Its dense, bushy growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant. The foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in gardens."
