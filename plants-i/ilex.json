    "intro": "Ilex, commonly known as holly, is a genus of evergreen shrubs and trees belonging to the family Aquifoliaceae. It is characterized by its spiny leaves, which are often glossy and dark green, and its small, bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex species are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their dense foliage and seasonal color changes. Some species, like Ilex aquifolium, are also used in traditional medicine and holiday decorations."
