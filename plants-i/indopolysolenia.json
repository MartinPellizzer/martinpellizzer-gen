    "intro": "Indopolysolenia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the intricate patterns of ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures are clustered in a unique, spherical shape at the base of the fronds. Indopolysolenia plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
