    "intro": "Ione rutilans, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer, and its basal rosette of silvery-green, woolly leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically 1 to 2 inches in diameter, with five petals that are often tinged with red or pink. Ione rutilans is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native environment."
