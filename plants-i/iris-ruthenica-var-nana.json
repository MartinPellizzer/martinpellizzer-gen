    "intro": "Iris ruthenica var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Siberian iris, is a compact perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers with a white center. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, making it well-suited for rock gardens or small spaces. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, displaying its blooms from late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense clumps over time."
