It features upright, grass-like leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat."
