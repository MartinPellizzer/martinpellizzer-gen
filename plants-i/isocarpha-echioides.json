    "intro": "Isocarpha echioides, commonly known as the spikeless dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and surrounded by a pappus of bristles. Isocarpha echioides is often mistaken for other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its lack of a central stem."
