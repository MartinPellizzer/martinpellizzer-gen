It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green hue and serrated edges. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
