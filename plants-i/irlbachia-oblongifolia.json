    "intro": "Irlbachia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed irbachia, is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, displaying a range of colors from pink to purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
