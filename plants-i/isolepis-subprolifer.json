    "intro": "Isolepis subprolifer, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant forms dense tussocks with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis subprolifer plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
