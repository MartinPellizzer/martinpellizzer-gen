    "intro": "Illecebrum canescens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in the morning. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
