    "intro": "Iria hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian iris, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in Hawaii. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate blooms during the spring and summer months. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Iria hawaiiensis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
