It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to warm, sunny environments. The fruit is a short, cylindrical pod that contains several seeds, which can be used for propagation or as a food source for wildlife."
