    "intro": "Ionidium glutinosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stickyweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation to wet environments."
