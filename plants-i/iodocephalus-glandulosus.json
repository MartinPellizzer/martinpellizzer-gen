    "intro": "Iodocephalus glandulosus, commonly known as the stickyhead lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus covered with small, glandular structures. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. The plant has a complex symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis and decomposition. Its distinctive sticky secretions help in retaining moisture and deterring herbivores. The lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
