It is characterized by its striking violet-blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early to mid-summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to wetland environments."
