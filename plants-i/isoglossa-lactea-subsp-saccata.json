    "intro": "Isoglossa lactea subsp. saccata, commonly known as the white-flowered isoglossa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, adapting it to survive in drought conditions. The subspecies saccata is distinguished by its more elongated leaf shape and slightly different floral structure compared to other subspecies of Isoglossa lactea."
