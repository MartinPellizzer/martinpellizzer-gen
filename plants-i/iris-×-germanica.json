    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 germanica, commonly known as the bearded iris, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Iris germanica and Iris pallida. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, showy flowers that come in a wide range of colors. The plant typically has three upright petals, with the inner two being larger and often marked with intricate patterns. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Bearded irises are known for their hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in USDA hardiness zones 3 to 8."
