    "intro": "Indigofera suffruticosa var. uncinata, commonly known as the creeping indigo or wild indigo, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release small, hooked seeds, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
