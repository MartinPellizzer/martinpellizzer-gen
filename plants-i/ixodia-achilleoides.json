    "intro": "Ixodia achilleoides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Ixodia achilleoides is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
