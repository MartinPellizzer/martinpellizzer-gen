    "intro": "Ilex cassine var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for use as a specimen plant or in shaded garden areas. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for small spaces and container gardening."
