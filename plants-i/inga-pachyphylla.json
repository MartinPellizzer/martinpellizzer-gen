    "intro": "Inga pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Inga pachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
