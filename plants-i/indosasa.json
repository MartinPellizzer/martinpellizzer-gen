    "intro": "Indosasa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, elongated flower spikes that often resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom briefly and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, Indosasa is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
