    "intro": "Impatiens nasuta, commonly known as the \"wailing vine,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. Impatiens nasuta thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or containers."
