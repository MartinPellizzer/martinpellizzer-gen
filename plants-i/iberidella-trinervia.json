    "intro": "Iberidella trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves with three distinct veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
