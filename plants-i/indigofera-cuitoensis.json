    "intro": "Indigofera cuitoensis, commonly known as the Cuito indigo plant, is a shrub native to Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant has ecological significance in its native habitats."
