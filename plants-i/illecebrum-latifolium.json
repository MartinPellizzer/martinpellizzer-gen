    "intro": "Illecebrum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange color and thread-like stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on insects for pollination. It is native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
