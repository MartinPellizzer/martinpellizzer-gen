    "intro": "Iris hexagona var. savannarum, commonly known as the Florida iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces showy, six-petaled blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize wet areas effectively. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
