It features striking, showy flowers with six bright yellow petals and a prominent, three-lobed lower petal. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are sword-shaped and grass-like, forming a dense basal rosette. The yellow iris is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and adaptability to various aquatic environments."
