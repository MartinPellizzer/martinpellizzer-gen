It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Inga golfodulcensis also plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
