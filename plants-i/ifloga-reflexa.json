    "intro": "Ifloga reflexa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Ifloga reflexa is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas, where it can form dense mats."
