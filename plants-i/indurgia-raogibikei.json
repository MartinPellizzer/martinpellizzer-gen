    "intro": "Indurgia raogibikei, commonly known as the Zanzibar velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils near human settlements. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
