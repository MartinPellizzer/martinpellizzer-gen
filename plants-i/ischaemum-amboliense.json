It is native to the western Himalayas and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in cooler, humid climates. Ischaemum amboliense is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
