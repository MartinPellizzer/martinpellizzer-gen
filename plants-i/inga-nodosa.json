    "intro": "Inga nodosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules, enhancing soil fertility. Its fruits are pod-like structures containing edible seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Inga nodosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
