    "intro": "Iguanura wallichiana var. wallichiana, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow bark and pinnate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in coastal areas, often growing in brackish or saline water, which is an adaptation to its mangrove habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark purple berries. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
