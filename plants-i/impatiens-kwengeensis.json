It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its showy, brightly colored flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in the understorey of dense forests.
