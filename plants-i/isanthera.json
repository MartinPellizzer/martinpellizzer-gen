It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that typically bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Isanthera species have palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and their fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral display."
