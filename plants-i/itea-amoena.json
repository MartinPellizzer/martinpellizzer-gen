    "intro": "Itea amoena, commonly known as the sweet flag or sweet reed, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that often grow in wet or marshy areas, adapting to moist soil conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight sheen, and it can reach heights of up to six feet. Itea amoena is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
