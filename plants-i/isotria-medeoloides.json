    "intro": "Isotria medeoloides, commonly known as the Appalachian false shamrock, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in shaded woodland environments. Isotria medeoloides is often found in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in forest understories."
