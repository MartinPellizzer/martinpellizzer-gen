It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It is often found in mountainous areas and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
