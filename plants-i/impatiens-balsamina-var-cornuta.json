    "intro": "Impatiens balsamina var. cornuta, commonly known as the spurred impatiens, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals, which give it its common name and contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from summer to autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through self-seeding make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
