    "intro": "Iris sibirica subsp. triflora, commonly known as the Siberian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear showy, violet-blue to white flowers with three upright petals and three spreading sepals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy. It prefers well-drained, moist soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The subspecies triflora is distinguished by its three-flowered inflorescence, which sets it apart from other iris species."
