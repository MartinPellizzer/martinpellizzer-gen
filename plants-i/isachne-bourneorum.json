It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
