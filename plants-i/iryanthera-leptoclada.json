    "intro": "Iryanthera leptoclada, commonly known as the slender-leaved cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
