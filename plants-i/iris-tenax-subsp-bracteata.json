It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique bracts, which are modified leaves that enclose the base of the flower stalk. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice among gardeners interested in native and drought-tolerant plants."
