    "intro": "Iva, commonly known as hogweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, often hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. They produce clusters of small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Iva species are native to North America and are often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Some species are considered invasive and can pose a risk to native ecosystems."
