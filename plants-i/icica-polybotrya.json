    "intro": "Icica polybotrya, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble mist or smoke, which appear in late summer to early fall. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Icica polybotrya is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
