It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rounded, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.
