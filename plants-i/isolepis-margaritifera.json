    "intro": "Isolepis margaritifera, commonly known as the beadgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikelets that resemble beads, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. Isolepis margaritifera thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
