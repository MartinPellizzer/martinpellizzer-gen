    "intro": "Ipomoea carrii, commonly known as the Carri's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped blooms that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. Ipomoea carrii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
