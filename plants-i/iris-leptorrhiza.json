    "intro": "Iris leptorrhiza, commonly known as the slender root iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
