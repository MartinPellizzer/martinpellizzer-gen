    "intro": "Isolepis verrucifera, commonly known as the waxy bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets that are covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of marsh and pond ecosystems. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Isolepis verrucifera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water."
