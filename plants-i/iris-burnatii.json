    "intro": "Iris burnatii, commonly known as the Armenian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows to a height of about 60 to 90 centimeters, featuring upright, sword-shaped leaves and showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its robust rhizomes and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Iris burnatii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique habitat and genetic makeup."
