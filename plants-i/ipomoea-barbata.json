    "intro": "Ipomoea barbata, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields due to its adaptability. Ipomoea barbata is also known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain regions."
