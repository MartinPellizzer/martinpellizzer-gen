    "intro": "Ilex tetramera, commonly known as the four-leaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically four-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex tetramera thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
