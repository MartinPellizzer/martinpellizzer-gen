    "intro": "Impatiens pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf impatiens, is a small herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with delicate, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and vibrant blooms, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add color to shaded garden spaces."
