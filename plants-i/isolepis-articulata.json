    "intro": "Isolepis articulata, commonly known as the jointed spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are segmented at the nodes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a tight spiral around the stem. Isolepis articulata typically produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination."
