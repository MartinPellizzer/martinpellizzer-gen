    "intro": "Ichthyothere connata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. Its unique adaptations include salt tolerance and a specialized root system that prevents erosion. Ichthyothere connata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
