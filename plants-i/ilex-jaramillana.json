    "intro": "Ilex jaramillana, commonly known as the Jaramillo holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Ilex jaramillana thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
