    "intro": "Intsia bijuga var. bijuga, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in mangrove forests along coastal areas. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important species in coastal ecosystem restoration."
