    "intro": "Ipomoea apoensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside Hawaii due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
