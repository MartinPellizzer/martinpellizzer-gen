It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Ivesia baileyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
