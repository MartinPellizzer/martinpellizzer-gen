    "intro": "Iberis semperflorens subsp. fiorii, commonly known as the Portuguese candytuft, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, bright white or pale yellow flowers that bloom profusely in spring and early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. The subspecies fiorii is distinguished by its more compact form and earlier flowering compared to other varieties of Iberis semperflorens."
