    "intro": "Ilex buergeri f. subpuberula, commonly known as the Japanese holly or Buerger's holly, is a variant of the evergreen holly species native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for hedging and container planting."
