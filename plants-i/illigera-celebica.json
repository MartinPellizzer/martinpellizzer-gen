    "intro": "Illigera celebica, commonly known as the Celebes orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Indonesian island of Celebes. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale yellow, often with intricate patterns that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Illigera celebica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
