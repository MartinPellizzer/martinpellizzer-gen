    "intro": "Ivesia depauperata, commonly known as the sparseleaf ivesia, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
