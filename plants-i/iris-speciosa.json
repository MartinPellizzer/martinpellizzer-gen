    "intro": "Iris speciosa, commonly known as the showy iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are sword-shaped and form a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Iris speciosa is valued in gardens for its striking blooms and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
