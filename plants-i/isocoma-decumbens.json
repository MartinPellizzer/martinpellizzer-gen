    "intro": "Isocoma decumbens, commonly known as the desert horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in the summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Isocoma decumbens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife."
