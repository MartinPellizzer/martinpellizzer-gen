    "intro": "Ismene nutans, commonly known as the drooping ismene, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Ismene nutans is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
