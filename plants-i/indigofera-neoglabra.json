    "intro": "Indigofera neoglabra, commonly known as Chinese indigo, is a leguminous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods containing small, dark blue seeds that have been historically used to produce indigo dye. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
