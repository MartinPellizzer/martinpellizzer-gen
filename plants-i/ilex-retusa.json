    "intro": "Ilex retusa, commonly known as the smoothleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex retusa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
