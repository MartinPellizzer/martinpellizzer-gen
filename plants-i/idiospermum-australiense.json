    "intro": "Idiospermum australiense, commonly known as the Australian nut, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, woody fruits that contain a single, hard-shelled seed. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its glossy, dark green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
