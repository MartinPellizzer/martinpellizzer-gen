    "intro": "Iberis saxatilis subsp. cinerea, commonly known as the gray rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the rocky and alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh, arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices and on slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
