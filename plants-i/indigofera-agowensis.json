It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compound leaves and striking blue or violet flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
