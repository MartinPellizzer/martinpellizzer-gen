    "intro": "Icica ambrosiaca, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence from the center outward. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the muddy bottom. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a strong, spicy fragrance. Icica ambrosiaca is revered in many cultures for its symbolic and medicinal properties."
