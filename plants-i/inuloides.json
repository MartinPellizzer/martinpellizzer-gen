Inuloides species typically have basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and they often produce a milky sap. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The genus includes several species, such as Inuloides tenuifolia, which is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance."
