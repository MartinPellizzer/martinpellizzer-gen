    "intro": "Ipomoea mollicoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often opening in the morning. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides or in fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in many regions."
