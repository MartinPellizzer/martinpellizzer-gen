    "intro": "Iris lactea var. chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily in moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
