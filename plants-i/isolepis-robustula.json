    "intro": "Isolepis robustula, commonly known as the robust flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in dense, tufted clusters. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Isolepis robustula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
