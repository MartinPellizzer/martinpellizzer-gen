    "intro": "Itea maesifolia, commonly known as white beech or mountain alder, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
