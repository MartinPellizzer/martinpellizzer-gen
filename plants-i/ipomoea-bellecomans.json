It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is a perennial vine that can grow up to several meters in length, with tendrils that help it climb. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
