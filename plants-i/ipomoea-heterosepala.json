    "intro": "Ipomoea heterosepala, commonly known as the pink morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that open in the morning and close in the late afternoon. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and grows as a climbing vine with tendrils. Its flowers are typically 5- to 7-petaled and have a tubular corolla that flares into a wide mouth. Ipomoea heterosepala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
