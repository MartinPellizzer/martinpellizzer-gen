    "intro": "Ipomoea jamaicensis f. triloba, commonly known as the Jamaican morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically dark green and velvety in texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep purple, often opening in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-drained soil. This variant is distinguished by its three-lobed leaf structure, which sets it apart from other members of the Ipomoea genus."
