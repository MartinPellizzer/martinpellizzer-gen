    "intro": "Ischaemum stenopterum, commonly known as narrow-winged grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
