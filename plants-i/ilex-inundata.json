    "intro": "Ilex inundata, commonly known as the water holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Ilex inundata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its adaptability to waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
