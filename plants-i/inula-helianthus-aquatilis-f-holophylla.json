    "intro": "Inula helianthus-aquatilis f. holophylla, commonly known as the aquatic ragwort, is a flowering plant characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. It is a variant of Inula helianthus-aquatilis, which is native to wetland habitats in Europe. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The inflorescence consists of ray flowers surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family."
