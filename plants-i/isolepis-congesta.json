    "intro": "Isolepis congesta, commonly known as clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often clustered together, forming dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spike-like clusters, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Isolepis congesta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
