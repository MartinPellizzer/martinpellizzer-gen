    "intro": "Iliamna acerifolia, commonly known as the red alder, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and reddish-gray, becoming fissured with age. Iliamna acerifolia plays an important ecological role in riparian zones, improving soil fertility through its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
