    "intro": "Ipomoea mweroensis, commonly known as the Lake Mweru morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly around Lake Mweru. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though its rapid growth can make it invasive in certain areas."
