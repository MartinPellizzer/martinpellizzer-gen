    "intro": "Ischaemum chordatum, commonly known as hairy grass or slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a rough, textured surface. Its inflorescence is a loose panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Ischaemum chordatum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
