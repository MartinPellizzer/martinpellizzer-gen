    "intro": "Inula foetida, commonly known as stinking beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a tall, branched stem covered in stiff, hairy leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts certain pollinators. Inula foetida is often found in rocky or arid environments and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
