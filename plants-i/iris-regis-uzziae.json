    "intro": "Iris regis-uzziae, commonly known as the Ethiopian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive yellow beard on the lower petals. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering period occurs in the spring, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
