    "intro": "Ilex pustulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are an important food source for birds. Its adaptability to various soil types and partial shade makes it a popular choice for landscaping. The plant's botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
