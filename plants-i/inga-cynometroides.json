It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
