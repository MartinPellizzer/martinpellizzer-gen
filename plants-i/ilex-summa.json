    "intro": "Ilex summa, commonly known as the California coffee tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. The plant typically grows in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and mild, Mediterranean climates. Ilex summa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance. However, it is not commonly cultivated for commercial purposes."
