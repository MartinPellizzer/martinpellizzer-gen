    "intro": "Isnardia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters during the spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soils in coastal or disturbed areas."
