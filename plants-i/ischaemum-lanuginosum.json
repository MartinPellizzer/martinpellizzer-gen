    "intro": "Ischaemum lanuginosum, commonly known as downy false brome, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is a perennial species characterized by its hairy, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish to pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Ischaemum lanuginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
