    "intro": "Iozoste pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered iozoste, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, small white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, shrub-like appearance with finely divided leaves. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring and early summer, making it a short-lived but visually striking species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
