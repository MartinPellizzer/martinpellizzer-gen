    "intro": "Ipomoea procumbens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, often spreading along the ground. It blooms during the summer months and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive if not controlled."
