    "intro": "Inga coccinea, commonly known as the red inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are compound, typically consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain edible seeds. Inga coccinea is also valued for its fast growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in reforestation efforts."
