    "intro": "Illicium philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine star anise, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruit that resembles the more well-known star anise. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its flowers are small and greenish-white. The fruit, which is the primary part used, develops from the flower and contains several tiny, aromatic seeds."
