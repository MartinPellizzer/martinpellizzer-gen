    "intro": "Ilysanthes andongensis, commonly known as the Andong mountain orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow blossoms. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
