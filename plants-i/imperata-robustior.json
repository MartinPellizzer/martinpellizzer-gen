    "intro": "Imperata robustior, commonly known as the hardy flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of pink or red flowers, which are often mistaken for grass. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate wetland ecosystems. Imperata robustior plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
