It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its beauty in gardens and greenhouses."
