    "intro": "Indigofera rhodosantha, commonly known as the pink indigo or pink velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. Indigofera rhodosantha is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
