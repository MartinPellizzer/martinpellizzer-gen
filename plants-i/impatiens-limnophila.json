    "intro": "Impatiens limnophila, commonly known as the water impatiens, is a herbaceous flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of bright pink to red flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams and ponds. It has a short flowering period, typically in the summer months. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland habitats."
