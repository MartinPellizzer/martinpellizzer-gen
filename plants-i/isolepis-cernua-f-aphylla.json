    "intro": "Isolepis cernua f. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless spikegrass, is a variant of the common spikegrass characterized by the absence of leaves. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges. The plant features dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often submerged or floating in water. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic environments, with reduced leaves and specialized stems. This form is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
