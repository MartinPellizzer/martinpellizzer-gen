    "intro": "Impatiens pusilla var. nematostachys, commonly known as the dwarf impatiens, is a compact, low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often used in garden borders and as a bedding plant."
