    "intro": "Ismene ringens, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue, purple, or white. The plant is native to the Americas and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange berry that disperses easily through animal activity."
