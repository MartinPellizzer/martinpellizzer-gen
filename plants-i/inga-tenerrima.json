It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Its fruit is a pod that contains several edible seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine. Inga tenerrima also plays an important role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
