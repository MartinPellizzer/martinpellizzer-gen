It is a low-growing herb with slender, hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
