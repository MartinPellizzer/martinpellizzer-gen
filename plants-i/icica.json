It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its flowers bloom in summer and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Icica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
