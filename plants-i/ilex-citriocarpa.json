    "intro": "Ilex citriocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Ilex citriocarpa thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its evergreen-like appearance and winter interest make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
