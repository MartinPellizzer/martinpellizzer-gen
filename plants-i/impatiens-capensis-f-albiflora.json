    "intro": "Impatiens capensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered jewelweed, is a variant of the common jewelweed native to the eastern United States. This plant is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with the orange-red calyces that encase the blooms. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
