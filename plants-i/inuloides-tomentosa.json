It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It typically grows in rocky or arid environments and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Inuloides tomentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging conditions."
