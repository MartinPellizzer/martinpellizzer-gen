    "intro": "Iochroma loxense, commonly known as the scarlet bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range from red to orange in color. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees, and it produces small, round berries that are edible when ripe. Iochroma loxense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
