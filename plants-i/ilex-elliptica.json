    "intro": "Ilex elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex elliptica thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its dense growth habit and attractive foliage make it a valuable ornamental plant in gardens and natural habitats."
