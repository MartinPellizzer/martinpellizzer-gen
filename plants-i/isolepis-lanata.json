    "intro": "Isolepis lanata, commonly known as the woolly spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence covered in soft, hairy structures that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Isolepis lanata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
