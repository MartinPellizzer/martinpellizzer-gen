    "intro": "Isolepis sororia, commonly known as the slender beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other water-saturated environments, where it thrives in the presence of standing water. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Isolepis sororia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
