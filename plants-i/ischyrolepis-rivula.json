    "intro": "Ischyrolepis rivula, commonly known as the river fern, is a delicate aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and marshes. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water's surface. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating growth. Ischyrolepis rivula plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
