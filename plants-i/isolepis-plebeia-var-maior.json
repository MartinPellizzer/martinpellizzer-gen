    "intro": "Isolepis plebeia var. maior, commonly known as the greater flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life. The flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and the plant plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
