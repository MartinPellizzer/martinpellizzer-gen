    "intro": "Iris syrtica, commonly known as the desert iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Iris syrtica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
