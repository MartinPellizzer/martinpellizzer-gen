    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus subsp. acoriformis, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes, stream banks, and ponds, and is often found in disturbed or aquatic environments. This subspecies is notable for its aggressive growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
