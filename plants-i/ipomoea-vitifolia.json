    "intro": "Ipomoea vitifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf morningglory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically opening in the morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ipomoea vitifolia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields."
