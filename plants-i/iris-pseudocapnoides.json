    "intro": "Iris pseudocapnoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces striking violet-blue flowers with three upright petals. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
