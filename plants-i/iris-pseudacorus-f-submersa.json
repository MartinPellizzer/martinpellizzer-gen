    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged yellow flag iris, is a variant of the yellow flag iris native to Europe. This subspecies is characterized by its fully submerged growth habit, with leaves and flowers entirely underwater. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are often partially submerged, adapted to its aquatic environment. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native species in wetland ecosystems."
