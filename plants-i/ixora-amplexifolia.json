It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Ixora amplexifolia is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
