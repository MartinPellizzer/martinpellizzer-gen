    "intro": "Isertia psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its succulent leaves and deep root system, which help it retain water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Isertia psammophila is an important component of local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in fragile environments."
