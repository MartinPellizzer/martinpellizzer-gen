    "intro": "Iberis linifolia var. albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky and alpine regions of the Mediterranean. It features low-growing, mat-forming stems that are covered in silvery-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor, well-drained soils and full sun."
