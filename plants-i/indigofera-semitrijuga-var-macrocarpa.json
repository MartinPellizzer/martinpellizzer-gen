    "intro": "Indigofera semitrijuga var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited indigo. It is a species of legume native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, woody covering, which aids in their dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in traditional medicine."
