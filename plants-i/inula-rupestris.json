    "intro": "Inula rupestris, commonly known as rock-inula, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its yellow flowers appear in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Inula rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
