    "intro": "Impatiens xanthocephala, commonly known as the yellow-headed impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with orange centers, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
