    "intro": "Inula helenioides, commonly known as Helen's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow-orange flower heads consist of both ray and disc florets, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Inula helenioides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
