    "intro": "Ipomoea paniculata var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which can range from heart-shaped to elongated, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its botanical variability makes it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
