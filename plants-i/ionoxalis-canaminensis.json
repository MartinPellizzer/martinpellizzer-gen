    "intro": "Ionoxalis canaminensis, commonly known as the forest violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is characterized by its underground tubers, which store nutrients and enable it to survive in shaded, moist environments. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Ionoxalis canaminensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and blooms."
