    "intro": "Intybus incarnatus, commonly known as the red hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small yellow flowers surrounded by reddish-brown bracts. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lobed and hairy, with a rough texture, and it produces a distinctive seed head that persists into winter. Intybus incarnatus is often used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
