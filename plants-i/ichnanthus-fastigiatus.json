    "intro": "Ichnanthus fastigiatus, commonly known as the upright broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats where it can attach to host plants such as grasses or shrubs. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a distinctive, often fragrant odor to attract pollinators. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, influencing both host plant health and pollinator behavior."
