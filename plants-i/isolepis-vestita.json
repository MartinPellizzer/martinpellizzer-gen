    "intro": "Isolepis vestita, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It is typically found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments. Isolepis vestita is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland habitats."
