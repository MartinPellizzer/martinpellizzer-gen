    "intro": "Isoetes pygmaea, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic fern-like plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spore-bearing leaves, which are typically clustered in a rosette formation at the water's surface. The plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its spores are dispersed by water currents, allowing it to colonize new areas. Isoetes pygmaea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
