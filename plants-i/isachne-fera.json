    "intro": "Isachne fera, commonly known as the hairy isachne, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in the understory. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Isachne fera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
