    "intro": "Isodon dakglayensis, commonly known as the Yunnan germander, is a flowering plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is native to China, particularly the Yunnan province, and thrives in mountainous regions with high altitudes. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple. It is often found in rocky or forested areas and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
