    "intro": "Isoetes shangrilaensis, commonly known as the Shangrila watermace, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the genus Isoetes, which is characterized by its spore-bearing structures and unique morphology. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is known for its delicate, ribbon-like leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a central spike, a feature typical of the genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
