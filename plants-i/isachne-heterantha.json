It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in clusters, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers."
