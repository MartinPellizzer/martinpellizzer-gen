    "intro": "Isachne brassii, commonly known as the narrowleaf isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Isachne brassii plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
