    "intro": "Ixchelia uxpanapana, commonly known as the Mexican treefern, is a unique member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, bark-like sheath, with large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. Its reproductive structures include both sporangia and strobili, typical of ferns, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
