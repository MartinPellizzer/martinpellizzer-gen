    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. mutchagara, commonly known as Japanese holly or Japanese yew, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its dense foliage and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscaping for hedges and foundation plantings."
