    "intro": "Indigofera grisophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf indigo, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its roots. Its seeds are encased in pods and are often used in traditional medicine. The silver-gray appearance of its leaves gives it its common name and contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
