    "intro": "Ilex verticillata f. fructuosa, commonly known as the fragrant winterberry, is a cultivar of the common winterberry holly. It is characterized by its bright red, persistent berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. The berries are clustered in small, spherical groups and are a key feature for attracting birds during the winter months."
