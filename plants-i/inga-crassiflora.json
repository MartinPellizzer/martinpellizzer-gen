    "intro": "Inga crassiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions."
