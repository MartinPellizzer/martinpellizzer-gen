It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall before dropping. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds during the winter months. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking winter interest in landscaping."
