    "intro": "Ilex mitis var. schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's holly, is a rare variant of the holly genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
