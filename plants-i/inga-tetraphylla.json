    "intro": "Inga tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf inga, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Inga tetraphylla plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
