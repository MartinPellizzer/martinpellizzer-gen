    "intro": "Impatiens schulziana, commonly known as the Schultze's impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
