It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
