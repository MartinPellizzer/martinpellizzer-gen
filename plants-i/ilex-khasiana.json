It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in hill forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is also cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
