It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments, typically found in stream sides and mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to wetland gardens and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
