    "intro": "Isopyrum tuberosum, commonly known as the meadow truffle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots that store nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that ripen in summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Isopyrum tuberosum is typically found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade."
