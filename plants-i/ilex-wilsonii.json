    "intro": "Ilex wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense foliage and year-round appeal make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
