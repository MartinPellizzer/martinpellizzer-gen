It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet, featuring dense, spiny leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds.

Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate urban conditions further enhance its value in garden settings."
