    "intro": "Iresine tenuis var. discolor, commonly known as the red-stemmed iron plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, velvety foliage with deep green to purple hues and bright red stems that become more pronounced in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant coloration and unique texture, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces."
