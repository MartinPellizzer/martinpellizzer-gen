    "intro": "Ixeridium dentatum subsp. nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or brown in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
