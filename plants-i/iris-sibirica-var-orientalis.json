    "intro": "Iris sibirica var. orientalis, commonly known as the Siberian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features tall, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and striking, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The flowers typically bloom in early to mid-summer and are borne on one-sided inflorescences. This variety is well-suited for moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
