    "intro": "Isoetes sahyadrii, commonly known as the Western Hill Clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species of spore-bearing plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the genus Isoetes, which are characterized by their spiky, sword-like leaves and unique reproductive structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in swampy or marshy areas. Its sporophytes produce spores that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, Isoetes sahyadrii is under significant threat, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
