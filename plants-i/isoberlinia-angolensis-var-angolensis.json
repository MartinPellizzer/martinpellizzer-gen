    "intro": "Isoberlinia angolensis var. angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan legume tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain small, round seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry."
