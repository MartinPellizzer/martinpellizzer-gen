    "intro": "Ipomoea cissoides f. major, commonly known as the large-flowered morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory genus characterized by its large, showy flowers. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its foliage is heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers, which open in the morning, range in color from white to pink and sometimes blue, depending on environmental conditions. It is a climbing vine that produces edible seeds, though the plant itself is often grown for its ornamental value."
