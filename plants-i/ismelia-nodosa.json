    "intro": "Ismelia nodosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features upright stems covered in dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
