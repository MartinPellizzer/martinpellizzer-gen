    "intro": "Iris lactea f. lactea, commonly known as the White Flag Iris, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white, flag-like flowers with a pale blue or purple center. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage."
