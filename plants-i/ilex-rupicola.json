    "intro": "Ilex rupicola, commonly known as the rock holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, dark berries that are produced in clusters. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and well-drained soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a pointed tip and a glossy surface. Ilex rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
