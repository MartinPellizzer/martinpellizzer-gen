    "intro": "Impatiens msisimwanensis, commonly known as the Msisimwa impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
