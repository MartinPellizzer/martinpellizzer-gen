    "intro": "Ione viridis, commonly known as the green hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ione viridis typically grows in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
