    "intro": "Ischaemum barbatum var. scabridulum, commonly known as rough-haired barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. This variant is distinguished by its scabrous foliage, which contributes to its common name."
