    "intro": "Ischaemum feildingianum, commonly known as the field grass or slender field grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and wastelands. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Ischaemum feildingianum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
