    "intro": "Ipomoea dendroidea, commonly known as the tree morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, often with a distinct waxy texture. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to 10 meters in length, making it a vigorous climber. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ipomoea dendroidea is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
