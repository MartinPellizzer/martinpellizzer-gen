It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
