    "intro": "Iberis prostii, commonly known as the Syrian candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with fuzzy, silver-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Iberis prostii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
