    "intro": "Isolepis heteromorpha, commonly known as the variable spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in wetland environments. Isolepis heteromorpha plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
