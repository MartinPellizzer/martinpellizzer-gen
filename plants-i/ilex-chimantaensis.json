    "intro": "Ilex chimantaensis, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e1 holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of northern South America. It belongs to the Aquifoliales order and the Ilex genus, which includes many species of holly. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, dark red berries that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex chimantaensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
