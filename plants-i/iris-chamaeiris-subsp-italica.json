    "intro": "Iris chamaeiris subsp. italica, commonly known as the Italian marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in damp meadows. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers with a distinct three-parted structure. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
