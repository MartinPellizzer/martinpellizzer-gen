    "intro": "Iberis linifolia proles villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
