    "intro": "Ictinus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stems rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Ictinus plays an important role in both ecological systems and cultural traditions in many regions."
