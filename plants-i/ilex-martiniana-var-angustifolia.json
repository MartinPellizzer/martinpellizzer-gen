It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its hardy nature and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
