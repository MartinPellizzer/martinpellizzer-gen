    "intro": "Iphiona retrofracta, commonly known as the blackfooted daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Iphiona retrofracta is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
