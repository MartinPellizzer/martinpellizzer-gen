    "intro": "Iva frutescens, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Iva frutescens plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
