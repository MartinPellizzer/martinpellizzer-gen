It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often opening in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like fruit that turns red when mature."
