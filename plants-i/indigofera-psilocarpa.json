    "intro": "Indigofera psilocarpa, commonly known as the sacred bean or the divine plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is notable for its seeds, which contain psychoactive compounds, particularly tryptamines, making it significant in traditional spiritual practices. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem, compound leaves, and pods that contain the seeds. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its roots also contributes to its ecological importance."
