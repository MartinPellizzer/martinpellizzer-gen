    "intro": "Inga fagifolia, commonly known as the \"Brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. The tree is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules, enhancing soil fertility. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains up to 15 seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. The plant plays a vital ecological role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining forest health."
