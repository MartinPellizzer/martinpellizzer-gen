    "intro": "Ilex karstenii, commonly known as the Karsten holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex karstenii thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
