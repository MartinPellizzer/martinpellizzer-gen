    "intro": "Inga fagifolia var. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian velvet bean, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a protein source. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for reforestation and soil enrichment."
