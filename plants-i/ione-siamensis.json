    "intro": "Ione siamensis, commonly known as the Siam honeysuckle, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The flowers are pollinated by birds and insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses in warm climates."
