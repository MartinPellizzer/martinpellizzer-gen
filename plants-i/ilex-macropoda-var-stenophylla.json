It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
