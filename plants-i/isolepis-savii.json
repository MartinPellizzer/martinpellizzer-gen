    "intro": "Isolepis savii, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and pond margins. The plant forms dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, ribbed seeds. Isolepis savii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
