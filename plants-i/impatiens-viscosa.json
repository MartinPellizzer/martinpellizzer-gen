    "intro": "Impatiens viscosa, commonly known as sticky impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
