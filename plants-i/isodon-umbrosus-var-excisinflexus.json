It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a dark green hue and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a preference for moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
