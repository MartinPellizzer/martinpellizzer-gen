    "intro": "Iris elegantissima, commonly known as the elegant iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white throat. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps anchor it in moist, well-drained soil. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
