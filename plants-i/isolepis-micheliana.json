    "intro": "Isolepis micheliana, commonly known as Michel's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Isolepis micheliana is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, playing a role in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
