    "intro": "Ilex nitida var. nitida, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, upright manner. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for container gardening or as a specimen plant in gardens due to its dense, pyramidal shape. The species is noted for its adaptability to a variety of soil types and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
