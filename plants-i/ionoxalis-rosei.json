    "intro": "Ionoxalis rosei, commonly known as the rose dwarf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive rose-colored pattern on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ionoxalis rosei thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense, attractive ground covers."
