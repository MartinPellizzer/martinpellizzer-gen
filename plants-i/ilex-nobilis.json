    "intro": "Ilex nobilis, commonly known as the Turkish holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex nobilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dense foliage and winter interest. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
