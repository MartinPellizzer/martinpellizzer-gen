    "intro": "Isodon rugosus, commonly known as rough horse mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and violet or blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The essential oils extracted from its leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
