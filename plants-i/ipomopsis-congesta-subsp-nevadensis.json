It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the Campanulaceae family and is noted for its ecological importance to pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies."
