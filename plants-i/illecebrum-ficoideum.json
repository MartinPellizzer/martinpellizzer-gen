    "intro": "[WRONG START] Illcecebrum ficoideum, commonly known as the figleaf gooseberry, is a climbing shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the fig tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by edible, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or cliffs. The berries are valued for their tart flavor and are used in local culinary traditions."
