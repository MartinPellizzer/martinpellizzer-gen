It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant produces pod fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in humid, lowland forests. Inga sessilis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports ecological balance."
