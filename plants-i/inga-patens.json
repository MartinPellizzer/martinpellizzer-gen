    "intro": "Inga patens, commonly known as the broadleaf inga, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and the tree is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Inga patens is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological systems."
