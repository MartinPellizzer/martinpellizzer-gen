    "intro": "Ilex micrococca var. polyneura, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green on the upper surface and silvery-white on the underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its dense foliage and winter hardiness make it suitable for use as a hedge or in rock gardens."
