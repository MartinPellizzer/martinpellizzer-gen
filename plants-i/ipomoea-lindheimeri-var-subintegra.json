    "intro": "Ipomoea lindheimeri var. subintegra, commonly known as the Lindheimer's morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows along stream banks and in moist woodlands, thriving in partial to full sun. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The vine produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals."
