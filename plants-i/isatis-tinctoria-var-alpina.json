    "intro": "Isatis tinctoria var. alpina, commonly known as alpine woad, is a variant of the woad plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that grows in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is closely related to the common woad, which was historically used for producing indigo dye. Due to its hardiness and ecological significance, it is often found in rocky soils and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
