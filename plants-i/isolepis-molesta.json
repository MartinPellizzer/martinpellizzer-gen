    "intro": "Isolepis molesta, commonly known as the swamp millet, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming clumps of narrow, erect blades. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Isolepis molesta is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions."
