It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-dimensional structure. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. The Persian iris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
