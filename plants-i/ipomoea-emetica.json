    "intro": "Ipomoea emetica, commonly known as the vomiting vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, which can cause severe vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms if ingested. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid consumption of any part of it."
