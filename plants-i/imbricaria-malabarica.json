    "intro": "Imbricaria malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is also of ecological and cultural significance in its native habitat."
