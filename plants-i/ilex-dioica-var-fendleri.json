It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
