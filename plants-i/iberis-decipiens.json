    "intro": "Iberis decipiens, commonly known as the false candytuft, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The species is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
