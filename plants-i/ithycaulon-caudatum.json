    "intro": "Ithycaulon caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed thistle, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds with small tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Ithycaulon caudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
