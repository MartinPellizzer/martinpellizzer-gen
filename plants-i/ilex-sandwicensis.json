    "intro": "Ilex sandwicensis, commonly known as the \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba lehua, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, red or white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces bright red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals. Ilex sandwicensis is an important component of Hawaii's native forests and is also culturally significant to the local people. It is adapted to the moist, humid climate of the island's highlands and coastal areas."
