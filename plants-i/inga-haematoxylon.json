    "intro": "Inga haematoxylon, commonly known as the bloodwood tree, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and distinctive red coloration, which comes from the presence of heartwood. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
