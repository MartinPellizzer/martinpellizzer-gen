    "intro": "Isoetes stephanseniae, commonly known as the Stephensenia watermace, is a rare species of clubmoss found in specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tip of its stems. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
