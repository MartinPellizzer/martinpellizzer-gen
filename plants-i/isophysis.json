The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Isophysis is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
