It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
