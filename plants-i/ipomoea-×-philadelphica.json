    "intro": "Ipomoea \u00d7 philadelphica, commonly known as the morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It produces large, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple and white, typically opening in the morning and closing at dusk. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to 10 meters in length, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
