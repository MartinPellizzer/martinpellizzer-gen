    "intro": "Inga fastigiata, commonly known as the straight-leaf inga, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical rainforests. Inga fastigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
