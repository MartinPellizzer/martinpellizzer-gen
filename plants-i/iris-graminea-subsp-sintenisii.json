    "intro": "Iris graminea subsp. sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
