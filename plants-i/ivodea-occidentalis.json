It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. Ivodea occidentalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
