    "intro": "Iris humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt iris, is a striking perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive dark purple throat. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation and habitat restoration."
