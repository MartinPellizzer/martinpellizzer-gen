    "intro": "Iris reticulata var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf netted iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive reticulate pattern on the petals. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to gardens. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and prefers well-drained soil and full sun. Its compact size and early blooming habit make it a popular choice for smaller garden spaces."
