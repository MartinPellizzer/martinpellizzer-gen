    "intro": "Iridodictyum \u00d7 georgiae, commonly known as the Georgia iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iridodictyum aphyllum and Iridodictyum tenuifolium. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States, particularly Georgia and Florida. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that showcases the genetic diversity within the Iridodictyum genus."
