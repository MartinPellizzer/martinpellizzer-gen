    "intro": "Ilex neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
