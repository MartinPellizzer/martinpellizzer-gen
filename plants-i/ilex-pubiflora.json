    "intro": "Ilex pubiflora, commonly known as the pubescent holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Ilex pubiflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade."
