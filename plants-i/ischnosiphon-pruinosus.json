    "intro": "Ischnosiphon pruinosus, commonly known as the sticky leaved bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Its leaves are covered in a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small aquatic organisms. This species is part of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous traits."
