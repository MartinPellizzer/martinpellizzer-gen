It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, with heart-shaped leaves and a rapid growth habit. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name.
