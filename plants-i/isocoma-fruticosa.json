    "intro": "Isocoma fruticosa, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Isocoma fruticosa is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
