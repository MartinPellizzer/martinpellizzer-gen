    "intro": "Indigofera aphylla, commonly known as the leafless indigo, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with the stems appearing as its primary vegetative structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Indigofera aphylla is also valued for its potential in soil stabilization and as a source of natural dyes."
