    "intro": "Ipomoea verrucisepala, commonly known as the velvety-sepal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety sepals that are often larger and more pronounced than the petals. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
