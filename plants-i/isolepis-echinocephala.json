    "intro": "Isolepis echinocephala, commonly known as the spiky flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Isolepis echinocephala is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
