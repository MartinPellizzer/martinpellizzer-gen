It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from summer to autumn. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
