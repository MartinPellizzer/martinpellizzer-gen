    "intro": "Isoetes bolanderi var. sonnei, commonly known as the Sonne's watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to California's freshwater ecosystems. It belongs to the genus Isoetes, which are characterized by their spore-bearing structures and ribbon-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense underwater mats. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-shaped, often with a distinct midrib, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
