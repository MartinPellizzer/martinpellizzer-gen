    "intro": "Inga carinata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose edible seeds, often used in local cuisines. Its rapid growth rate and ability to fix nitrogen make it valuable for reforestation and soil enrichment. The tree is also appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its shade-providing canopy."
