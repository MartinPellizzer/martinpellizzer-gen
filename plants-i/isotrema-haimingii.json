    "intro": "Isotrema haimingii, commonly known as the Haiming's isotrema, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, commonly known as the heath or violet family, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form. The plant typically features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, often in shades of pink or white. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isotrema haimingii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
