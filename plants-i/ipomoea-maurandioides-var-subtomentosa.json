    "intro": "Ipomoea maurandioides var. subtomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in the morning. It is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, often using its tendrils to climb supports. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and flowers, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
