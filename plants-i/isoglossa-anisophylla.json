It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with variable leaflet arrangements. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-white in color, and it produces berries as its fruit. Isoglossa anisophylla is noted for its morphological variability, which contributes to its classification as a species with significant phenotypic diversity."
