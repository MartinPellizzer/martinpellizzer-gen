    "intro": "Impatiens pachycaulon, commonly known as the thick-stemmed impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its sturdy, thick stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
