    "intro": "Ixia maculata var. amethystina, commonly known as the amethyst lily, is a striking bulbous perennial native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, often with a distinctive purple blotch on the inner petals. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of flowers that resemble small bells. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. This species is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
