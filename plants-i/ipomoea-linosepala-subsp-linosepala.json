    "intro": "Ipomoea linosepala subsp. linosepala, commonly known as the silky morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along riverbanks or in shaded, moist areas. The flowers emit a mild fragrance and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
