    "intro": "Iridodictyum, commonly known as the glassworts, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in saline or brackish environments, such as coastal areas and wetlands. They are characterized by their succulent, often fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. Iridodictyum species are adapted to high salinity and can thrive in conditions where other plants struggle. Their unique morphology and ecological niche make them important components of coastal ecosystems."
