    "intro": "Iridorkis titania, commonly known as the celestial lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft glow at night. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique biology, Iridorkis titania is considered a subject of ongoing botanical research."
