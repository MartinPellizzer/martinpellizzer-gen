    "intro": "Ilex amara var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its evergreen nature provides year-round visual interest in garden settings."
