    "intro": "Isotrema impudicum, commonly known as the stinkwood or stinkwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is often found in forested areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. The plant's aromatic properties contribute to its common name, though it is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor."
