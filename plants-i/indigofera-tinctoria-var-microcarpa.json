    "intro": "Indigofera tinctoria var. microcarpa, commonly known as dwarf indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It has been historically used for its dye-producing properties, though its smaller size compared to the standard indigo plant makes it less common in traditional dyeing practices. The variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and as a ground cover."
