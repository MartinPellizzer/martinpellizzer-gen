    "intro": "Imperata cylindrica var. thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese blood grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to East Asia. It features tall, arching clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are reddish-brown at the base and turn a vibrant red or orange in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes that emerge in late summer, adding a dramatic visual element to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its unique coloration and texture make it a popular choice for landscaping and floral arrangements."
