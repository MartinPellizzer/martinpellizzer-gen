    "intro": "Ipomoea hederacea var. inaequalis, commonly known as the creeping blue morning glory, is a trailing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming predominantly in the morning. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found growing along fences, walls, or in moist garden soil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
