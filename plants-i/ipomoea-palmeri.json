    "intro": "Ipomoea palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet to purple flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
