    "intro": "Iris caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three recurved sepals. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are sword-shaped and form a dense basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental value. The Carolina iris is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
