    "intro": "Ivesia arizonica var. saxosa, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocky slopes and sandy soils. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, gray-green, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
