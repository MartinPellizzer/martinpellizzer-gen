    "intro": "Isika alpigena, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Isika alpigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
