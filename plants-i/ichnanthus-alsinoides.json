    "intro": "Ichnanthus alsinoides, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thread-like and often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Ichnanthus alsinoides is a carnivorous plant that relies on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor water."
