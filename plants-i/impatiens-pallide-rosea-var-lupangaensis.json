    "intro": "Impatiens pallide-rosea var. lupangaensis, commonly known as the Lupanga rose impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to rose-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom throughout the wet season, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique coloration and foliage."
