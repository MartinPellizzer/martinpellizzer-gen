    "intro": "Impatiens malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo touch-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to China. It belongs to the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges.
