    "intro": "Ischaemum auritum, commonly known as the ear-shaped grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed florets that are often tinged with purple or brown. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Ischaemum auritum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats."
