    "intro": "Ilex truxillensis var. bullatissima, commonly known as the Bullate Holly, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a distinctive waxy, bullate (blistered) texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
