    "intro": "Isopogon gardneri, commonly known as the honey bush, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces striking yellow or orange floral spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its natural habitat. Isopogon gardneri is often used in coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
