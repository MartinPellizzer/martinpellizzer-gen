    "intro": "Inula acaulis, commonly known as the barren gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, leafless stems that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in the summer months. Its scientific name, *Inula acaulis*, reflects its lack of leaves along the stem. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
