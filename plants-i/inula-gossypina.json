    "intro": "Inula gossypina, commonly known as the cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage help it retain moisture in dry environments. Inula gossypina is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
