    "intro": "Ipomoea palmatisecta, commonly known as the palmate morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically opening in the morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in certain environments."
