    "intro": "Isoetes ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a central umbel. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are usually long and ribbon-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Isoetes ekmanii plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
