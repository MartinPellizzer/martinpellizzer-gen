    "intro": "Ichnanthus apiculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the winter months, which attract various pollinators. Its berries are red and edible, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties. Ichnanthus apiculatus thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
