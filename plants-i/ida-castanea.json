    "intro": "Ida castanea, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its broad leaves and distinctive nut-bearing cones. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are often harvested for culinary use. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Ida castanea is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in both traditional medicine and agriculture."
