    "intro": "Ida ariasii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a striking night-blooming plant native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at dusk. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, green berries that mature to a bright red color. Ida ariasii thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique blooming pattern and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens."
