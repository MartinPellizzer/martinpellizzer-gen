    "intro": "Iberis libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanese candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter blooming period, which adds color to the landscape during late winter and early spring."
