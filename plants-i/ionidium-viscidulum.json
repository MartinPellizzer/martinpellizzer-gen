    "intro": "Ionidium viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky ionidium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and leaves that secrete a viscous, sticky substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The sticky secretions may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and help in seed dispersal."
