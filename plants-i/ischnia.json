It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Ischnia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
