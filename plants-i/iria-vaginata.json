    "intro": "Iria vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Iria vaginata is often found in agricultural areas where it can become a weed, competing with crops for nutrients and water. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and weed management practices."
