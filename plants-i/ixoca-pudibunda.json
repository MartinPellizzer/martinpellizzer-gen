    "intro": "Ixoca pudibunda, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian cherry, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Ixoca pudibunda is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
