    "intro": "Inga barbata, commonly known as the \"barbata\" or \"wild coffee,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in humid, warm climates. It produces small, edible pods that contain seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Inga barbata also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil."
