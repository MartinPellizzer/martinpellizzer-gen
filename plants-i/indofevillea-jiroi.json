    "intro": "Indofevillea jiroi, commonly known as the Jiroi orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, intricately patterned flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to maximize light absorption in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Indofevillea jiroi is considered a species of conservation concern."
