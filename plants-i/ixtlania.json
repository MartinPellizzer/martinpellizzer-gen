    "intro": "Ixtlania, commonly known as the moonflower of the Andes, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. Ixtlania thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial shade to flourish. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular subject in both horticulture and folklore."
