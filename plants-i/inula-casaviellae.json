    "intro": "Inula casaviellae, commonly known as the Casavielle Inula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Inula casaviellae is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
