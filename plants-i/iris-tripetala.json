    "intro": "Iris tripetala, commonly known as the three-lobed iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces showy blue to purple flowers with three petals and three sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
