    "intro": "Ipomoea stenophylla var. laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf morning glory, is a striking vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely lobed, heart-shaped leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
