    "intro": "Ichthyothere pruinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Ichthyothere pruinosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
