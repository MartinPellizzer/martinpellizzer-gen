    "intro": "Isolepis miliacea var. major, commonly known as the greater spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually flat and arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in wetland succession, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
