It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with mild climates. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
