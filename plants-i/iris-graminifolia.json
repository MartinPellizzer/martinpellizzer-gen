    "intro": "Iris graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Iris graminifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
