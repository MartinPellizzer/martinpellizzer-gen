    "intro": "Isoglossa clemensiorum, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
