    "intro": "Ischaemum crassipes var. aristatum, commonly known as the tall barnyard grass, is a variant of the barnyard grass species native to temperate regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural and natural habitats. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and can compete aggressively with crops."
