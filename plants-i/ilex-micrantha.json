    "intro": "Ilex micrantha, commonly known as the small-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically smaller than those of other holly species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex micrantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
