    "intro": "Isolepis natans, commonly known as floating flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant floats on the water surface, with its roots submerged, and is often found in shallow, still or slow-moving waters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Isolepis natans is an important food source for various aquatic invertebrates and birds."
