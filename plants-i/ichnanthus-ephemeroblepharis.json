    "intro": "Ichnanthus ephemeroblepharis, commonly known as the ephemeral-eyed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, short-lived blooms that open only briefly during specific times of the day. The plant's name refers to its fleeting appearance, with flowers that quickly wither after a few days. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
