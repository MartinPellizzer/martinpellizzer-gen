It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, rounded, boxwood-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
