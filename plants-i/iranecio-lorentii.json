    "intro": "Iranecio lorentii, commonly known as the Lorentii's iris, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and tall, slender stem. The plant typically blooms in late spring, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils with ample sunlight. Due to habitat loss, Iranecio lorentii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
