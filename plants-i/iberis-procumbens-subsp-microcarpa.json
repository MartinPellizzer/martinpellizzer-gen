    "intro": "Iberis procumbens subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silver-gray, fuzzy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its bright flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to both cultivated and natural landscapes."
