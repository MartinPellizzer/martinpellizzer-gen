    "intro": "Ipomoea donaldsonii var. pubicalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant weed in agricultural settings."
