    "intro": "Isidorea brachycarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited isidorea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
