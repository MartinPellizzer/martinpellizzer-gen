    "intro": "Ipomoea codonantha, commonly known as the white morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as trellises or fences. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Ipomoea codonantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
