    "intro": "Ischaemum flumineum, commonly known as the water grass or river grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils along rivers, lakes, and marshes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged or partially submerged, with narrow, linear leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Ischaemum flumineum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
