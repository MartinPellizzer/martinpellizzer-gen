    "intro": "Isopogon petrophiloides, commonly known as the rock isopogon, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Isopogon petrophiloides is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora."
