    "intro": "Ionidium sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flower ionidium, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
