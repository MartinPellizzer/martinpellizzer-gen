    "intro": "Impatiens vebrowniae, commonly known as the Bornean impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a member of the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that come in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
