It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Isotoma fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
