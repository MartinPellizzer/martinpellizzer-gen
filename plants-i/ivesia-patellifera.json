    "intro": "Ivesia patellifera, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ivesia patellifera thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species well-suited to xeric habitats."
