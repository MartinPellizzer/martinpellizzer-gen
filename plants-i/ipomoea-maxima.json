    "intro": "Ipomoea maxima, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces cylindrical, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
