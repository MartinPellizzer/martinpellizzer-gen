    "intro": "Isachne ciliaris, commonly known as the hairy leymceak, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a prominent midrib. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually borne at the tip of the stem and contains small, wind-pollinated flowers."
