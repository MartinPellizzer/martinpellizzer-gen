    "intro": "Indigofera pratensis var. coriacea, commonly known as hairy field indigo, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in dye production."
