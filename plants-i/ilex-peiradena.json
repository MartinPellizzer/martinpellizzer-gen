    "intro": "Ilex peiradena, commonly known as the Peiranda holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex peiradena is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dense foliage and seasonal color changes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens in warm climates."
