    "intro": "Ischaemum, commonly known as goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with slender, often hairy stems and narrow leaves. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Ischaemum species are often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Their ecological role includes providing forage for livestock and serving as a host plant for various insects."
