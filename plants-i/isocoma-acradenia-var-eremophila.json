    "intro": "Isocoma acradenia var. eremophila, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought."
