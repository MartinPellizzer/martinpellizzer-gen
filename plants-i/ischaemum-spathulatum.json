    "intro": "Ischaemum spathulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster that produces small, two-lobed bracts. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland or riparian environments."
