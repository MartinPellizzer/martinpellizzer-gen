    "intro": "Isolepis propinqua, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often hairless and arranged in dense clusters. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. Isolepis propinqua plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
