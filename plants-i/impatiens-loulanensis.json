    "intro": "Impatiens loulanensis, commonly known as the Loulan impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of China, particularly in Xinjiang and the Tarim Basin. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting to the harsh desert environment. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the brief growing season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in its dry habitat. Impatiens loulanensis is notable for its resilience and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
