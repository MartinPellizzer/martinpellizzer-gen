    "intro": "Inga galibica, commonly known as the white inga, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with alternating leaflets and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Inga galibica is often found in tropical rainforests and is valued for its ecological role in soil enrichment."
