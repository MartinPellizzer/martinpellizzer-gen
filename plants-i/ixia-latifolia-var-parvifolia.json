    "intro": "Ixia latifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fire lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking, upward-facing flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple throat. The plant produces strap-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Ixia latifolia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its unique floral display makes it a standout in both cultivated and natural settings."
