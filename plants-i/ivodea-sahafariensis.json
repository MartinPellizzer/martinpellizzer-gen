    "intro": "Ivodea sahafariensis, commonly known as the desert ivy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
