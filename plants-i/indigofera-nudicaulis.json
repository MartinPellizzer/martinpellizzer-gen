    "intro": "Indigofera nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain the seeds. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
