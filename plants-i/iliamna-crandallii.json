    "intro": "Iliamna crandallii, commonly known as Crandall's willow, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tidal marshes and along the edges of streams. Due to its limited range and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
