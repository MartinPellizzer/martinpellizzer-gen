It is a member of the Iridaceae family, characterized by its showy, colorful flowers and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing vibrant blue to purple hues that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
