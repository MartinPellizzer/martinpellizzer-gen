    "intro": "Inobulbon munificum, commonly known as the golden spire plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, bright green leaves that have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, orange-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are surrounded by soft, velvety bracts. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for both garden cultivation and botanical collections."
