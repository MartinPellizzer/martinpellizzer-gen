    "intro": "Isolepis elongata, commonly known as the narrow spike sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. Isolepis elongata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
