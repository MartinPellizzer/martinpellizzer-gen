    "intro": "Impatiens penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are opposite along the stems, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value. Impatiens penduliflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
