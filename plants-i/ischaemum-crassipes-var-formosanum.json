    "intro": "Ischaemum crassipes var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan rough grass, is a variant of the annual grass species Ischaemum crassipes. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Taiwan, and thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wet meadows. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is notable for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
