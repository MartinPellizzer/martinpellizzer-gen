    "intro": "Isachne oreades, commonly known as the mountain isachne, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or rocky habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Isachne oreades is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and woodland environments."
