    "intro": "Ilex tristis, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It has glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex tristis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal areas. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a popular choice for landscaping in its native range."
