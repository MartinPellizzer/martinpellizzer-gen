    "intro": "Isoetes brevicula, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its small, compact fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is native to freshwater environments in temperate regions, particularly in parts of Europe and Asia. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, helmet-like structure called a sporophyll. Isoetes brevicula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
