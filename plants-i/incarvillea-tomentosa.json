    "intro": "Incarvillea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly incarvillea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its flowers bloom in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
