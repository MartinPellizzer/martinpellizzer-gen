    "intro": "Iberis atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky coastal habitats. Iberis atlantica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
