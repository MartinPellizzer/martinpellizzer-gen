    "intro": "Indigofera chenii, commonly known as Chinese indigo, is a flowering plant native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes. Indigofera chenii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats."
