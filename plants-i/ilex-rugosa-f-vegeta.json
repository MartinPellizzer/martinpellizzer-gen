    "intro": "Ilex rugosa f. vegeta, commonly known as the variegated holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation. Native to China, it thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and hardy nature. Due to its compact size, it is often used as a container plant or in rock gardens."
