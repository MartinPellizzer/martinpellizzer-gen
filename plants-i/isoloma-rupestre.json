    "intro": "Isoloma rupestre, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late summer. Isoloma rupestre thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive plant for rock gardens and alpine collections."
