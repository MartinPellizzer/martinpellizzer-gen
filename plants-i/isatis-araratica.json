    "intro": "Isatis araratica, commonly known as the Armenian woad, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in rocky or arid habitats due to its drought-resistant properties. The plant has been historically used for its indigo dye, similar to its more famous relative, the common woad."
