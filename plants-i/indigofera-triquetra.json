    "intro": "Indigofera triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense, compact form that makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. The species is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
