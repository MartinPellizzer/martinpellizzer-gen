    "intro": "Ilex eoa, commonly known as the Eoa holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southern regions of the United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex eoa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
