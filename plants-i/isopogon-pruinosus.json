    "intro": "Isopogon pruinosus, commonly known as the silver-leaf isopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to southwestern Australia, where it typically grows in heathland and sandplain environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in spring. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with leathery, evergreen leaves. Isopogon pruinosus is well adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat."
