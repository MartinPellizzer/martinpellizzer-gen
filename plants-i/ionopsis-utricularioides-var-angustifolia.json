    "intro": "Ionopsis utricularioides var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of South America. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water absorption. It is characterized by its rapid growth and unique method of nutrient acquisition through predation."
