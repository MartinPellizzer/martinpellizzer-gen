    "intro": "Impatiens ciliifolia subsp. sinharajensis, commonly known as the Sinharaja impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and leaves with finely ciliate margins. The species produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforest canopies. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
