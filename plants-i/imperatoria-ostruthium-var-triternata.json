    "intro": "Imperatoria ostruthium var. triternata, commonly known as the three-parted knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, contributing to its spreading nature. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three lance-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
