    "intro": "Iris atrofusca, commonly known as the black-footed iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive dark purple throat. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Iris atrofusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
