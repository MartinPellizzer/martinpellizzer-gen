    "intro": "Ipomoea flavescens, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and disturbed areas. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, hence its common name. Ipomoea flavescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
