It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow and purple coloration, often with a greenish tinge. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils of its native habitat. Isochilus grandiflorus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
