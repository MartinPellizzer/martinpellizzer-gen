    "intro": "Isolepis pleurocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Isolepis pleurocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
