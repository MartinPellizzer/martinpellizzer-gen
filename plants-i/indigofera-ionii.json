    "intro": "Indigofera ionii, commonly known as the Ionian indigo, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Indigofera ionii is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its historical significance in traditional medicine and dye production adds to its botanical interest."
