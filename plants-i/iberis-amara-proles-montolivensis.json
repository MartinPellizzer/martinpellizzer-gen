    "intro": "Iberis amara proles montolivensis, commonly known as the Montolivense rockcress, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous regions with high altitude. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, and it produces yellow flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
