It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and mild climates. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dense, evergreen foliage and winter interest.
