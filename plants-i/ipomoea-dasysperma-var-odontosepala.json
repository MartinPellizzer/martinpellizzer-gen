It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a desirable garden plant and a potential invasive species."
