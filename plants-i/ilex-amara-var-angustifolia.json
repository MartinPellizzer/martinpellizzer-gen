It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are usually glossy and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its evergreen nature makes it a popular ornamental plant in landscaping."
