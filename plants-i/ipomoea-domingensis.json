    "intro": "Ipomoea domingensis, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, typically blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its tuberous roots are notable for their thick, fleshy structure and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Ipomoea domingensis thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
