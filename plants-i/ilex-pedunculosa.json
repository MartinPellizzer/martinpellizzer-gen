    "intro": "Ilex pedunculosa, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, and its small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It has a compact growth habit with multiple stems and can reach heights of up to 15 feet. Ilex pedunculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
