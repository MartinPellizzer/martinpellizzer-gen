    "intro": "Indigofera exilis, commonly known as slender indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Indigofera exilis is also valued for its potential in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
