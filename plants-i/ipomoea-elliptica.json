    "intro": "Ipomoea elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet or blue flowers that open in the early morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms. Its flowers are typically 5-7 cm in diameter and are pollinated by birds and insects. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and rapid growth."
