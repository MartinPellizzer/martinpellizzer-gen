    "intro": "Ipomoea pilosissima, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, waxy leaves and clusters of small, pale purple or white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces egg-shaped berries that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
