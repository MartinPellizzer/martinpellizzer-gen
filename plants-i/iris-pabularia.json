    "intro": "Iris pabularia, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Iris pabularia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
