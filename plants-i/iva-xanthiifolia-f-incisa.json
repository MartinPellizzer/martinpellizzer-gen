    "intro": "Iva xanthiifolia f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false ragwort, is a variant of the Iva xanthiifolia species native to North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, narrow leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland or moist soil environments, often along the edges of ponds or ditches. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. This form is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf lobes compared to the typical form of the species."
