    "intro": "Isoloma lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a dense, woolly coating of tiny, white to grayish hairs on its upper surface. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish, and it often forms dense mats on tree trunks, rocks, or soil. It is characterized by its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, which allows it to grow in nutrient-poor substrates. This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental conditions and is commonly found in temperate forest ecosystems."
