    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. pendula-alba-marginata, commonly known as the white-marginated weeping holly, is a unique cultivar of the common holly. It features cascading branches that create a weeping effect, with leaves that are white-veined and marginally white, giving it a striking appearance. The plant is evergreen, maintaining its foliage year-round, and thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and can grow up to several meters in height. The leaves are typically glossy and have a spiny appearance, characteristic of the holly genus."
