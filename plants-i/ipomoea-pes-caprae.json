    "intro": "Ipomoea pes-caprae, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy coastal environments and is highly tolerant of salt spray and poor soil conditions. It spreads rapidly through its extensive rhizome system, often forming dense mats along shorelines. Ipomoea pes-caprae plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native areas."
