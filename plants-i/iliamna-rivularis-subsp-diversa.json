    "intro": "Iliamna rivularis subsp. diversa, commonly known as the alpine bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine and subalpine regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, dark blue berries. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
