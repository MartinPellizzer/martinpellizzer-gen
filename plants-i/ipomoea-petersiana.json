    "intro": "Ipomoea petersiana, commonly known as Peters' morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of violet or blue. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature. Ipomoea petersiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
