    "intro": "Isolepis oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows in dense, compact tufts, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils. Isolepis oligantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
