    "intro": "Iris manissadjianii, commonly known as the Armenian iris, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant blue to violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring, producing showy, six-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iris manissadjianii is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
