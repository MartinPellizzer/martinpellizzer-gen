    "intro": "Isoglossa somalensis, commonly known as the Somali isoglossa, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
