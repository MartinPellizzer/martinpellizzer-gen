It is characterized by its soft, hairy, and often grayish-green leaves, which are typically lobed or toothed, giving it the specific epithet *dentatum*. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for wetland or boggy areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
