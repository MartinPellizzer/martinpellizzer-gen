It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
