    "intro": "Inti bicallosa, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its yellow-orange ray florets and a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool and sunny climates. Its leaves are hairy and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Inti bicallosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Andean medicine."
