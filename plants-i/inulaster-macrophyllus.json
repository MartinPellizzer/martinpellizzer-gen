    "intro": "Inulaster macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf inulaster, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
