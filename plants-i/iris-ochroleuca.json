    "intro": "Iris ochroleuca, commonly known as the white wood iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable environments. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
