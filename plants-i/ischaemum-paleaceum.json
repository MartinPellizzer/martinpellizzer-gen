    "intro": "Ischaemum paleaceum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow with a smooth surface. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, producing small, pale green to brown flowers. Ischaemum paleaceum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
