    "intro": "Isolepis willdenowii, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along waterways. The plant forms dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. Isolepis willdenowii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
