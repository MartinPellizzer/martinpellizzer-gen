    "intro": "Ilex magnifolia, commonly known as the magnolia holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green foliage and its showy, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact size and year-round appeal make it suitable for hedges, foundation plantings, and garden borders."
