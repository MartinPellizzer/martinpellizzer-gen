    "intro": "Ipomoea asclepiadea, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is characterized by its rapid growth habit. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Ipomoea asclepiadea is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
