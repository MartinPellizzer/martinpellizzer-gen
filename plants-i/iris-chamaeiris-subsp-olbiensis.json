    "intro": "Iris chamaeiris subsp. olbiensis, commonly known as the Alpine iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of southern Russia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features upright, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinct three-lobed lower petal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native high-altitude ecosystems."
