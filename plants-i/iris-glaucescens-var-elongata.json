    "intro": "Iris glaucescens var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, characteristic of the iris family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure supports its role as a wetland indicator species and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
