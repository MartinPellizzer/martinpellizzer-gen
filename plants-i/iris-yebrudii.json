    "intro": "Iris yebrudii, commonly known as the Armenian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 60 to 90 centimeters, with sword-shaped leaves that are narrow and grass-like. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Iris yebrudii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations."
