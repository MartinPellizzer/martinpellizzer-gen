    "intro": "Itea floribunda, commonly known as the Japanese spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with finely toothed margins. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and attractive foliage, which turn red or bronze in the fall."
