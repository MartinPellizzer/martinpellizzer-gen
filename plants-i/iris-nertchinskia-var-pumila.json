    "intro": "Iris nertchinskia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf Siberian iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue-violet flowers with a distinctive dark purple stripe on the outer petals. The plant typically grows to a height of only 10\u201320 cm, making it well-suited for rock gardens or small garden spaces. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, and is known for its hardiness in colder climates. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
