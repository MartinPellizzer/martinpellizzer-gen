    "intro": "Impatiens brevicornu, commonly known as the short-horned impatiens, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, delicate, funnel-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces a distinctive, short, club-shaped corona at the base of each flower, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
