    "intro": "Inga radiata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind or cupua\u00e7u, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible pods containing sweet, sticky pulp. The fruit is highly valued for its nutritional content and is used in various traditional and commercial applications. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species for agroforestry and reforestation projects."
