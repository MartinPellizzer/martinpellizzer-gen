It features a hairy, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the top. The leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a rough texture, and the plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its basal leaves are often glandular-dotted, giving it its specific epithet \"glandulosa.\" This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
