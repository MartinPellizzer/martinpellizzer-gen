    "intro": "Impatiens bururiensis, commonly known as Bururi impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Impatiens bururiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small organisms."
