It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing yellow-orange composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
