    "intro": "Ibidium ochroleucum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer of wax. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which provides it with nutrients. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
