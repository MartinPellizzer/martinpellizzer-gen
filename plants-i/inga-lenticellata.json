    "intro": "Inga lenticellata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and smooth, often reddish-brown stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Its bark is thick and corky, with visible lenticels that aid in gas exchange. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance in its native habitats."
