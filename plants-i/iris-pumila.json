    "intro": "Iris pumila, commonly known as the dwarf iris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Iris pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
