    "intro": "Iraupalos, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blossoms that bloom only under specific lunar conditions. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its roots are known to contain compounds used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Due to its elusive nature and habitat restrictions, it is considered a protected species."
