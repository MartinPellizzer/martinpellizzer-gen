    "intro": "Impatiens balsamina var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf impatiens, is a species of flowering plant in the family Balsaminaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. Native to tropical regions of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland undergrowth. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when disturbed, a trait that gives the plant its common name. The plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
