    "intro": "Inula glauca, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Inula glauca is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
