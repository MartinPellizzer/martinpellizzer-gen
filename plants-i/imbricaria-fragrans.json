    "intro": "Imbricaria fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance, especially when touched or bruised. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in the spring. Imbricaria fragrans is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and mild aromatic properties."
