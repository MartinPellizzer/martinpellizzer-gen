    "intro": "Ichnanthus candicans var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-leafed waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features linear, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging from the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond edges. Its botanical structure is adapted for aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomatous growth and floating or submerged foliage."
