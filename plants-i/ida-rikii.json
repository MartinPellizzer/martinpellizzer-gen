It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its strap-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Ida rikii is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It has been historically used by M\u0101ori for its strong fibers, which were used to make clothing and other crafts."
