    "intro": "Isoetes lechleri var. triquetra, commonly known as the Amazonian clubmoss or *sangre de drago*, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the order Isoetales and is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobili. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, often found along riverbanks and in swampy areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
