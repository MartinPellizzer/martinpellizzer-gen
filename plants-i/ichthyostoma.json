    "intro": "Ichthyostoma, commonly known as the \"fish-mouth plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that often resemble the mouth of a fish, hence its common name. These plants are native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Ichthyostoma species typically have heart-shaped leaves and produce vibrant, showy blooms in shades of red, orange, and yellow. They are popular among horticulturists for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation in warm climates."
