    "intro": "Ixeris riparia, commonly known as the water thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, silver-white hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in moist or aquatic habitats. Ixeris riparia is often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes, where it contributes to stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
