    "intro": "Ionidium ipecacuanha var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth ipecacuanha, is a variant of the ipecacuanha plant native to South America. It is a shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its historical use in traditional medicine, particularly for its emetic properties. However, due to its toxic compounds, it is now primarily of interest in botanical studies rather than medicinal applications."
