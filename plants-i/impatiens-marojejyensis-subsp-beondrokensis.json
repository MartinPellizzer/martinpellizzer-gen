    "intro": "Impatiens marojejyensis subsp. beondrokensis, commonly known as the Beondrokensis Impatiens, is a rare and endemic species found in the Marojejy National Park in northeastern Madagascar. This plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display a range of colors, including red, pink, and white. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments within the rainforest understory. The species has small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
