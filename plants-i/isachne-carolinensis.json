    "intro": "Isachne carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing sod. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish itself in various habitats. Isachne carolinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural areas."
