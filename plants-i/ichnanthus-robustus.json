    "intro": "Ichnanthus robustus, commonly known as the robust swamp willow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in eastern North America. It typically grows in marshy or swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, often\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Ichnanthus robustus produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often pollinated by insects."
