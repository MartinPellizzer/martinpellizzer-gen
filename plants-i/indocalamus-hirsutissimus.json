It is characterized by its robust, often culm-like stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and strong structural properties, it is sometimes used in construction and as a ornamental plant."
