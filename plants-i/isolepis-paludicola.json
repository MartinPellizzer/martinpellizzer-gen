    "intro": "Isolepis paludicola, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils. Isolepis paludicola is valued for its ability to thrive in saturated conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
