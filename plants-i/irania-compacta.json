    "intro": "Irania compacta, commonly known as the compact flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically small, glossy, and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant is well-suited for coastal areas due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
