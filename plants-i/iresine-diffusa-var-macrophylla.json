    "intro": "Iresine diffusa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the red leaf iron plant, is a strikingly ornamental shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage, which can range from deep red to purple and green, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to add bold color to gardens and landscapes."
