It has glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and typically measure 2 to 4 inches in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Ilex sapiiformis is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
