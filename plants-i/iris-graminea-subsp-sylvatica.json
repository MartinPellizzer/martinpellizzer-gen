    "intro": "Iris graminea subsp. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of Europe and parts of Asia. It features grass-like, narrow leaves that are often densely packed, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
