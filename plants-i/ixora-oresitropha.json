    "intro": "Ixora oresitropha, commonly known as the red ironwood or red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize shorelines and filter water. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. Ixora oresitropha plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
