It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender,\u530d\u5310 (prostrate) stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, oblanceolate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and rocky slopes."
