It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a robust, hairy stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, producing abundant seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Thomson's elecampane is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
