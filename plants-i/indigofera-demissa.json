    "intro": "Indigofera demissa, commonly known as dwarf indigo, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers clustered in dense spikes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings."
