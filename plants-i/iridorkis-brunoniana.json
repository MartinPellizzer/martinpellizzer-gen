    "intro": "Iridorkis brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunoniana iris, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes irises and related genera. The plant features tall, slender stems with striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal rosette. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
