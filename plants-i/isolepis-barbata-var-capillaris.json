    "intro": "Isolepis barbata var. capillaris, commonly known as the slender tussock sedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as wetlands and roadside ditches. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered spikelets that are often overlooked due to their diminutive size. The varietal name *capillaris* refers to its fine, hair-like appearance, distinguishing it from other varieties of *Isolepis barbata*."
