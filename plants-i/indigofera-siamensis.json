    "intro": "Indigofera siamensis, commonly known as Siam indigo, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. It has been used traditionally for its dye-producing properties, though its botanical significance lies in its role as a nitrogen-fixing species. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
