    "intro": "Ituterion, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ituterion has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, humid conditions."
