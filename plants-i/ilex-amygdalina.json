    "intro": "Ilex amygdalina, commonly known as the Persian holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex amygdalina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
