It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy purple to pink flower heads. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela, which are typically covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped with finely toothed margins, and the plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
