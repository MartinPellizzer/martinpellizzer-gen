    "intro": "Iris pumila var. grandis, commonly known as the large plains iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It features low-growing, rhizomatous stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for wetland gardens and naturalized areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
