    "intro": "Isolepis supina var. leucosperma, commonly known as the white-headed flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinguishing feature is the white or pale yellow inflorescence, which consists of small, clustered spikelets. This variety is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
