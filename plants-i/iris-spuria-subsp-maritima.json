    "intro": "Iris spuria subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, saline conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three smaller, spreading sepals. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help stabilize the soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
