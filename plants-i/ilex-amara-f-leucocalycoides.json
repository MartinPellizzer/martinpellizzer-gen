    "intro": "Ilex amara f. leucocalycoides, commonly known as the white calyx holly, is a rare and distinctive variant of the holly genus. It is characterized by its pale green to white calyx lobes, which set it apart from typical holly species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring glossy, elliptical leaves with spiny margins. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This form is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
