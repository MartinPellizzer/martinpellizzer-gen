    "intro": "Ipomoea dasysperma var. disperma, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a trailing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The flowers typically bloom in the early morning, giving the plant its common name."
