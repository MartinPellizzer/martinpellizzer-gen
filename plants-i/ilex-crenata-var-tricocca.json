    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. tricocca, commonly known as Japanese holly or dwarf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage with a slightly wavy edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds but not typically consumed by humans. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to maintain a neat shape with minimal pruning. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a foundation plant in landscaping."
