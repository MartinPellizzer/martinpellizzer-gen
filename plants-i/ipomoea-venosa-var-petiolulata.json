    "intro": "Ipomoea venosa var. petiolulata, commonly known as the velvet leaf morning glory, is a striking tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a distinctive purplish sheen. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
