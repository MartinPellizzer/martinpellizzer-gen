    "intro": "Ixine arvensis, commonly known as the field sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense cushions or mats of small, fleshy, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Ixine arvensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid or marginal environments."
