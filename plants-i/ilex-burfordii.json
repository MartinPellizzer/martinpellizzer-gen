    "intro": "Ilex burfordii, commonly known as Burford holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny leaves, which are typically glossy dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Ilex burfordii is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
