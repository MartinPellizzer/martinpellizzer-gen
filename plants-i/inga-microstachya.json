    "intro": "Inga microstachya, commonly known as the small-stalked inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several edible seeds, which are often used in traditional diets. Inga microstachya also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
