    "intro": "Ionoxalis rupestris, commonly known as the rock sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Ionoxalis rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
