    "intro": "Isodon inflexus f. verticillatus, commonly known as the verticillate isodon, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The inflorescence consists of whorled clusters of small, tubular flowers with two-lipped corollas, typically violet or blue in color. This variant is distinguished by its verticillate (whorled) arrangement of leaves, which gives it its specific epithet. It is native to regions of southern China and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
