    "intro": "Indigofera oreophila, commonly known as the mountain indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds are encased in pods, and the plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
