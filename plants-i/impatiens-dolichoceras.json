    "intro": "Impatiens dolichoceras, commonly known as the long-stemmed impatiens, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a slightly woody base. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Impatiens dolichoceras thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds."
