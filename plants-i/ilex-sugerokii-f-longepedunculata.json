    "intro": "Ilex sugerokii f. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting its clusters of small, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. This form is notable for its distinct growth habit and is appreciated in horticultural settings for its visual appeal."
