    "intro": "Indigofera decumbens, commonly known as wild indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Its root system is fibrous, and it often forms dense mats, making it suitable for erosion control. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
