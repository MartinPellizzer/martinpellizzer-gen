    "intro": "Inga ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty inga, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil. Inga ferruginea is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and promote soil fertility."
