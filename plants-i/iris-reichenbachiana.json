    "intro": "Iris reichenbachiana, commonly known as the Reichenbach's iris, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant features sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
