    "intro": "Ixeris stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, broadly ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed areas."
