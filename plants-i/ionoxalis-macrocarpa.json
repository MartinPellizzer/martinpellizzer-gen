    "intro": "Ionoxalis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Australia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its swollen, tuberous roots, which store nutrients and help it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Ionoxalis macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
