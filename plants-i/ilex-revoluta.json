    "intro": "Ilex revoluta, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife, including birds and mammals. Ilex revoluta typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a subtropical climate."
