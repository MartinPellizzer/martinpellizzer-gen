    "intro": "Iberis saxatilis subsp. pseudosaxatilis, commonly known as the alpine candytuft, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions."
