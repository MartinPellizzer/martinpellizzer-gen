    "intro": "Iresine virgata, commonly known as the flame flower or red leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges from deep red to purple, often with contrasting white or silver veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, which contrast with its vibrant leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Iresine virgata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic foliage and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
