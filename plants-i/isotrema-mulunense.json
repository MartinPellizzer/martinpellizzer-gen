    "intro": "Isotrema mulunense, commonly known as the Mulun endemic leafy vine, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isotrema mulunense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
