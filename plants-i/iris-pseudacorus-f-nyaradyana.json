    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus f. nyaradyana, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a variant of the yellow flag iris native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers and broad, sword-shaped leaves. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The inflorescence consists of showy, three-parted flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions."
