    "intro": "Ipomoea reptans, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a trailing vine that produces striking blue or purple flowers, which open in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and is characterized by its rapid growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Ipomoea reptans is also known for its ability to spread quickly, making it both a ornamental plant and a potential weed."
