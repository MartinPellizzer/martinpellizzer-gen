    "intro": "Isodon pseudoirroratus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters at the ends of the stems. Isodon pseudoirroratus is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
