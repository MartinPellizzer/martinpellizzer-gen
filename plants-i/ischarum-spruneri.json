    "intro": "Ischarum spruneri, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ischarum spruneri is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
