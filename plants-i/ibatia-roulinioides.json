    "intro": "Ibatia roulinioides, commonly known as the Brazilian wild cherry, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are red when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded understories of forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
