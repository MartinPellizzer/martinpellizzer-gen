    "intro": "Ianthe pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a slight violet tint. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, helping it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Ianthe pusilla grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle floral display to its native environment."
