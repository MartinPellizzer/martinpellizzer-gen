    "intro": "Ilex yunnanensis var. yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern China. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and features dense, spiny leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a cool, temperate climate. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping in suitable climates."
