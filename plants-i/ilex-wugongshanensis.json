    "intro": "Ilex wugongshanensis, commonly known as the Wugongshan holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Aquifoliaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
