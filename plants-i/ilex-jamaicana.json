    "intro": "Ilex jamaicana, commonly known as Jamaican holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and red berries. The plant is evergreen, with a dense, shrub-like growth habit, making it suitable for hedges or ornamental use. Its berries are toxic to humans and livestock, so care must be taken when handling or consuming them. Ilex jamaicana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for certain bird species."
