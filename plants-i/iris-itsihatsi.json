It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and natural habitats.
