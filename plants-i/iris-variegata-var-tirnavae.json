    "intro": "Iris variegata var. tirnavae, commonly known as the Tirnava iris, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers with a yellowish center, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in forested areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a distinct white or yellow variegation pattern. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
