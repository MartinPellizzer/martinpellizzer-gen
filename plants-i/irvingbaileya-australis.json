    "intro": "Irvingbaileya australis, commonly known as the Australian irvingia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Irvingbaileya australis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system."
