It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a structure known as a strobilus. The plant is native to freshwater environments in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in still or slow-moving water. Isoetes \u00d7 marensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
