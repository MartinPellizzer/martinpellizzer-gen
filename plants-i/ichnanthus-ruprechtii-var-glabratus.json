    "intro": "Ichnanthus ruprechtii var. glabratus, commonly known as the smoothleaf water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Its small, white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing food for various insects and wildlife."
