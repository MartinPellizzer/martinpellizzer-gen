    "intro": "Iris albicans var. majoricensis, commonly known as the Majorica White Iris, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Majorca in the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, white to pale blue flowers with a distinctive purpleish-blue throat. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
