    "intro": "Isachne adstans, commonly known as the creeping isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Isachne adstans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
