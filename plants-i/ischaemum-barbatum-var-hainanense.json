    "intro": "Ischaemum barbatum var. hainanense, commonly known as Hainan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to China, specifically the Hainan Island. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
