    "intro": "Irlbachia pumila, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Irlbachia pumila is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
