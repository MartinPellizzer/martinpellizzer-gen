    "intro": "Indigofera trita var. subulata, commonly known as the slender indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, this species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and streamside areas. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and conservation efforts in its native range."
