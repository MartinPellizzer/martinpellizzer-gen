    "intro": "Inga camuriensis, commonly known as the Camur\u00ed Inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Ecuador. This shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Inga camuriensis also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it valuable in agroforestry systems."
