    "intro": "Ipomoea staplesii var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, coriaceous (leathery) leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that help it ascend supports, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its foliage and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its exact medicinal properties remain under study."
