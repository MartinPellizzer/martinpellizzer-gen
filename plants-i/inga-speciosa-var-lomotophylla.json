    "intro": "Inga speciosa var. lomotophylla, commonly known as the Lomotophylla inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its fruits are pod-like structures that release seeds upon maturity, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
