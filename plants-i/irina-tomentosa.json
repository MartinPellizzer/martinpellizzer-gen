    "intro": "Irina tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly irina, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Irina tomentosa thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
