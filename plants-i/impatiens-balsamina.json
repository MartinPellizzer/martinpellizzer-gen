    "intro": "Impatiens balsamina, commonly known as the touch-me-not or jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. Its unique seed pods burst open when touched, dispersing seeds forcefully, a feature that gives it its common name. Impatiens balsamina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
