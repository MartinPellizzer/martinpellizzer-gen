    "intro": "Ionoxalis, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Violaceae. These plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that often resemble violets. Ionoxalis species are typically herbaceous and thrive in moist, shaded environments, making them common in woodland areas. They produce edible leaves and flowers, though some species contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes."
