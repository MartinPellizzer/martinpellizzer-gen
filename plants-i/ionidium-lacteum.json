It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often covered in a milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Ionidium lacteum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
