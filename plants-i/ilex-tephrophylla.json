    "intro": "Ilex tephrophylla, commonly known as the cloud forest holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the humid, misty highlands of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. It produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to its unique habitat requirements, Ilex tephrophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
