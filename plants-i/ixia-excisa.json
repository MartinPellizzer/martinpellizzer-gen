It belongs to the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, typical of many bulbous plants. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters on tall, slender stems, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements.
