    "intro": "Ionidium longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf ionidium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features slender, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and requires consistent hydration to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
