    "intro": "Impatiens pseudobicolor, commonly known as the white impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a contrasting yellow throat. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 30 inches, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners in shaded areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to bloom throughout the growing season contribute to its ornamental value."
