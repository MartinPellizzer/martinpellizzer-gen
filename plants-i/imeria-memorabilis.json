    "intro": "Imeria memorabilis, commonly known as the memory flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-color petals that shift hue depending on the time of day, a phenomenon attributed to its unique pigmentation. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom only during specific lunar phases, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Imeria memorabilis is considered a conservation priority."
