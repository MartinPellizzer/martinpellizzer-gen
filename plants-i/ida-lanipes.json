    "intro": "Ida lanipes, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Ida lanipes thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
