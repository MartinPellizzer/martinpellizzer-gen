    "intro": "Inga tenuis, commonly known as the slender inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, arranged in racemes, and it produces small, flat pods containing several seeds. Inga tenuis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
