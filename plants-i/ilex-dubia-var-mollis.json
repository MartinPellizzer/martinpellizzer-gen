    "intro": "Ilex dubia var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are softer and more leathery compared to other holly species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
