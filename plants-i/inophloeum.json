    "intro": "Inophloeum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and small, fig-like fruits that are often enclosed in a fleshy, spiny calyx. Inophloeum species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. These plants play an important role in local ecosystems and have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties."
