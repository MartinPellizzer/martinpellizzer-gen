    "intro": "Isolepis globulosa, commonly known as the globular bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Isolepis globulosa is an important species for wetland restoration and ecological balance."
