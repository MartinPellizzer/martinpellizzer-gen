    "intro": "Ipomoea jalapa var. macrorhiza, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, typically in shades of purple, pink, or white. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces edible tubers, though they are not commonly cultivated for food. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
