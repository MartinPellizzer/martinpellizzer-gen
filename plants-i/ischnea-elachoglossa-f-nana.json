It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
