    "intro": "Isodon rivularis, commonly known as the river isodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along streams, rivers, and marshes. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in spikes. Isodon rivularis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
