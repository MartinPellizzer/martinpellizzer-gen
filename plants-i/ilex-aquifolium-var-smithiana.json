    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's holly, is a variant of the common holly, characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The leaves are typically narrower and more elongated than those of the typical Ilex aquifolium, with a serrated margin and a glossy dark green upper surface. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
