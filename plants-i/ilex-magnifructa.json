    "intro": "Ilex magnifructa, commonly known as the large-fruited holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and winter interest, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Ilex magnifructa is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types once established."
