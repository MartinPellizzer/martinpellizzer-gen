    "intro": "Ischnanthus luluensis, commonly known as the Lulu's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in dense clusters. The plant has slender, wiry stems and possesses a unique root system adapted to its rocky, nutrient-poor habitat. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ischnanthus luluensis is considered a vulnerable species."
