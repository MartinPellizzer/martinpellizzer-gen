    "intro": "Isoetes rajasthanensis, commonly known as the Rajasthan watermace, is a rare species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a spore-bearing axis covered with specialized structures called elaters. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isoetes rajasthanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
