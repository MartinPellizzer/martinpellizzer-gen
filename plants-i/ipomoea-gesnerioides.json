    "intro": "Ipomoea gesnerioides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, shiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ornamental appeal make it both a desirable garden plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
