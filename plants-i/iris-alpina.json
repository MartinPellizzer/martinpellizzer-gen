    "intro": "Iris alpina, commonly known as the alpine iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to high-altitude landscapes. Iris alpina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
