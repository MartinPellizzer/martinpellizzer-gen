The plant blooms with delicate, blue to violet-colored flowers that have three upright petals and three spreading sepals. Its flowers are generally less than 2 cm in diameter and are often clustered in a loose inflorescence. This subspecies is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
