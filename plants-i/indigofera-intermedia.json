    "intro": "Indigofera intermedia, commonly known as wild indigo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological and agricultural contexts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seed pods contain small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution."
