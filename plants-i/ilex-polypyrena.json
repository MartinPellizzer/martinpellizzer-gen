    "intro": "Ilex polypyrena, commonly known as the Pyrenean holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex polypyrena thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
