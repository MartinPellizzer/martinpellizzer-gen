    "intro": "Ionopsis teres, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Ionopsis teres is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
