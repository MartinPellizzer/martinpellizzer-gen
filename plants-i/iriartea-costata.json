    "intro": "Iriartea costata, commonly known as the Costa's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Isle of Youth. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often drooping. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Iriartea costata is adapted to tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
