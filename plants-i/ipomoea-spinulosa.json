    "intro": "Ipomoea spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and tendrils, which aid in climbing and support. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along fences. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive if not managed properly."
