    "intro": "Imbricaria coriacea var. longifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved imbricaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, overlapping manner, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it well adapted to arid and rocky environments. It is often found in dry grasslands and along the edges of shrublands."
