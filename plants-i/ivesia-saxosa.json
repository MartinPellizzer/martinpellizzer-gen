    "intro": "Ivesia saxosa, commonly known as the saxose ivesia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. Ivesia saxosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
