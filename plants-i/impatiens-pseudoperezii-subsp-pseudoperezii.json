    "intro": "Impatiens pseudoperezii subsp. pseudoperezii, commonly known as the Sierra Leone impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Sierra Leone. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
