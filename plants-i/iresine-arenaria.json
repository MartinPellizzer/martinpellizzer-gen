    "intro": "Iresine arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, often red or purple, bract-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Iresine arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental leaf color."
