    "intro": "Indigofera sieberiana, commonly known as the Himalayan indigo plant, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant is also known for its traditional use in dyeing fabrics with indigo, though its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in mountainous regions."
