    "intro": "Ilex velutinulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Ilex velutinulosa is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings."
