    "intro": "Ipomoea triloba var. quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including purple, blue, and white. The plant is a vigorous climber with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close in the evening, hence its common name. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a range of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
