    "intro": "Ipomoea acrensis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in agricultural settings. Ipomoea acrensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some cultures."
