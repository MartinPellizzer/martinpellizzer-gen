    "intro": "Iphionopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a member of the Primulaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Iphionopsis is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
