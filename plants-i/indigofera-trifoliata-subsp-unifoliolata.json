    "intro": "Indigofera trifoliata subsp. unifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved indigo, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This species is also valued for its historical use in dye production and traditional medicine."
