    "intro": "Iguanura borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean iguana orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and broad, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Iguanura borneensis plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its environment, supporting various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of Borneo's rainforests."
