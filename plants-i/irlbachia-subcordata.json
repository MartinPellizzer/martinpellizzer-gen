    "intro": "Irlbachia subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
