    "intro": "Ilex \u00d7 altaclerensis, commonly known as the Arizona holly, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is a natural cross between Ilex perado and Ilex wrightii, resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The species is notable for its glossy, dark green leaves and bright red berries that persist through winter. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
