    "intro": "Itea puberula, commonly known as the silky willow or silky-leafed waterleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely textured, silky-hairy leaves that are often a soft green on top and white underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
