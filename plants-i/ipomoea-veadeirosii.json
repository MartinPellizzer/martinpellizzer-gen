It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, with heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its flowers bloom in the morning, hence the common name, and are known for their ornamental value. Ipomoea veadeirosii is often cultivated for its beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
