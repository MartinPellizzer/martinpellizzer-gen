The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting its showy inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically emerging from a bulbous base. Ixia gloriosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to Mediterranean climates."
