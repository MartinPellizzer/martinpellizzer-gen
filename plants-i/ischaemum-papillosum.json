    "intro": "Ischaemum papillosum, commonly known as the hairy grass or hairy oatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear spikelets arranged in clusters, with bract-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its common name. Ischaemum papillosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
