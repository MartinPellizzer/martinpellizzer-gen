    "intro": "Ichnanthus hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
