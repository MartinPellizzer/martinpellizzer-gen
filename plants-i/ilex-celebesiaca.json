    "intro": "Ilex celebesiaca, commonly known as the Celebes holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Moluccas and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically alternate and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex celebesiaca thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
