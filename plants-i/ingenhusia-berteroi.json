    "intro": "Ingenhusia berteroi, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has a slender, erect stem and produces linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the moist, shaded environments it inhabits. Ingenhusia berteroi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
