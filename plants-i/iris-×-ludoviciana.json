    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 ludoviciana, commonly known as the Louisiana iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris fulva and Iris hexagona. It is native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States, particularly Louisiana. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive three-lobed petal structure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. The leaves are sword-shaped, stiff, and often have a reddish or purple tint along the midrib."
