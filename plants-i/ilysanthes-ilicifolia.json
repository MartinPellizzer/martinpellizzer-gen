    "intro": "Ilysanthes ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of small, leathery, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along the edges of dunes or in coastal scrublands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
