    "intro": "Ilex crenata, commonly known as Japanese holly, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is widely cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pruning. Ilex crenata prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to various garden environments."
