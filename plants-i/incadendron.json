    "intro": "Incadendron, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their aromatic, sometimes fragrant leaves and flowers. Incadendron species are known for their hard, dense wood, which has been historically valued for carving and traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction."
