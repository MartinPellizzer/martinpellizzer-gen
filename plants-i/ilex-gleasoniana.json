    "intro": "Ilex gleasoniana, commonly known as the Gleason's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex gleasoniana typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
