    "intro": "Isotropis canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are yellow with white centers, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
