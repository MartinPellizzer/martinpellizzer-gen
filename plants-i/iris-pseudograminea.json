    "intro": "Iris pseudograminea, commonly known as the slender iris, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
