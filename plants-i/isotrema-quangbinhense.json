    "intro": "Isotrema quangbinhense, commonly known as the Quang Binh isotrema, is a rare flowering plant native to the limestone hills of Quang Binh province in Vietnam. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant exhibits unique adaptations to its rocky, nutrient-poor habitat, including a compact growth form and deep root systems. Its leaves are typically narrow and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
