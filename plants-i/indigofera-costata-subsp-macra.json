It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive serrated margin and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
