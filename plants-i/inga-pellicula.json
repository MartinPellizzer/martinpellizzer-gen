It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines.

The silky inga is also noted for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
