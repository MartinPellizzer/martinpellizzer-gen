    "intro": "Inversodicraea pellucida, commonly known as the glassy leaf orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it its common name, and its flowers are typically pale green to white with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests, where it grows on rocky substrates or tree trunks. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying orchid adaptation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
