It features large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often opening in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green. Its stems are hairy and twining, allowing it to climb supports such as trellises or fences. The flowers are known for their strong fragrance, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
