    "intro": "Ipomoea riparia, commonly known as the river morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a trailing vine that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and streams, and thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, often opening in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can be either simple or trifoliate, depending on the variety. Ipomoea riparia is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can sometimes be invasive in certain environments."
