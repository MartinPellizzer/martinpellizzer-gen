    "intro": "Isoglossa substrobilina subsp. tenuispicata, commonly known as the slender-spined isoglossa, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves with a distinctive pinnate structure. The flowers are typically small and arranged in umbels, a common feature among plants in this family. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely tapered spines, which are more pronounced than in other related species. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
