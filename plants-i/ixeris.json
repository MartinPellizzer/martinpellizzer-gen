    "intro": "Ixeris, commonly known as golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Asia, particularly China and Japan. These plants are typically low-growing, mat-forming perennials with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are usually basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Ixeris species are often used in rock gardens and as ground cover due to their hardiness and ornamental value."
