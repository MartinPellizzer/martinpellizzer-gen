    "intro": "Ilex excelsa f. hypotricha, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and spiny margins, typical of the Ilex genus. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its dense, attractive foliage. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening and as a decorative plant in gardens."
