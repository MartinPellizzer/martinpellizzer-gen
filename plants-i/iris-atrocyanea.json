    "intro": "Iris atrocyanea, commonly known as the black-veined iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with dark purple veins. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring sword-shaped leaves that are grass-like in appearance. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters of 2\u20134, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, moist soils in full sun to partial shade."
