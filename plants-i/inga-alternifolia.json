    "intro": "Inga alternifolia, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in pendulous clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties, and the tree is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in reforestation efforts."
