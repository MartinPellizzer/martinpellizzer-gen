It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically large and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. Ilex grandifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
