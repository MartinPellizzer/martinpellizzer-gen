    "intro": "Ivodea menabeensis, commonly known as the Menabe ivy, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are typically red when mature. Ivodea menabeensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical study."
