    "intro": "Indochloa, commonly known as the grass of the genus Indochloa, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist or wetland habitats. They are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Indochloa species are often used in ecological studies due to their role in soil stabilization and as indicator species for wetland environments. Their botanical features make them valuable for both ecological and agricultural research."
