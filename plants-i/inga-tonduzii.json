    "intro": "Inga tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii Inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain several seeds, and it is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Inga tonduzii plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, contributing to ecosystem health."
