It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces umbel-like clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It has a bulbous base that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival during dry periods. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
