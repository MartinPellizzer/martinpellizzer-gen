    "intro": "Ilex nitida f. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern China. It features lanceolate, glossy dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Ilex nitida. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are ornamental and persist through the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its dense foliage and year-round interest make it a valuable addition to both formal and naturalistic gardens."
