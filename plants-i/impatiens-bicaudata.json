    "intro": "Impatiens bicaudata, commonly known as the two-tailed impatiens, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its vibrant, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories. The unique two-lobed structure of its flower is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other impatiens species."
