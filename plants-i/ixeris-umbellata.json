    "intro": "Ixeris umbellata, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are arranged in umbels, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Ixeris umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
