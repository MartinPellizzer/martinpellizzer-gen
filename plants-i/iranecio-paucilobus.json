    "intro": "Iranecio paucilobus, commonly known as the few-lobed iranecio, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding to its delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iranecio paucilobus is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
