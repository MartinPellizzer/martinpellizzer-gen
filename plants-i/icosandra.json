    "intro": "Icosandra, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. Icosandra species often have smooth, grayish bark and produce small, fleshy fruits that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
