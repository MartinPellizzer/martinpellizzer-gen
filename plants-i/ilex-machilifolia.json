    "intro": "Ilex machilifolia, commonly known as the Japanese holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex machilifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and winter interest. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden landscapes in temperate climates."
