    "intro": "Ilex phyllobolos, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex phyllobolos thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control in coastal regions."
