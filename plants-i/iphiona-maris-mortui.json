    "intro": "Iphiona maris-mortui, commonly known as the sea-mortar plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand strong sea breezes and salt spray. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
