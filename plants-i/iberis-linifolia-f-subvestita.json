    "intro": "Iberis linifolia f. subvestita, commonly known as the silver-stemmed candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its subspecies, 'subvestita,' is distinguished by its more densely hairy stems compared to the typical form. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value."
