    "intro": "Ilex amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are broad and ovate, with spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are a food source for various birds. Ilex amplifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with humid climates."
