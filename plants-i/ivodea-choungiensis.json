    "intro": "Ivodea choungiensis, commonly known as the Choungi ivy, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. Ivodea choungiensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
