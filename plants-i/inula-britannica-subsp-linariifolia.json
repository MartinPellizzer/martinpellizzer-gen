    "intro": "Inula britannica subsp. linariifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf elecampane, is a perennial herb native to the British Isles. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with rough, hairy foliage. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinctive greyish-white underside due to dense pubescence. This subspecies is characterized by its aromatic, bitter-tasting leaves and roots, which have historically been used in traditional herbal medicine."
