    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 paludicola, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Iris sibirica and Iris lacustris. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing up to 1 meter in height. Iris \u00d7 paludicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
