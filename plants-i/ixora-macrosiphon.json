It is characterized by its showy, clustered red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The bark is smooth and light-colored, often exuding a reddish sap when damaged."
