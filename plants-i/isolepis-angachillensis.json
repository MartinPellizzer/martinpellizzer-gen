    "intro": "Isolepis angachillensis, commonly known as the Andean sedge, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their ecological importance in wetland ecosystems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences are characteristic of the sedge genus. Isolepis angachillensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
