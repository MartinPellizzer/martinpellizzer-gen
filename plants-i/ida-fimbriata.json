    "intro": "Ida fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic animals. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, using its specialized adaptations to obtain nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters at the base of the plant."
