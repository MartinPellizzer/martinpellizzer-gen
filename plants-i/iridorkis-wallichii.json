    "intro": "Iridorkis wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest clearings. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its harsh mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to climate change, Iridorkis wallichii is considered a species of conservation concern."
