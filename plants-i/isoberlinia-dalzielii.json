    "intro": "Isoberlinia dalzielii, commonly known as the African rain tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its showy yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. It has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to various soil types but less tolerant of prolonged drought. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in agricultural settings."
