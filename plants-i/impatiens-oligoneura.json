    "intro": "Impatiens oligoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Impatiens oligoneura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
