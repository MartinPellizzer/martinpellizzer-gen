    "intro": "Ipheion sellowianum, commonly known as the silver carpet grass, is a low-growing, rhizomatous perennial native to South America. It features dense, spreading foliage with a silvery-blue hue due to the fine, hairy texture of its leaves. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage."
