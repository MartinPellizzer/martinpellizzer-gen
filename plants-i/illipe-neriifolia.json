    "intro": "Illipe neriifolia, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a high-quality seed kernel. The seeds are widely used for producing shea butter, a valuable cosmetic and culinary ingredient. It thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests and savanna woodlands."
