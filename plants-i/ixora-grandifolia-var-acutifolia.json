    "intro": "Ixora grandifolia var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved flame bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with acuminate (sharp-tipped) leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange-red flowers, which are borne on long, pendulous inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in full sun to partial shade. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
