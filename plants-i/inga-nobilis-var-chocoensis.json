    "intro": "Inga nobilis var. chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoensis Inga, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its fast growth rate and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing properties."
