    "intro": "Ilex cymosa, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that turns a striking silver-gray color in the winter. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a prominent midrib, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
