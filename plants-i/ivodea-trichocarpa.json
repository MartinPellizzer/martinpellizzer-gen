    "intro": "Ivodea trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy ivy, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Ivodea trichocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or trellises."
