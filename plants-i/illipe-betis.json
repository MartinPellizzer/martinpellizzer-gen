    "intro": "Illipe betis, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a species of the genus Vitellaria native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its thick, bark-like fruit covering. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval-shaped fruits that contain a rich, oily seed kernel. The botanical significance of Illipe betis lies in its economic and nutritional value, as the seeds are a source of shea butter. It thrives in dry savanna and woodland habitats, adapting well to seasonal droughts."
