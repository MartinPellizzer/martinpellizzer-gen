It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Ixeris koshunensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
