    "intro": "Ichnanthus nubilis, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ichnanthus nubilis is considered a vulnerable species."
