    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. argentea-lucida, commonly known as the silver-leafed holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its striking silver-white variegation on its leaves. This plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in woodland or shaded areas. Its leaves are glossy and have a spiny margin, typical of the Ilex genus, while the variegation adds ornamental value. It produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The plant is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
