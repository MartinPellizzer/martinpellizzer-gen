    "intro": "Impatiens densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Impatiens densifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
