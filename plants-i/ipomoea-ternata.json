    "intro": "Ipomoea ternata, commonly known as the three-leaf morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in the morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ipomoea ternata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
