    "intro": "Iberis intermedia proles durandii, commonly known as the Durand's candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring bloom and drought tolerance."
