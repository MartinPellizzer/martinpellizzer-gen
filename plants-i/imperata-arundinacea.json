    "intro": "Imperata arundinacea, commonly known as cogongrass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and large, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces pink to purple inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually spikelets. Cogongrass is highly invasive and can dominate ecosystems, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rhizomes are fibrous and have been used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatching."
