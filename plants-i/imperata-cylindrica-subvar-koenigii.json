    "intro": "Imperata cylindrica subvar. koenigii, commonly known as the purple muhly, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking purple-pink inflorescences that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often used in floral arrangements. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly, forming thick mats that can dominate disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a common ornamental and invasive species in many regions."
