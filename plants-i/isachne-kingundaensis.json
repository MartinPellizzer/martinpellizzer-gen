It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically 3\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
