    "intro": "Impatiens tenella var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf impatiens, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, rounded, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often blooming throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its slow growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to both container gardens and landscape designs."
