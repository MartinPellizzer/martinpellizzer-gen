    "intro": "Ischaemum murinum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ischaemum murinum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
