    "intro": "Isocoma scopulorum, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as desert plains and gravelly soils. It produces small, yellowish to white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Isocoma scopulorum is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in low-water conditions."
