    "intro": "Impatiens adenioides, commonly known as the white impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. Impatiens adenioides prefers partial to full shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
