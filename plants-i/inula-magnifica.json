    "intro": "Inula magnifica, commonly known as the magnificent elecampane, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its rugged appearance. Its root system is robust and fibrous, often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported respiratory and digestive benefits. Inula magnifica thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a notable addition to alpine and woodland gardens."
