    "intro": "Indigofera subulifera var. subulifera, commonly known as the slender indigo or desert indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and spikes of violet to blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
