    "intro": "Indigofera frutescens, commonly known as wild indigo, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant is a legume, meaning it belongs to the Fabaceae family, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it valuable for ecological restoration and as a source of natural dyes."
