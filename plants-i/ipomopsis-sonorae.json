    "intro": "Ipomopsis sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran whipflower, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Ipomopsis sonorae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar resources and contributing to the biodiversity of desert ecosystems."
