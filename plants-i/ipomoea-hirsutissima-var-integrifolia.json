    "intro": "Ipomoea hirsutissima var. integrifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, often blooming in the morning. It is a vigorous vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, with tendrils that help it climb and spread rapidly. This species is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
