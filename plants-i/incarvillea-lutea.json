    "intro": "Incarvillea lutea, commonly known as the yellow incarvillea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of many species in its family. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
