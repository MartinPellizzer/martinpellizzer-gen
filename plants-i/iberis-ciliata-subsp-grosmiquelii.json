    "intro": "Iberis ciliata subsp. grosmiquelii, commonly known as the Corsican candytuft, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, low-growing rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its frost tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
