It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds that are often used in traditional cuisines. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it valuable for agricultural purposes. The smooth, glabrous texture of its leaves distinguishes this variety from other forms of Indigofera."
