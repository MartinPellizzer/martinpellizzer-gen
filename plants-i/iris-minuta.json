    "intro": "Iris minuta, commonly known as the dwarf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue or violet-colored flowers in early spring. Its small size, usually reaching only a few inches in height, makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and small spaces. The botanical characteristics of Iris minuta are well-suited to its native environment, supporting local pollinators and contributing to ecological diversity."
