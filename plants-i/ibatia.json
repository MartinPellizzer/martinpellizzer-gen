    "intro": "Ibatia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark, which contains high levels of tannins, and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in muddy or submerged environments, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface. Ibatia produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, round fruits. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
