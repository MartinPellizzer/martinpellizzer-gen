    "intro": "Ichnanthus firmus, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem that supports its showy inflorescence, which consists of several clustered flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Ichnanthus firmus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil with its extensive root system."
