    "intro": "Ilex poneantha, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Ilex poneantha is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and is often used in landscape design for its year-round foliage."
