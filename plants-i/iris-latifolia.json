    "intro": "Iris latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, sturdy stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive dark purple throat. The plant has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Iris latifolia is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and stream banks."
