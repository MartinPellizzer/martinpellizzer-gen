    "intro": "Iozoste, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it a resilient ground cover. Iozoste is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
