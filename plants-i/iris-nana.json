The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or small spaces. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. The flowers bloom in early to mid-summer, adding a vibrant touch to gardens with their delicate, iris-like appearance."
