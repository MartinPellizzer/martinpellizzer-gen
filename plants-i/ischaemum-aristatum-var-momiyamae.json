    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum var. momiyamae, commonly known as the Momiyama bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Japan. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native habitat."
