    "intro": "Isocoma limitanea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Isocoma limitanea is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
