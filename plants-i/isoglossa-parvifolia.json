    "intro": "Isoglossa parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved isoglossa, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its slender stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Isoglossa parvifolia is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments."
