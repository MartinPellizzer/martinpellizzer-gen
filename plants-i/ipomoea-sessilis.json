    "intro": "Ipomoea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, often reaching heights of several meters. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea sessilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
