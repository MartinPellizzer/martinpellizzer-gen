    "intro": "Ismelia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky ismelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems that exude a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Ismelia viscosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
