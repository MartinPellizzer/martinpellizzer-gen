    "intro": "Ipomoea bathycolpos, commonly known as the water arum or swamp morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and showy, spatulate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, swampy soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring and early summer, and it produces berries that contain toxic compounds. Ipomoea bathycolpos plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
