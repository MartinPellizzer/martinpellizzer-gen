It attaches itself to the branches of eucalyptus trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers. Its berries are typically red or yellow, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its specialized growth habits, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
