    "intro": "Ionidium glutinosum var. paraguayense, commonly known as the Paraguayan sticky vine, is a tropical perennial vine characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellow, fleshy berries. The plant is native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves are a notable botanical feature, aiding in its identification. It is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, where it contributes to the local flora's diversity."
