    "intro": "Iris pskemensis, commonly known as the Pskem iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
