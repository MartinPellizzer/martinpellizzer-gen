    "intro": "Ixora littoralis, commonly known as the coastal ixora, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and mangrove areas. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Ixora littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
