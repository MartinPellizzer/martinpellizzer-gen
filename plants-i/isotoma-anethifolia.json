    "intro": "Isotoma anethifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Isotoma anethifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
