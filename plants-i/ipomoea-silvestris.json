    "intro": "Ipomoea silvestris, commonly known as the wild morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, typically blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it a common weed in disturbed soils. Botanically, it is characterized by its milky sap and distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds."
