    "intro": "Ischnanthus kagehensis, commonly known as the Kagehensean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high altitudes of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
