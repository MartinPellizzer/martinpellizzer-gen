    "intro": "Ilex decussata, commonly known as the Japanese holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex decussata thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and year-round foliage make it a valuable plant in both natural and cultivated environments."
