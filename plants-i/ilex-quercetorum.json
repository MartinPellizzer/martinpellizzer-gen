    "intro": "Ilex quercetorum, commonly known as the European holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are a food source for birds. Ilex quercetorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping due to its hardiness and year-round visual appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
