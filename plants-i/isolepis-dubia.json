It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed and have a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers that appear in late summer. Isolepis dubia plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
