    "intro": "Isotheca alba, commonly known as the white isotheca, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate white petals and unique leaf structure, which are adapted to its humid, tropical environment. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Isotheca alba has a slow growth rate and requires specific soil and light conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
