    "intro": "Inga pubiramea, commonly known as the silky inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant is notable for its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by pods that contain edible seeds. This species is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
