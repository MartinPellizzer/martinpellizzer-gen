It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oblong seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in certain environments."
