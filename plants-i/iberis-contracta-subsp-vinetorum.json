    "intro": "Iberis contracta subsp. vinetorum, commonly known as the purple flowering sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with prostrate stems and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
