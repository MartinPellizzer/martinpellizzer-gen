    "intro": "Indigofera diffusa, commonly known as wild indigo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, often branched stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are encased in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Indigofera diffusa is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
