It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and showy, blue to violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
