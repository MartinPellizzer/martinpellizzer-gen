    "intro": "Ichnanthus reclinatus, commonly known as the hanging lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in wet soils and absorb nutrients efficiently. Ichnanthus reclinatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
