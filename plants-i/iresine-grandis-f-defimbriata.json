It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety red or purple foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often used in horticultural displays for its intense coloration and visual appeal. It is typically propagated through stem cuttings to maintain the desired varietal characteristics."
