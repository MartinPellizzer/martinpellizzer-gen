    "intro": "Ipomoea mammosa, commonly known as the mammoth morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of purple, pink, or white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
