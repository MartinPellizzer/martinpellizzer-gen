    "intro": "Ischaemum tientaiense, commonly known as the Tiantai grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
