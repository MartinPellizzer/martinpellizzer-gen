    "intro": "Ipomoea pierrei, commonly known as the Hawaiian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and has a climbing habit, often found growing along forest edges or in disturbed areas. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, hence its common name. Ipomoea pierrei is also notable for its role in the traditional culture and ecology of Hawaii."
