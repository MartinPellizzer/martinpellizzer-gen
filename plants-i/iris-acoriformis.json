    "intro": "Iris acoriformis, commonly known as the slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers with three outer petals and three inner sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its striking appearance and ecological importance, it is a valued species in wetland restoration projects."
