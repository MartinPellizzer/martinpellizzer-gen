    "intro": "Inga pungens, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately compound, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests and secondary growth areas. Inga pungens is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it an important plant in agroforestry systems."
