    "intro": "Ipomoea barteri var. stenophylla, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and open in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert ecosystems."
