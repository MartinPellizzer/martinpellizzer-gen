    "intro": "Ilex integrifolia, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically entire, with no teeth or notches along the edges. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Ilex integrifolia is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
