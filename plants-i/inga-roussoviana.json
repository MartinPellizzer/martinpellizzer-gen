    "intro": "Inga roussoviana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. The tree's most notable feature is its heavy, woody pods that contain the edible Brazil nuts. It thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and requires a warm, tropical climate. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is often found in protected areas and is a key species in rainforest ecosystems."
