    "intro": "Ilex quitensis, commonly known as the Quitense holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Ilex quitensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for horticultural cultivation in regions with a similar climate."
