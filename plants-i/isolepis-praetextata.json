    "intro": "Isolepis praetextata, commonly known as the red-stemmed tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often display a reddish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its structural resilience. Isolepis praetextata is often found in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
