    "intro": "Inga flagelliformis, commonly known as the silky tree or silky inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often hanging stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are typically compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Inga flagelliformis is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
