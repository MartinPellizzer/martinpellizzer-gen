    "intro": "Isoetes tuberculata, commonly known as the spiny water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing spathes that are often adorned with small, tuberculate (knob-like) structures. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to the substrate. Its leaves are long and strap-like, emerging from a central stem and forming a rosette-like structure. Isoetes tuberculata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
