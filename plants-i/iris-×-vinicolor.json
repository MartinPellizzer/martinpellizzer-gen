    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 vinicolor, commonly known as the purple flag iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris germanica and Iris sibirica. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a white or pale yellow center, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring sword-shaped, dark green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its tall, upright growth habit and the vivid color of its blooms."
