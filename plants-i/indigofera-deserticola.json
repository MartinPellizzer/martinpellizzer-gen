    "intro": "Indigofera deserticola, commonly known as desert indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showing adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought-prone areas. Indigofera deserticola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
