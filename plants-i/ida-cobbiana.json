    "intro": "Ida cobbiana, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Ida cobbiana plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
