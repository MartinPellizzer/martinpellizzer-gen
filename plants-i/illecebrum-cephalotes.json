    "intro": "Illecebrum cephalotes, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue, typically blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth habit allows it to cover surfaces quickly, making it both ornamental and invasive in some areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water sources."
