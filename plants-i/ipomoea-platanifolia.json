    "intro": "Ipomoea platanifolia, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant is a climbing vine that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, using its tendrils to ascend supports. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
