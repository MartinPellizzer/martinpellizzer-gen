    "intro": "Icica obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate icica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
