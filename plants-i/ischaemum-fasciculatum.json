    "intro": "Ischaemum fasciculatum, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and forest edges, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has slender, erect stems that are usually less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-rowed spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Ischaemum fasciculatum is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
