    "intro": "Impatiens kwaiensis, commonly known as the Kwa\u00ef Forest Impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically come in shades of pink and white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is often found growing in the understorey of dense forests, where it relies on shade and consistent moisture for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
