    "intro": "Ipomoea mestecensis, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering vine native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to 10 meters in length, making it an aggressive climber. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
