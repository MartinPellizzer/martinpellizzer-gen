    "intro": "Isodon websteri, commonly known as the Webster's isodon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isodon websteri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
