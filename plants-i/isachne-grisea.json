    "intro": "Isachne grisea, commonly known as gray isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a silvery or grayish hue. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Isachne grisea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
