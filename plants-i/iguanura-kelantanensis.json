It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-rich soils of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
