    "intro": "Iris crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The leaves are broad, sword-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry meadows and grasslands. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
