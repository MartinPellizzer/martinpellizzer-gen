    "intro": "Incarvillea parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic incarvillea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often found in association with specific host species in desert environments."
