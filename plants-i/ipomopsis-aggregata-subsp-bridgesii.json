    "intro": "Ipomopsis aggregata subsp. bridgesii, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is noted for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
