    "intro": "Iridorkis falconeri, commonly known as the Falkland Islands orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Falkland Islands. It is characterized by its unique, delicate orchid-like flowers with a striking violet hue. The plant thrives in the cool, temperate climate of its coastal habitat. It has small, strap-shaped leaves and produces blooms primarily during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
