    "intro": "Icica goudotiana, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along a single stem. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the dense rainforests of Madagascar. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the forest floor, and it has adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Icica goudotiana is considered an endangered species."
