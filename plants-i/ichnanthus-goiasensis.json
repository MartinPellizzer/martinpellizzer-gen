    "intro": "Ichnanthus goiasensis, commonly known as the Goi\u00e1s spider-orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
