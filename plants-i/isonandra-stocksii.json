It is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has a woody stem and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in arid climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
