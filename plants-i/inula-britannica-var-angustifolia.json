It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and yellow composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant has lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. Its flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
