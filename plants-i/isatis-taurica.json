    "intro": "Isatis taurica, commonly known as Taurian woad, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppes and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly bitter taste, while its blue or purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Isatis taurica has been historically used for its dye-producing properties, similar to other members of its genus."
