    "intro": "Ionoxalis primavera, commonly known as the spring wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish tinge at the base, and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that suppress weeds. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
