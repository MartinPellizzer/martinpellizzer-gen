    "intro": "Ilex matanoana, commonly known as the Matanoan holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for certain bird species. Ilex matanoana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
