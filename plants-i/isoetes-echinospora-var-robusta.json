    "intro": "Isoetes echinospora var. robusta, commonly known as the robust spiny watermace, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, spiny structure known as a sorus. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the sporangia are often found at the water's surface. This variety is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to varying water conditions."
