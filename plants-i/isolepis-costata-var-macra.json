    "intro": "Isolepis costata var. macra, commonly known as the broad-leaved spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a grass-like appearance with narrow, flat leaves. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of its stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Isolepis costata var. macra plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
