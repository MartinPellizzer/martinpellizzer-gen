    "intro": "Ida lata, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Ida lata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of light conditions."
