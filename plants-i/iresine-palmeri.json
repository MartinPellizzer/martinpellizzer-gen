    "intro": "Iresine palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's bloodleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, vividly colored foliage, which often features red, purple, or pink hues on the undersides of the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Iresine palmeri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage, which can be used to add visual interest to gardens and landscapes."
