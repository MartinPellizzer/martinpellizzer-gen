    "intro": "Iguanura perdana, commonly known as the Perdana's iguana, is a rare and elusive species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Iguanidae and is characterized by its vibrant green coloration and distinctive, elongated body structure. The plant's botanical features include a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
