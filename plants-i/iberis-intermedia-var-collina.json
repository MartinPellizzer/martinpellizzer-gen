    "intro": "Iberis intermedia var. collina, commonly known as the coastal candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with gray-green foliage that is covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray make it a popular choice for coastal ornamental gardening."
