It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. It blooms early in the growing season, usually from late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
