    "intro": "Ischaemum repens, commonly known as creeping dogstail, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and wetlands. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, characteristic of the grass family. Ischaemum repens is often found in open habitats and can tolerate a range of soil conditions."
