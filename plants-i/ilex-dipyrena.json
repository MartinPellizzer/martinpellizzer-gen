    "intro": "Ilex dipyrena, commonly known as the Pyrenean holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex dipyrena thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler regions."
