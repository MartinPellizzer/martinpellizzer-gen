    "intro": "Isotoma longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its flowers are typically borne on short, upright stems and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Isotoma longiflora is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy substrates."
