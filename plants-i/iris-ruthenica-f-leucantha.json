    "intro": "Iris ruthenica f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered iris, is a botanical variant of the Siberian iris. It is characterized by its striking white petals and pale blue sepals, which distinguish it from the typical purple-flowered form. This plant is native to the colder regions of Eastern Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, grass-like leaves. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural habitats."
