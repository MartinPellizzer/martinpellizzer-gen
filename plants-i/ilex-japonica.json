    "intro": "Ilex japonica, commonly known as Japanese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring dense, dark green leaves that are glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Ilex japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its evergreen foliage and seasonal interest. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
