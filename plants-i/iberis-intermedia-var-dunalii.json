    "intro": "Iberis intermedia var. dunalii, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, rounded, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in coastal areas."
