    "intro": "Ipomoea dubia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth habit makes it an invasive species in some regions. Ipomoea dubia is also notable for its ability to climb and spread through both vegetative growth and seed dispersal."
