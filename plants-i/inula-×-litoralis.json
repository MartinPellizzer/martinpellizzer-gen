    "intro": "Inula \u00d7 litoralis, commonly known as the sea inula, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Inula crassifolia and Inula rugosa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its robust, branched stems and large, showy yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils and tolerating salt spray. Its foliage consists of alternate, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The sea inula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes in coastal ecosystems."
