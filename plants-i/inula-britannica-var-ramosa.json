    "intro": "Inula britannica var. ramosa, commonly known as the British Inula, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, branched stems, which give it its varietal name \"ramosa.\" The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, oval seeds in its composite flower heads. This variety is relatively rare and is considered a priority for conservation due to its limited distribution."
