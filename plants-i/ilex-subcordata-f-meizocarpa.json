    "intro": "Ilex subcordata f. meizocarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited holly, is a variant of the evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight indentation at the base. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, distinguishing it from other holly species. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and winter interest."
