It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and basal leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native range."
