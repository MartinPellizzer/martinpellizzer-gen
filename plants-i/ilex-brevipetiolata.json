    "intro": "Ilex brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-stemmed holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are short-petioled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex brevipetiolata typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
