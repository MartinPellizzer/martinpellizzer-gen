    "intro": "Isolepis bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Isolepis bulbosa typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the structure of its habitat."
