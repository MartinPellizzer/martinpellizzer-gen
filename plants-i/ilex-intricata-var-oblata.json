It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and winter hardiness make it suitable for use as a hedge or foundation plant."
