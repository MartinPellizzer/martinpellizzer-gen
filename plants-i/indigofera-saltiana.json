    "intro": "Indigofera saltiana, commonly known as saltbush indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. It often grows in coastal areas and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness. The seeds of Indigofera saltiana are encased in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
