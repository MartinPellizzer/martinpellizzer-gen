    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 seminaturalis, commonly known as the Seminatural Iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris sibirica and Iris germanica. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting showy, six-petaled flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its foliage consists of sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. The Seminatural Iris is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in naturalized settings due to its hardiness and adaptability."
