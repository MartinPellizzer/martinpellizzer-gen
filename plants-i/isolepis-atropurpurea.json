    "intro": "Isolepis atropurpurea, commonly known as black-root bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and dark purple stems, which are often mistaken for roots. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps that help stabilize shoreline ecosystems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Isolepis atropurpurea plays an important role in wetland habitats by providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
