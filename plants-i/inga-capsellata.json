    "intro": "Inga capsellata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often pubescent, giving the plant a velvety texture. The flowers are small, fragrant, and borne in clusters, typically appearing before the leaves fully develop. The fruit is a pod-like structure that contains several seeds, and it matures to a yellowish or reddish color. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible seeds and nitrogen-fixing properties."
