    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum var. arfakense, commonly known as the Arfak mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the highland regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
