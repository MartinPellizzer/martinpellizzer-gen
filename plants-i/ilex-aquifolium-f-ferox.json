    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium f. ferox, commonly known as the serrated holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its sharply toothed leaves. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in woodland and shrubland habitats. Its leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for birds. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature in temperate climates."
