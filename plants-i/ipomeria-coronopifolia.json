    "intro": "Ipomeria coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or desert dandelion, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a woody stem with dense clusters of small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its succulent-like leaves store moisture, enabling it to survive prolonged droughts. Ipomeria coronopifolia is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
