    "intro": "Isolepis kernii, commonly known as the California marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Isolepis kernii is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats."
