    "intro": "Ischarum lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Ischarum lehmannii is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment."
