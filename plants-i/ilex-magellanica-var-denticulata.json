    "intro": "Ilex magellanica var. denticulata, commonly known as the Magellan holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to South America. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves with distinctive notched margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Its dense foliage makes it an excellent choice for hedging or as a specimen plant in landscaping."
