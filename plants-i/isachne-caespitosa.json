    "intro": "Isachne caespitosa, commonly known as tufted isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It forms dense, compact clumps with slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in wetland gardens."
