    "intro": "Indigofera oroboides, commonly known as the African indigo or wild indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compound leaves and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, often found in savannas and woodland areas. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
