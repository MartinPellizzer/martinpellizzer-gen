    "intro": "Ilex ignicola, commonly known as the fireleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, dark green, leathery leaves that turn reddish or bronze in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex ignicola thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in arid regions."
