It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white center. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces sword-shaped, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The hybrid nature of Iris \u00d7 barthii results from crosses between different iris species, contributing to its diverse floral characteristics."
