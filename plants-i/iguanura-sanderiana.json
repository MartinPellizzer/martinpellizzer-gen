    "intro": "Iguanura sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's iguana tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
