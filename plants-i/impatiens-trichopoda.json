    "intro": "Impatiens trichopoda, commonly known as the hairy impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
