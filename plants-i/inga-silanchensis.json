    "intro": "Inga silanchensis, commonly known as the silanchensis inga, is a species of legume native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing pods that contain edible seeds. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in forest ecosystems."
