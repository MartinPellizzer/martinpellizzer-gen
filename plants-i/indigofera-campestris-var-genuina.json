    "intro": "Indigofera campestris var. genuina, commonly known as the wild indigo, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces pods containing small, dark seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
