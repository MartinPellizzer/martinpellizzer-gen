    "intro": "Iresine polymorpha var. alopecuroidea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red leaf plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, velvety leaves that range from deep red to purple, often with contrasting white or silver veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically pink or red, which appear in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant color and textural appeal."
