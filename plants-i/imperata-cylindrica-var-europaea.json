It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs and wet meadows. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a cotton ball, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species is also known for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
