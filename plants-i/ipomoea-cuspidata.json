    "intro": "Ipomoea cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along fences, walls, or in shaded woodland areas. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it both ornamental and invasive in certain regions. The seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiky capsule that aids in seed dispersal."
