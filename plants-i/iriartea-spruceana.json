    "intro": "Iriartea spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's puya, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a unique appearance. Iriartea spruceana is adapted to grow in high-altitude, humid environments with well-drained soil."
