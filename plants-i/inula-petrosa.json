    "intro": "Inula petrosa, commonly known as rock immortelle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a robust stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its most distinctive feature is its bright yellow flower heads, which consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Inula petrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional herbal medicine."
