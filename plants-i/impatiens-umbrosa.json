    "intro": "Impatiens umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant prefers shady, humid environments and thrives in partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its flowers bloom throughout the rainy season and are pollinated primarily by insects. Impatiens umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add color to shaded areas in gardens."
