    "intro": "Ilex spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its spiny, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex spinulosa typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 15 feet. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
