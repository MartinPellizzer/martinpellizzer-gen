    "intro": "Ilex serrata var. subtilis, commonly known as the Japanese holly or Japanese winterberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its ability to retain its berries through winter adds visual interest to gardens throughout the colder seasons."
