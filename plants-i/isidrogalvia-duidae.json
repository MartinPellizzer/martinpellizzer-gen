    "intro": "Isidrogalvia duidae, commonly known as the Duidae's isidrogalvian, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
