    "intro": "Isocoma, commonly known as desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a single head, resembling those of the dandelion. Isocoma species are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. They play a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
