    "intro": "Indigofera pendula var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf climbing indigo, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and pairs of oval, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its lush foliage. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can also be beneficial in soil enrichment."
