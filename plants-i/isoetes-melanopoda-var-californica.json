It belongs to the genus Isoetes, which includes species commonly referred to as \"marmots\" due to their leaf-like structures. This variety is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like leaves that form a mat on the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic organisms."
