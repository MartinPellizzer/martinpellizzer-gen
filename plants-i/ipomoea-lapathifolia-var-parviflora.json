    "intro": "Ipomoea lapathifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or as a ground cover in gardens."
