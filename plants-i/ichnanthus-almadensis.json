    "intro": "Ichnanthus almadensis, commonly known as the Almaden beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ichnanthus almadensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
