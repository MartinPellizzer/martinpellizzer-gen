It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are usually ovate and covered in a fine pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss.
