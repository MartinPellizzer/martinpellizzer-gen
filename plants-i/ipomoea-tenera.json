    "intro": "Ipomoea tenera, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
