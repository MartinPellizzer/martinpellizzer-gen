    "intro": "Illipe ramiflora, commonly known as the yellow illipe tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dense canopy of elliptical, leathery leaves. The tree produces yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing oily seeds. These seeds are valued for their high oil content, used in traditional medicine and as a source of culinary oil. The plant thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in mixed dipterocarp forests."
