    "intro": "Ilex serrata, commonly known as the serrated holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Ilex serrata typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
