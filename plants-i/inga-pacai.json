    "intro": "Inga pacai, commonly known as pac\u00e1, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant is notable for its edible fruit, which has a unique, nutty flavor and is often consumed raw or processed into beverages. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous pod, and the tree plays an important ecological role in nitrogen fixation. Inga pacai is also valued for its potential in agroforestry systems due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
