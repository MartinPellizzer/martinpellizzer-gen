It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters throughout the year. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Iphisia multiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
