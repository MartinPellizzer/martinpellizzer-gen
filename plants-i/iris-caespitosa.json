    "intro": "Iris caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grass-like basal leaves and upright flowering stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which help stabilize soil in its native environment. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
