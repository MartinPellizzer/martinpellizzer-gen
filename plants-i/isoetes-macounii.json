It is characterized by its spore-bearing leaves that are typically submerged in water, with the sporophylls forming a distinct, often spiraled structure. The plant is native to North America, particularly found in freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
