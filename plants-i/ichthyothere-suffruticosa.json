    "intro": "Ichthyothere suffruticosa, commonly known as the waterberry shrub, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a sprawling, woody stem that often grows close to the ground, forming dense clusters. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by bright red berries that mature in the fall. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a glossy surface, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to saturated soil conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
