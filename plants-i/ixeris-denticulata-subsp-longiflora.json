    "intro": "Ixeris denticulata subsp. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in loose inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
