    "intro": "Iberis saxatilis var. corifolia, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of small, bright green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
