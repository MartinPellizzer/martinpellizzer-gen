    "intro": "Illigera cava, commonly known as the desert broom, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, woody stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. Illigera cava is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
