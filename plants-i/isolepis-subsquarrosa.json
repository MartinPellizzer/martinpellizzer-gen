    "intro": "Isolepis subsquarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystem health. Isolepis subsquarrosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
