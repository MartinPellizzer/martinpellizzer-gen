    "intro": "Ivesia chaetophora, commonly known as the hairy ivesia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, woody fruits called achenes. Ivesia chaetophora is often found in chaparral and sagebrush communities, contributing to local biodiversity."
