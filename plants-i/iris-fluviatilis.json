    "intro": "Iris fluviatilis, commonly known as the river iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three downward-curving sepals. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Iris fluviatilis plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
