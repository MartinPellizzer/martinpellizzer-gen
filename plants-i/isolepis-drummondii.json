    "intro": "Isolepis drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, thread-like leaves that are often difficult to distinguish from other sedges. Its flowering spikes are usually borne in clusters at the base of the plant, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis drummondii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
