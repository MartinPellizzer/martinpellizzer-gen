    "intro": "Inga pruriens, commonly known as the \"itching bean,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important species in agroforestry systems. However, its common name reflects the irritant properties of its foliage, which can cause allergic reactions in some individuals."
