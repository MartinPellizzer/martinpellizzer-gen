    "intro": "Iris psammocola, commonly known as the sand iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with its deep root system. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three petals and three sepals. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone soils. Iris psammocola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
