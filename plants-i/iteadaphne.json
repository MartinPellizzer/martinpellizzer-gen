It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in wetlands and slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can be pink, white, or yellow, and its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. Iteadaphne has a long history of cultural and religious significance, especially in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
