    "intro": "Ilex vesparum, commonly known as the honeycomb holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are often arranged in a distinctive, clustered pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex vesparum is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
