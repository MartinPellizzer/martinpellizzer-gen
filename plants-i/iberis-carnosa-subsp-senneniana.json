    "intro": "Iberis carnosa subsp. senneniana, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are lobed and hairy, and its stems are usually covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
