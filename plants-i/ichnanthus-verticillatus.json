It features small, delicate flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in small, capsule-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
