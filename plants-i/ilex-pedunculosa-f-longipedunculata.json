    "intro": "Ilex pedunculosa f. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled holly, is a variant of the holly genus characterized by its elongated peduncles. This plant is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States, typically found in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, with spiny margins, and it produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds. The extended peduncles distinguish this form from typical Ilex pedunculosa, making it a notable botanical feature. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
