It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or orange throat. The plant produces long, slender stems that bear clusters of flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are strap-like and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
