    "intro": "Indigofera enonensis, commonly known as the African indigo plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant has been historically used for its dye-producing properties, although its ornamental value is also recognized in horticulture."
