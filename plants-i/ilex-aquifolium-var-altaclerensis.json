    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. altaclerensis, commonly known as the Scottish holly, is a variant of the common holly native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves with spiny margins, which are typically glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, red berries in the winter, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along rocky outcrops. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
