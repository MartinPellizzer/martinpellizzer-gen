    "intro": "Indigofera perrieri subsp. polymorpha, commonly known as the variable indigofera, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, often blue or purple flowers. The plant is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flowering patterns, which contribute to its subspecific classification. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
