    "intro": "Ipomoea calva, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides or in open woodlands. Ipomoea calva is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed due to its invasive potential in certain regions."
