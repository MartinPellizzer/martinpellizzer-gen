    "intro": "Ivodea alata, commonly known as winged ivy, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Ivodea alata is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and rapid growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some regions."
