    "intro": "Ilex foxworthyi, commonly known as the Foxworth yew, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Aquifoliaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, dark berries. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive elliptical shape with serrated margins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
