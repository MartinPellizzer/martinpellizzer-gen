    "intro": "Ilex vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to the volcanic soils of Hawaii. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red berries. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of volcanic regions. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for native birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex vulcanicola is considered a vulnerable species."
