    "intro": "Iberis latealata, commonly known as the woolly candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate ornamental touch to gardens. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Iberis latealata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
