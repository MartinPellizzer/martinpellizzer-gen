    "intro": "Isolepis subcucullata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis subcucullata thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life highlights its ecological significance."
