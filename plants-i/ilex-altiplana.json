    "intro": "Ilex altiplana, commonly known as the Andean holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Ilex altiplana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to the challenging conditions of the Andean altiplano."
