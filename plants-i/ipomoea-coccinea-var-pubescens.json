    "intro": "Ipomoea coccinea var. pubescens, commonly known as the Crimson Crown or red morning glory, is a strikingly beautiful vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a pubescent (hairy) texture, which is a key trait of its varietal name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often climbing supports as it grows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
