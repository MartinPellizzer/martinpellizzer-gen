    "intro": "Indigofera oligantha, commonly known as the small indigo or narrow-leaved indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive blue or purple hue. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. Indigofera oligantha is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
