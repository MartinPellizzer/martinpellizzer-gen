    "intro": "Ilex robusta, commonly known as the Brazilian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its year-round foliage and seasonal blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of climates."
