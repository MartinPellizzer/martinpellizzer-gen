    "intro": "Ipomoea biglandulosa, commonly known as the large-fruited morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces large, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
