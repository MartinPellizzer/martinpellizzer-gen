    "intro": "Iliamna angulata, commonly known as the Alaskan sedge, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wet, peaty soils and is often found in tundra and moist meadow habitats. Iliamna angulata produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment. It is an important component of the plant community in its native range."
