    "intro": "Impatiens eryaleia subsp. gigantea, commonly known as the giant water impatiens, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often floating on the water surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for water gardens and pond landscaping."
