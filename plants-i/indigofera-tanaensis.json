    "intro": "Indigofera tanaensis, commonly known as the African indigo plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Indigofera tanaensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some regions."
