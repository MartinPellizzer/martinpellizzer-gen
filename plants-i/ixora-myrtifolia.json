    "intro": "Ixora myrtifolia, commonly known as the red torch or flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Ixora myrtifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hedge due to its vibrant flowers and hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes."
