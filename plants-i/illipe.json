    "intro": "Illipe, commonly known as *Elaeocarpus dulcis*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. The fruit's hard outer shell encases a single, oily seed, which is the primary source of illipe oil. This oil is valued for its high content of essential fatty acids and is used in both culinary and cosmetic applications."
