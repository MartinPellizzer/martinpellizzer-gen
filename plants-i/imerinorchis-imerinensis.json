    "intro": "Imerinorchis imerinensis, commonly known as the Eritrean orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Eritrea. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
