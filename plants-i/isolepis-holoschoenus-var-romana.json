    "intro": "Isolepis holoschoenus var. romana, commonly known as the Roman bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are narrow and flat, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
