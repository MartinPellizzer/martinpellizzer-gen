It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
