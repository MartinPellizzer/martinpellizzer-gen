    "intro": "Impatiens setacea, commonly known as the hairy impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Impatiens setacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
