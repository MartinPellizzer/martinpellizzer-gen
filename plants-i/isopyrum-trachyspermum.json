    "intro": "Isopyrum trachyspermum, commonly known as the rough sarsaparilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, and it produces berries that are edible but often have a strong, bitter taste. Isopyrum trachyspermum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
