    "intro": "Isolepis modesta, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It has slender, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. Isolepis modesta plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
