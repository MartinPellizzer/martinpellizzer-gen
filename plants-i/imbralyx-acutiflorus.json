    "intro": "Imbralyx acutiflorus, commonly known as the sharpflower fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
