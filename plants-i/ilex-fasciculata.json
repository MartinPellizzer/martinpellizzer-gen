    "intro": "Ilex fasciculata, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which consists of small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Ilex fasciculata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form thick, compact clusters."
