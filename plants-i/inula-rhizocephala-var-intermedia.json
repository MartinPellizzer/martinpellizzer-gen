    "intro": "Inula rhizocephala var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate elecampane, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features a robust rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize various habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This variant is often found in moist meadows and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
