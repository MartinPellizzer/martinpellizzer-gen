    "intro": "Ilex truxillensis, commonly known as the Truxillense Holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, specifically found in parts of Cuba and the Isle of Pines. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex truxillensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
