    "intro": "Ipomoea polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces numerous small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
