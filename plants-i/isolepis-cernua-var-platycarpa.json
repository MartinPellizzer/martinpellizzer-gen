    "intro": "Isolepis cernua var. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. Its fruiting structures are distinctive, with broad, flattened capsules that aid in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
