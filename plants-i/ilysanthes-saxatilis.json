    "intro": "Ilysanthes saxatilis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal environments. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal cliffs, sea stacks, and other rocky habitats. Ilysanthes saxatilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its specialized environment."
