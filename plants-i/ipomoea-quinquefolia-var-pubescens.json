    "intro": "Ipomoea quinquefolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its varietal name. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, opening in the morning. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in cultivated areas."
