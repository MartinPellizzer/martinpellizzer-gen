It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Isolepis puberula produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the sedge family."
