    "intro": "Indigofera tinctoria var. tinctoria, commonly known as true indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant is notable for its rich source of indigoid compounds, which have been historically used to produce the deep blue dye indigo. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a rough texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
