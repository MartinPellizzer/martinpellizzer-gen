    "intro": "Ilex hylonoma var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth evergreen holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are smooth to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name \"glabra.\" The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
