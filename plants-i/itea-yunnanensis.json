    "intro": "Itea yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan water-leaf, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the Hydrangaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and unique foliage structure."
