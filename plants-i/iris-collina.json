The plant features upright, slender stems that bear showy blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often covered in a fine, silvery down. Iris collina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
