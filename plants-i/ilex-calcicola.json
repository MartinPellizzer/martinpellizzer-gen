    "intro": "Ilex calcicola, commonly known as the limestone holly, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant has small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Ilex calcicola is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
