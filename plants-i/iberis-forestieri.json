    "intro": "Iberis forestieri, commonly known as the alpine candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, drought-tolerant plants."
