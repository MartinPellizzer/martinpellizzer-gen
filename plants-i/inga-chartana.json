    "intro": "Inga chartana, commonly known as the yellow inga, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval and slightly hairy. Inga chartana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
