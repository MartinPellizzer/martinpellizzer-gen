    "intro": "Ipomoea polymorpha var. elliptica, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas. The flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated primarily by insects."
