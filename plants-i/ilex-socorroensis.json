    "intro": "Ilex socorroensis, commonly known as Socorro holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Ilex socorroensis is considered an endangered species."
