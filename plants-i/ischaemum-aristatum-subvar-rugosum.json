    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum subvar. rugosum, commonly known as the roughhair barnyardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as fields, roadsides, and agricultural areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. This species is often considered a weed in cultivated lands due to its competitive growth habit and adaptability."
