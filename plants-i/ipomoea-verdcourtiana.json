    "intro": "Ipomoea verdcourtiana, commonly known as the Verdcourt's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
