It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with high humidity and partial shade. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a climbing or shrub-like growth habit. Indigofera umbraticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
