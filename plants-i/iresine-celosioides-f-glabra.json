    "intro": "Iresine celosioides f. glabra, commonly known as the velvetleaf or smoothleaf iron plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep red to purple, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in warm, humid climates. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies mainly in its horticultural appeal."
