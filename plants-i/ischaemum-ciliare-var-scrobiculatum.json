It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in temperate regions."
