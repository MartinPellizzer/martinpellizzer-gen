    "intro": "Ilex hylonoma var. hylonoma, commonly known as the Hylonome holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean islands. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in coastal areas or mountainous regions. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and year-round greenery."
