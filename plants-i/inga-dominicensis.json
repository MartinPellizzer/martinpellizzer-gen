    "intro": "Inga dominicensis, commonly known as the Dominican inga, is a species of legume native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its pinnate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Inga dominicensis plays an important ecological role in nitrogen fixation and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species."
