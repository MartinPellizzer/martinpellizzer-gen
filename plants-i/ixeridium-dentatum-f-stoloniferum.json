    "intro": "Ixeridium dentatum f. stoloniferum, commonly known as the stoloniferous pincushion grass, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the daisy family. Its stoloniferous form means it spreads via runners, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
