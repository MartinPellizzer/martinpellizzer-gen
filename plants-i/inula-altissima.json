    "intro": "Inula altissima, commonly known as the greater mullein, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces large, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered with dense, woolly hairs. Inula altissima is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats."
