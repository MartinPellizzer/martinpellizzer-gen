    "intro": "Ipomoea hastata, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blooms that open in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ipomoea hastata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can climb trellises or fences with its strong, twining stems."
