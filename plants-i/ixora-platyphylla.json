    "intro": "Ixora platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed ixora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often cultivated as an ornamental shrub. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year, adding vibrant color to gardens. Its leaves are broad and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the colorful blooms. Ixora platyphylla is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes."
