    "intro": "Iris nazarena, commonly known as the Armenian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three downward-curled sepals. The plant typically grows to a height of 60 to 100 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture. Iris nazarena is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
