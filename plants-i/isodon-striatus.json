    "intro": "Isodon striatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and possesses lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Isodon striatus is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties and is also used in ornamental gardening."
