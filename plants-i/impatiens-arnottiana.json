    "intro": "Impatiens arnottiana, commonly known as the New Zealand impatiens, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when disturbed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native habitat."
