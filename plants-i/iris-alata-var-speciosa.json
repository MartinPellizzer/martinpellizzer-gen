    "intro": "Iris alata var. speciosa, commonly known as the showy iris, is a striking ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of vibrant blue to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and rockeries. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
