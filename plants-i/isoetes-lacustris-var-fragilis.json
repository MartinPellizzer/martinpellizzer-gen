    "intro": "Isoetes lacustris var. fragilis, commonly known as the fragile water clubmoss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its slender, spore-bearing stems that grow submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, delicate sporangia that release spores into the water, facilitating its reproduction. It typically thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft substrates. Due to its fragile nature, it is often found in sheltered areas where it is less exposed to strong currents."
