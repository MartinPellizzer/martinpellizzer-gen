    "intro": "Isometrum leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers with white petals and a yellow throat. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or borders. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, spring-blooming flowers."
