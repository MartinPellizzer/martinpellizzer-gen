    "intro": "Ichnocarpus, commonly known as the \"burr bean\" or \"devil's bean,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. Ichnocarpus species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are usually pinnate, and the flowers are small and clustered in racemes. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as sources of tannins."
