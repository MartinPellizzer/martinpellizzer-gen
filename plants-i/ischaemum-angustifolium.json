    "intro": "Ischaemum angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Ischaemum angustifolium is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
