    "intro": "Ipomoea amplexicaulis, commonly known as the leafy morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, often velvety leaves that wrap around its stems, giving it its scientific name \"amplexicaulis,\" meaning \"embrace the stem.\" The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
