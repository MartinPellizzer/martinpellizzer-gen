    "intro": "Imperatoria dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian spurge, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems and alternate, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening in cooler regions."
