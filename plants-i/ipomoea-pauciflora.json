It produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is characterized by its rapid growth habit. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Ipomoea pauciflora is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many other species of morning glories."
