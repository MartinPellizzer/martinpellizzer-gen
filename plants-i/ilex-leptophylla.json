    "intro": "Ilex leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex leptophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a humid climate."
