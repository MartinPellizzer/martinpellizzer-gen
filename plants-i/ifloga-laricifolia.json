    "intro": "Ifloga laricifolia, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tall stature and smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
