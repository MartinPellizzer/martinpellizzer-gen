It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Ischaemum pubescens is adapted to temperate climates and is known for its resilience in poor soil conditions."
