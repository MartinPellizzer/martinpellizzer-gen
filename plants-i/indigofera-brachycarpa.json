    "intro": "Indigofera brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has been used traditionally for its dye-producing properties, though its botanical significance lies in its role as a nitrogen-fixing species in ecosystems."
