    "intro": "Iris auranitica var. unicolor, commonly known as the golden iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer and feature a unique, unicolored pattern without the typical purple or blue hues seen in other iris varieties. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
