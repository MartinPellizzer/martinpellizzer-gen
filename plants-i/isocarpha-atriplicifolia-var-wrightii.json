    "intro": "Isocarpha atriplicifolia var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are bluish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is notable for its unique seed structure, with small, bladder-like capsules that aid in seed dispersal."
