    "intro": "Ilex latifolia var. subrugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The rough texture of its leaves distinguishes it from other holly varieties."
