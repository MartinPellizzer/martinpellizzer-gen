    "intro": "Ilex ligustrina var. typica, commonly known as the common holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically spiny and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental planting. Its hardy nature and seasonal color changes make it a notable plant in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
