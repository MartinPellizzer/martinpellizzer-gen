    "intro": "Indigofera subulata var. subulata, commonly known as the slender indigo or desert indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pea-shaped flowers that are typically pink or violet, blooming in spring or early summer. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited rainfall. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
