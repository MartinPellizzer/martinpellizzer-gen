    "intro": "Ilex championii, commonly known as the Arizona holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex championii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in desert regions."
