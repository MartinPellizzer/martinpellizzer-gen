    "intro": "Imbricaria pierrei, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue along the edges. The plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Imbricaria pierrei is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
