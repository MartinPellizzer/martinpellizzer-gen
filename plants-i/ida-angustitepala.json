    "intro": "Ida angustitepala, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ida, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Ida angustitepala is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
