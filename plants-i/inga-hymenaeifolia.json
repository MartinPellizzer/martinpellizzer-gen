    "intro": "Inga hymenaeifolia, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a useful species for soil stabilization and reforestation. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
