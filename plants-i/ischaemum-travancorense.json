    "intro": "Ischaemum travancorense, commonly known as Travancore grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Western Ghats of India. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, erect leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
