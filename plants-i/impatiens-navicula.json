    "intro": "Impatiens navicula, commonly known as the water impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common ornamental plant in wetland gardens. Botanically, it belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the seed pods explode upon maturity to scatter seeds."
