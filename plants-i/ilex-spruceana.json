    "intro": "Ilex spruceana, commonly known as the Spruceleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically a dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex spruceana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable climates."
