It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, which bloom in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Iris verna is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
