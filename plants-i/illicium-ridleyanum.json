    "intro": "Illicium ridleyanum, commonly known as Ridley's star anise, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Schisandraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the star anise. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers and has glossy, elliptical leaves. Its fruit, which is the main part used for its aromatic properties, contains tiny seeds enclosed in a dark, wrinkled pericarp. The plant is valued for its essential oils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
