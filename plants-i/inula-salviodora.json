    "intro": "Inula salviodora, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Inula salviodora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
