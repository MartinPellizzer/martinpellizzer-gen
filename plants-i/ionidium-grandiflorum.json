    "intro": "Ionidium grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered ionidium, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Ionidium grandiflorum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
