    "intro": "Indoneesiella longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled indonesian fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with long, slender peduncles. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
