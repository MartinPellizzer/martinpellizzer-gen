    "intro": "Ixia elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed flame lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with vibrant orange or red flowers that resemble flames. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of fleshy, modified leaves. Ixia elongata is valued in horticulture for its dramatic floral display and is often cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
