It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat and blade-like, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. Isolepis planifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
