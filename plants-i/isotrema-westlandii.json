    "intro": "Isotrema westlandii, commonly known as the Westland mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees. It has small, leathery leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to some extent. It is often found in coastal and lowland forests, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Its presence can affect the growth and health of its host trees."
