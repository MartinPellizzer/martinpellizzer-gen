It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Iozoste sphaerocarpa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
