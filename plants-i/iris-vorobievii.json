It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with sword-shaped, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
