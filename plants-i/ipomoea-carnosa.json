    "intro": "Ipomoea carnosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is typically herbaceous, with a sprawling growth habit and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea carnosa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it thrives in warm, humid climates."
