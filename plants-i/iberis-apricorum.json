It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are rounded and hairy, and its stems are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its blooming period makes it an important early nectar source for pollinators."
