    "intro": "Ichnanthus tenuis, commonly known as the slender marsh wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils. Ichnanthus tenuis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
