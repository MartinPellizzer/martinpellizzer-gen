    "intro": "Ilex sulcata, commonly known as the Brazilian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex sulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and winter interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
