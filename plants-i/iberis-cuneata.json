It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
