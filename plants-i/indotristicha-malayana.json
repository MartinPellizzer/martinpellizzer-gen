    "intro": "Indotristicha malayana, commonly known as the Malayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
