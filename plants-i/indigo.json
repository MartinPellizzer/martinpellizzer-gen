    "intro": "Indigo, commonly known as *Indigofera* species, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Indigo is characterized by its striking blue flowers and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agricultural systems. The plant's leaves and stems are used to produce the dye indigo, which has been historically significant in textile industries. Its growth habits include both annual and perennial forms, depending on the species."
