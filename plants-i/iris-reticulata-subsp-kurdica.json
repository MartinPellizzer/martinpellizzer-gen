    "intro": "Iris reticulata subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish reticulate iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, hardy plants."
