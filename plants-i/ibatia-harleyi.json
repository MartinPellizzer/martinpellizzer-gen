    "intro": "Ibatia harleyi, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and overharvesting, Ibatia harleyi is listed as endangered in some regions."
