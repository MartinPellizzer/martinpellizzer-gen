    "intro": "Ilex confertifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, red berries that are produced in the fall. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Ilex confertifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
