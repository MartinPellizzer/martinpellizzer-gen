    "intro": "Ilex permicrophylla, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves that are densely packed and glossy. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for decorative purposes."
