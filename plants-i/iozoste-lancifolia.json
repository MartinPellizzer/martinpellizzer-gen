    "intro": "Iozoste lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iozoste, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Iozoste lancifolia thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
