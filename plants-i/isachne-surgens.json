    "intro": "Isachne surgens, commonly known as the creeping isachne, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its narrow leaves are usually less than 1 inch wide and have a smooth, grass-like texture. The small, spike-like inflorescence produces light green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
