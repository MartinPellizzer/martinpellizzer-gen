    "intro": "Ipomoea quinata, commonly known as the Japanese morning glory, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, purple, and white. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like fruit that splits open when mature. Ipomoea quinata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
