    "intro": "Ixeridium dentatum subsp. kitayamense, commonly known as the Japanese toothed fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which helps anchor it in soil and absorb nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
