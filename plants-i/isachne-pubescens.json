    "intro": "Isachne pubescens, commonly known as the hairy isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like clusters. Isachne pubescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
