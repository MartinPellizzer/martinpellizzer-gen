    "intro": "Iodes balansae, commonly known as the Balansae orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires specific humidity levels to flourish. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Iodes balansae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
