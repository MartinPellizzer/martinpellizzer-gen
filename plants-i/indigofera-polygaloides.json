It is native to Africa and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. It produces pods containing seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
