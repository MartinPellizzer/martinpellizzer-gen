    "intro": "Ipomoea setosa subsp. pavonii, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is typically herbaceous, with a sprawling growth habit and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed."
