    "intro": "Ipomoea bonariensis f. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf morning glory, is a variant of the species native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a vigorous climber with stems that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in gardens."
