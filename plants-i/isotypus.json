    "intro": "Isotypus, commonly known as the type species, refers to the original plant specimen used to describe a species in botanical nomenclature. It serves as the reference point for the scientific name of a species, ensuring consistency and accuracy in classification. The isotypus is often housed in a herbarium and is crucial for verifying the characteristics of the species. It may include multiple specimens collected from the same location and time as the holotype. Botanists rely on the isotypus to study variations and confirm the validity of species descriptions."
