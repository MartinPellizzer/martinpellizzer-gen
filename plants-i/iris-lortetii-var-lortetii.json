    "intro": "Iris lortetii var. lortetii, commonly known as the Lortet's iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with a distinct three-parted structure, characteristic of the iris family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
