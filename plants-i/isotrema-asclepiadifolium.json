    "intro": "Isotrema asclepiadifolium, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Isotrema asclepiadifolium produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, typical of the Apocynaceae family."
