    "intro": "Ixora macrothyrsa var. nitida, commonly known as the silver ixora, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange-red flowers throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
