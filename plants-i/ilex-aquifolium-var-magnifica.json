    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. magnifica, commonly known as the American holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and prominent white or yellow veins. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and hedges."
