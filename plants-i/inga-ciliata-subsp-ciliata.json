    "intro": "Inga ciliata subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet having a soft, silky texture due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
