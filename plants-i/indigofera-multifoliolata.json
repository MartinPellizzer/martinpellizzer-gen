    "intro": "Indigofera multifoliolata, commonly known as the multilobe indigo, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of multiple small leaflets arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often clustered in racemes. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
