    "intro": "Iberis linifolia subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the coastal candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has linear, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds."
