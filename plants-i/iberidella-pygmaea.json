    "intro": "Iberidella pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in coastal and inland regions, where it forms dense, mat-like growths. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with suitable conditions."
