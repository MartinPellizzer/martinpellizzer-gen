    "intro": "Iris officinalis, commonly known as the medicinal iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stems with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, upright flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes and roots have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Iris officinalis prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a common ornamental and medicinal plant in temperate regions."
