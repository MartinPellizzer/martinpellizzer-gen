    "intro": "Ifdregea montana, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is well adapted to cold and arid conditions, making it a characteristic species of alpine environments."
