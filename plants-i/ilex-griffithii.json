    "intro": "Ilex griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of northern India and Nepal. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and contribute to its ecological role in seed dispersal. Ilex griffithii typically grows in cool, moist habitats and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its winter interest and hardy nature."
