    "intro": "Inga byrsinocarpa, commonly known as the golden inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
