It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
