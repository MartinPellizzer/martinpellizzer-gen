    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. crenata, commonly known as Japanese holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, leathery foliage with serrated edges, typically ranging in color from dark green to glossy bronze. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds but not edible for humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appeal make it suitable for hedges, rock gardens, and container planting."
