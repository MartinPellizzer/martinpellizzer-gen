    "intro": "Iberis, commonly known as candytuft, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, tuft-like clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. They typically grow in a compact, shrub-like form with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Iberis species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Many varieties are hardy and suitable for rock gardens or as border plants."
