    "intro": "Imperatoria sylvestris, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths, woodland edges, and disturbed ground. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain water in arid conditions. Imperatoria sylvestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
