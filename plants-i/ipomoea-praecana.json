    "intro": "Ipomoea praecana, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a herbaceous vine that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically blooms in the early morning and closes its flowers by midday, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. Ipomoea praecana thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
