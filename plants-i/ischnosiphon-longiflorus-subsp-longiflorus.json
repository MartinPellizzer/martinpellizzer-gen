It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky areas.
