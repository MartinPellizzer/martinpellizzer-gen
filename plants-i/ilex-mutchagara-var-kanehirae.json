    "intro": "Ilex mutchagara var. kanehirae, commonly known as the Kanehirae holly, is a rare variant of the holly genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
