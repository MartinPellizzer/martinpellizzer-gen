    "intro": "Ipomoea capitata, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces edible tubers, though these are not commonly consumed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along riverbanks and in disturbed soils. Ipomoea capitata is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to climb using its twining stems."
