    "intro": "Iseilema prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate isehilema, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaping."
