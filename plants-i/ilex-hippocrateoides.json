    "intro": "Ilex hippocrateoides, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Ilex hippocrateoides is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife in its native ecosystems."
