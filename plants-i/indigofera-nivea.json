    "intro": "Indigofera nivea, commonly known as the white indigo or snow bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that turn brown as they mature, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Indigofera nivea is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
