    "intro": "Inula macrolepis, commonly known as the woolly elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green stems and large, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic, and often bitter tasting milky sap, which is a feature of the genus Inula. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its woolly appearance. Inula macrolepis is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
