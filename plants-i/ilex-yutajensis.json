    "intro": "Ilex yutajensis, commonly known as the Yutajensis holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
