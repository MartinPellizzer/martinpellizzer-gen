    "intro": "Inversodicraea kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon holly, is a shrub native to the rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features glossy, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
