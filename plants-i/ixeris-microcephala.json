    "intro": "Ixeris microcephala, commonly known as Chinese groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Ixeris microcephala is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
