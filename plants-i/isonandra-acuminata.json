    "intro": "Isonandra acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
