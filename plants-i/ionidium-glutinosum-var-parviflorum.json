    "intro": "Ionidium glutinosum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered stickyweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are covered in a sticky substance, which helps in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. This variety is noted for its aromatic foliage and is often found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere."
