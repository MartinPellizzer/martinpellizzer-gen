    "intro": "Ischnosiphon rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved ischnosiphon, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its rounded, palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its morphology suggests adaptations for shade tolerance and efficient water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
