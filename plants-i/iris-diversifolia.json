It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features grass-like basal leaves and striking, showy flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often in shades of blue, violet, or white. The species is noted for its variability in leaf shape and flower color, which contributes to its common name."
