    "intro": "Isolepis divaricata, commonly known as the variable bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and improve water retention in its habitat. It is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Isolepis divaricata plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland ecosystems."
