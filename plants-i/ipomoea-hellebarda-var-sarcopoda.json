    "intro": "Ipomoea hellebarda var. sarcopoda, commonly known as the red devil's trumpet, is a striking flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, pendulous, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, with a prominent yellow throat. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and velvety in texture. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, often climbing or trailing along supports. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some areas."
