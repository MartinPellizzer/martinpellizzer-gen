    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. opaca, commonly known as the dark-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The leaves are typically elliptical with spiny margins, and the plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening. The plant's compact growth habit and evergreen appearance make it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
