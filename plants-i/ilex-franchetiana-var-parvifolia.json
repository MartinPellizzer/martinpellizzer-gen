    "intro": "Ilex franchetiana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller and more ovate compared to typical holly species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
