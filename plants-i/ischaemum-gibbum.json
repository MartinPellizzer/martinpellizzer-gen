    "intro": "Ischaemum gibbum, commonly known as the hairy grass or slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. Ischaemum gibbum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
