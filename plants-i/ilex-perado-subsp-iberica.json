    "intro": "Ilex perado subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the Ilex genus."
