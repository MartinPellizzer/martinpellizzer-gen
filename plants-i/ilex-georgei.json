    "intro": "Ilex georgei, commonly known as the George's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex georgei thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas within forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
