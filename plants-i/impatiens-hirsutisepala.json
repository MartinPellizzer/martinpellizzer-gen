    "intro": "Impatiens hirsutisepala, commonly known as the hairy-sepaled impatiens, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The sepals of this plant are notably hairy, giving it its scientific name, and they often persist on the flower after blooming. The leaves are typically ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, elliptical fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
