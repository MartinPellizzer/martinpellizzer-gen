    "intro": "Isolepis echinulata, commonly known as the prickly flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to spread and colonize disturbed wetlands. Isolepis echinulata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
