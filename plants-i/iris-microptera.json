It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Iris microptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
