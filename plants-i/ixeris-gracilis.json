    "intro": "Ixeris gracilis, commonly known as slender marshwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Ixeris gracilis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
