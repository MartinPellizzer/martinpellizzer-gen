    "intro": "Isolepis aucklandica, commonly known as the Auckland flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-angled berries. Isolepis aucklandica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
