It features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its botanical name honors the botanist Friedrich von Reichenbach, while the variety name 'alba' refers to its pale or white flower color.
