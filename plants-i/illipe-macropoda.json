    "intro": "Illipe macropoda, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that give way to oval, woody fruits containing a rich, creamy seed kernel. The seeds are widely used to make shea butter, a valuable cosmetic and industrial product. Its ecological and economic importance makes it a significant species in its native habitats."
