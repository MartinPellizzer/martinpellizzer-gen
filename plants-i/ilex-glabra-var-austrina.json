It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are usually leathery and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. This species is often used in landscaping for its evergreen foliage and ornamental value."
