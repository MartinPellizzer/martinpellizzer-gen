    "intro": "Ilex tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness. Ilex tonkinensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping in cities."
