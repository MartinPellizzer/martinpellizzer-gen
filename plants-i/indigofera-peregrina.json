    "intro": "Indigofera peregrina, commonly known as the wandering indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Indigofera peregrina is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
