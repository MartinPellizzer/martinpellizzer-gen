It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. This subspecies is notable for its historical use in dye production, similar to its more widely known relative, Isatis tinctoria."
