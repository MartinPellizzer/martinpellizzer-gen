It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible fruits resembling small, round berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
