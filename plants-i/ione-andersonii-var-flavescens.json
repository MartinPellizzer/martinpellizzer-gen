    "intro": "Ione andersonii var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow mountain-mahoe, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in California. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and smooth, often grayish bark. The plant typically grows in chaparral and woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
