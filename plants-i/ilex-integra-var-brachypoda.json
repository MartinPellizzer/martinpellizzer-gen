    "intro": "Ilex integra var. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its dense, attractive form. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for small spaces and foundation plantings."
