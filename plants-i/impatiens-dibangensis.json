    "intro": "Impatiens dibangensis, commonly known as the Dibang velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of northeastern India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when disturbed, a trait that gives the genus its common name. Impatiens dibangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
