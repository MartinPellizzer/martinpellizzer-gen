It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along fences or in gardens. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea hiranensis is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its striking appearance."
