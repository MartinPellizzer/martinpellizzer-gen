    "intro": "Ilex arenicola f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical to oblanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, spherical berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
