    "intro": "Ixora carolinensis, commonly known as the scarlet coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright red or orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Its flowers are typically borne in terminal clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Ixora carolinensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and is sometimes used in erosion control."
