    "intro": "Impatiens gongolana, commonly known as the golden crown impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual appeal to gardens. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, with a deep green color that contrasts beautifully with the bright flowers. Impatiens gongolana thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
