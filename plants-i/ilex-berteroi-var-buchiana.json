    "intro": "Ilex berteroi var. buchiana, commonly known as the Buchan's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in alternate fashion along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, where it is adapted to mild, Mediterranean-type climates."
