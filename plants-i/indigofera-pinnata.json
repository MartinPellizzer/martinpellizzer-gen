    "intro": "Indigofera pinnata, commonly known as the blue pea or Indian indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is a legume, meaning it belongs to the Fabaceae family, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant also has historical significance in dye production, particularly for producing a deep blue pigment."
