    "intro": "Ischaemum nativitatis, commonly known as the native grass or silver hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with fine, silver-hairy leaves that give it its common name. Its small, greenish to pale yellow flowers are arranged in loose spikes and bloom in the summer months. Ischaemum nativitatis is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
