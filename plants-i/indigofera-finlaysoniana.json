It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers.

It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects. Its seeds are encased in pods and can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods."
