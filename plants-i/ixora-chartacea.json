    "intro": "Ixora chartacea, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, showy clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ixora chartacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in sunny conditions."
