    "intro": "Ipomoea odontophylla, commonly known as the toothed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a distinctive toothed margin, and its flowers are large, trumpet-shaped, and typically white or pale blue. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that open in the morning and close at dusk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and garden structures."
