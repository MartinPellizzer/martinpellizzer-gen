    "intro": "Iris pumila subsp. grandis, commonly known as the dwarf iris or small iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern hemisphere. It typically reaches a height of only 10\u201320 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces delicate, blue or violet-colored flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
