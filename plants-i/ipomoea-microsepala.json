    "intro": "Ipomoea microsepala, commonly known as the small-sepal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and grows as a climbing vine with tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its flowers open in the morning and close by late afternoon, a trait shared by many members of the morning glory family. Ipomoea microsepala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
