    "intro": "Isodon kameba f. komaensis, commonly known as the Koma mountain verbena, is a flowering plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in dense spike-like inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
