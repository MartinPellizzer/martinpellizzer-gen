    "intro": "Isolepis conifera, commonly known as the needle sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to the ecological health of wetland ecosystems. Isolepis conifera plays a vital role in providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
