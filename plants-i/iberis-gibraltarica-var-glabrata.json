    "intro": "Iberis gibraltarica var. glabrata, commonly known as the Gibraltar carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky shores of Gibraltar. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to its harsh coastal habitat. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
