    "intro": "Isatis latisiliqua, commonly known as the broad-leaved woad, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Historically, it was cultivated for its indigo-blue dye, similar to the more well-known Isatis tinctoria."
