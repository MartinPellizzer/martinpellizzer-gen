    "intro": "Isoetes bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Sphenopsida. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a spore\u7a57 (spore head) at the tip of its leaf-like structures. This plant is native to regions of North America, particularly in freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds. Isoetes bolanderi is an ancient lineage of plants, often found in still or slow-moving waters. Its morphology includes a rootstock with long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface."
