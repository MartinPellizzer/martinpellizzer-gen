    "intro": "Ilex corallina var. corallina, commonly known as the coral holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges in color from dark green to reddish-brown, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife, including birds and rodents. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
