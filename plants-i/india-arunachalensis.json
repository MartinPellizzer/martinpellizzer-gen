    "intro": "India arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in India. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its region."
