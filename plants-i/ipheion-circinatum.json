    "intro": "Ipheion circinatum, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal ground cover for rock gardens or woodland areas. Ipheion circinatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
