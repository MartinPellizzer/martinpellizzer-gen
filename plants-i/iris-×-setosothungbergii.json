    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 setosothungbergii, commonly known as the Japanese iris, is a hybrid perennial plant that combines traits from the Japanese iris (Iris ensata) and the Chinese iris (Iris sanguinea). It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, single or double flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland landscapes. Its foliage consists of broad, grass-like leaves that provide a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. This species is known for its hardiness and ability to naturalize, creating dense colonies that enhance the aesthetic of garden environments."
