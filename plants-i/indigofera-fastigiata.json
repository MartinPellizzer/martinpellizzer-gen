    "intro": "Indigofera fastigiata, commonly known as the tall indigo, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods and are dispersed by wind. Indigofera fastigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
