    "intro": "Isochilus pitalensis, commonly known as the Pitalense orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it prefers well-drained, acidic soils in shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
