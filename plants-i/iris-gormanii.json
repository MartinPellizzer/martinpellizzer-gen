    "intro": "Iris gormanii, commonly known as the Gorman iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in suitable habitats. Iris gormanii prefers well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands."
