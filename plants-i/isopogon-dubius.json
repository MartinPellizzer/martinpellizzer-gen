    "intro": "Isopogon dubius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mat-rush, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a low, spreading ground cover. Isopogon dubius is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
