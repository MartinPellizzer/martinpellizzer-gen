    "intro": "Iris benacensis, commonly known as the Benacense Iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, adding a distinctive visual element to its habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
