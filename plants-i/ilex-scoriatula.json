    "intro": "Ilex scoriatula, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex scoriatula thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
