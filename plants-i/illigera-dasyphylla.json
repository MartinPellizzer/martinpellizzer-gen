    "intro": "Illigera dasyphylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hairy-leaved plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
