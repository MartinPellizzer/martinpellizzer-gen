    "intro": "Ilex alainii, commonly known as Alain's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of La R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a tropical or subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex alainii is considered a rare and endangered species."
