It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
