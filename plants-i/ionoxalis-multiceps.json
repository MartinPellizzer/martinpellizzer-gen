    "intro": "Ionoxalis multiceps, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of veins, and its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, typically clustered in groups of three. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Ionoxalis multiceps is also known for its mildly acidic taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in its tissues."
