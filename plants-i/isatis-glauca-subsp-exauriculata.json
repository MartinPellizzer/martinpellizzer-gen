It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species, Isatis glauca. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Its historical use in dye production and medicinal applications highlights its botanical and cultural significance."
