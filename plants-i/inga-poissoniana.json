    "intro": "Inga poissoniana, commonly known as the pink inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded forest environments and can grow up to 15 meters in height. Inga poissoniana plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root system."
