It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive orbicular-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Its growth habit is typically as a shrub or small tree, with a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife. Inga suborbicularis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
