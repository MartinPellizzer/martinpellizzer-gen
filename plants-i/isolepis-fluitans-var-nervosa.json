    "intro": "Isolepis fluitans var. nervosa, commonly known as the water tussock grass, is a variant of the water tussock that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like growth and slender, cylindrical stems that often float on the surface of water. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy and have distinct nerve patterns, giving it its botanical name. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. This variant is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
