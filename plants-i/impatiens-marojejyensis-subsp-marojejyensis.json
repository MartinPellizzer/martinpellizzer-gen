    "intro": "Impatiens marojejyensis subsp. marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy Impatiens, is a rare and endemic species found in the Marojejy Mountains of northeastern Madagascar. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in the cool, moist understory of tropical rainforests. It is adapted to the unique microclimate of its habitat, which includes high humidity and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
