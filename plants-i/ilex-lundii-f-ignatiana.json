    "intro": "Ilex lundii f. ignatiana, commonly known as the Ignatian holly, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red berries that persist through the winter. The plant typically grows in limestone soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
