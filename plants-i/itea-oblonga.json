    "intro": "Itea oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The leaves are alternate, simple, and lanceolate, with finely toothed margins. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered panicles during late spring to early summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, woodland environments."
