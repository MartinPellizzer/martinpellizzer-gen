    "intro": "Indigofera lobata, commonly known as the blue pea or wild indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and striking blue or violet flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, enriching the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
