    "intro": "Impatiens doitungensis, commonly known as the Doitung impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically come in shades of pink and white. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are slender and often branching. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the impatiens genus."
