    "intro": "Isolepis asperiuscula, commonly known as the rough spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds and in damp soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough or hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Isolepis asperiuscula plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
