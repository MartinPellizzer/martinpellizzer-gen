    "intro": "Ilex hualgayoca, commonly known as the Hualgayoca holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
