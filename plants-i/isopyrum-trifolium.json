It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Isopyrum trifolium is often found in rich, loamy soils and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
