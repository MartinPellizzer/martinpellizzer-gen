    "intro": "Ilex toroidea, commonly known as the Toroidal Holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which is typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex toroidea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical gardens."
