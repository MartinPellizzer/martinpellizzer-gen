    "intro": "Ichnanthus calvescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow, boat-shaped bloom that appears in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. The hairy yellow iris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
