    "intro": "Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus, commonly known as the San Spiritus lophopetalum, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
