    "intro": "Inga fluvii-novi, commonly known as the river inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along riverbanks and in humid forests. Inga fluvii-novi is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential use in agroforestry systems."
