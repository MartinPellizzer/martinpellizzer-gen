    "intro": "Ilex mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex mucronata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for wildlife."
