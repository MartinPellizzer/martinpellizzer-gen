It features striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive crested center, which gives it its common name. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in woodland areas. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Iris cristata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
