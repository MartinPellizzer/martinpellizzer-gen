It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive if not managed properly."
