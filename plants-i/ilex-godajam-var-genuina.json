    "intro": "Ilex godajam var. genuina, commonly known as the Kashmiri Holly, is a rare variant of the Ilex genus native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, glossy leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
