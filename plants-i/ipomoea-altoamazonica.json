    "intro": "Ipomoea altoamazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is adapted to the rich, moist soils of the Amazon basin. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated outside its native range."
