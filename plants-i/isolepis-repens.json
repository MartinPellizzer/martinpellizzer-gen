    "intro": "Isolepis repens, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense, mat-like colonies that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas effectively. Isolepis repens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
