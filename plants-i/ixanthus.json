    "intro": "Ixanthus, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite leaves, which are often hairy and have a rough texture. Ixanthus species typically produce small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and they are often found in moist, woodland habitats. The genus includes several species, such as *Ixanthus ciliatus* and *Ixanthus hirsutus*, which are native to the Americas. Due to their similar appearance to true nettles, they are sometimes mistaken for them, but they lack the stinging hairs found on genuine nettle species."
