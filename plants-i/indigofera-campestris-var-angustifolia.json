    "intro": "Indigofera campestris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf indigo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by cylindrical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
