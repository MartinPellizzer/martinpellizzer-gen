    "intro": "Isidodendron, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have a woody stem with a smooth, often greyish bark. Isidodendron species are shrubs or small trees that can grow up to several meters in height. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
