    "intro": "Indigofera palustris, commonly known as swamp indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It features slender, often reddish stems that grow from rhizomes and bear alternate, pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
