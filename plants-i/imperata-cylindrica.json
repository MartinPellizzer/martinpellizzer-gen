It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes that form a thick mat on the ground. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that are often red or purple in color. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a whitish, powdery coating. Imperata cylindrica is known for its aggressive growth and is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
