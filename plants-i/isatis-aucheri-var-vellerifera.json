It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its historical use in dye production and ornamental value has contributed to its cultivation in botanical gardens and traditional landscapes."
