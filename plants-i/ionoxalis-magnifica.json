    "intro": "Ionoxalis magnifica, commonly known as the magnificent wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant belongs to the Oxalidaceae family, known for its calcium oxalate crystals in the leaves, which can cause irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Ionoxalis magnifica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
