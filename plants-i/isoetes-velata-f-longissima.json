    "intro": "Isoetes velata f. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed water clover, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like fronds that are often submerged, with the sporangia bearing a distinctive velvety surface. This fern is typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its morphology is adapted for underwater life, with specialized structures for gas exchange and reproduction. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
