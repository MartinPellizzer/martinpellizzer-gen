It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces inflorescences composed of dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments, typically found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
