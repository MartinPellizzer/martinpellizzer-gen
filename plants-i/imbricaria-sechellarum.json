    "intro": "Imbricaria sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical environments. It is characterized by its intricate, layered thallus structure, which consists of a complex arrangement of upper and lower cortical layers. The lichen's growth form is typically crust-like, adhering closely to its substrate, often on tree bark or rock surfaces. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the lichen community."
