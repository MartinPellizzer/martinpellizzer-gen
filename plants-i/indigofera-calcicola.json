    "intro": "Indigofera calcicola, commonly known as the limestone indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant is adapted to grow in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Indigofera calcicola is often found in rocky or limestone habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
