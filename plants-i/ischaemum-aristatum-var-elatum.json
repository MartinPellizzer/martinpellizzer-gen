    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum var. elatum, commonly known as the tall oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure is typical of the Poaceae family, with a fibrous root system and a hollow stem. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
