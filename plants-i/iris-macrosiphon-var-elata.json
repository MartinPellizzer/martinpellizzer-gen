    "intro": "Iris macrosiphon var. elata, commonly known as the tall iris, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, supporting large, showy flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant features sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, typical of many iris species. Its flowers are borne on one-sided spikes, with three upright outer petals and three inner, narrower sepals. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance and resilience in well-drained soils."
