    "intro": "Isoetes tuckermanii var. borealis, commonly known as the northern watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Sphenopsida. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant is often found in slow-moving streams, lakes, and ponds, where it forms dense underwater stands. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaves called sporophylls. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to other varieties of Isoetes."
