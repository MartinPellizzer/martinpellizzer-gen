It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and adaptability to arid environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
