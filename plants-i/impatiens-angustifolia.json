    "intro": "Impatiens angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Impatiens angustifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
