    "intro": "Isolobus sparsiflorus, commonly known as the sparsiflorous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
