    "intro": "Ischyrolepis nana, commonly known as the dwarf ischyrolepis, is a small herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and are pollinated by insects. Due to its delicate structure and limited geographic range, Ischyrolepis nana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
