    "intro": "Ipomoea fragilis var. glabra, commonly known as the silky morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often opening in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
