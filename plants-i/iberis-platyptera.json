    "intro": "Iberis platyptera, commonly known as the flat-leaf candytuft, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features pinnately divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Iberis platyptera is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
