    "intro": "Isoetes bolanderi var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a small, aquatic fern-like plant native to the western United States. It thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant's unique structure consists of a central stem with small, scale-like leaves that resemble a clover. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
