    "intro": "Ipomoea salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, willow-like leaves and clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a herbaceous vine that typically grows along the ground or climbing supports, with stems that are often hairy. It produces showy blooms during the day, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds."
