The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
