    "intro": "Ipomoea purpuricarpa, commonly known as the purple-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its striking violet to purple foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along riverbanks or in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
