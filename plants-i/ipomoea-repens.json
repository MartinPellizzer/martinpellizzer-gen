    "intro": "Ipomoea repens, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a sprawling vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals and water. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
