    "intro": "Inula calycina, commonly known as the blueweed or golden cup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its showy yellow to orange flower heads appear in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
