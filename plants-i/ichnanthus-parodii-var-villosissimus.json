    "intro": "Ichnanthus parodii var. villosissimus, commonly known as the hairy marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It features a slender, erect stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, often covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. This variety is distinguished by its dense, velvety pubescence, which gives it its common name."
