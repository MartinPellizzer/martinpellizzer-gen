    "intro": "Iris kuschakewiczii, commonly known as the Kuschakewicz iris, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring well-drained environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single, tall flowering stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
