    "intro": "Iris hartwegii var. australis, commonly known as the Australian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in Mediterranean climates."
