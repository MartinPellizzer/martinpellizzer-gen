    "intro": "Indigofera monophylla, commonly known as the Indian blue bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with woody stems and a preference for well-drained soils in warm climates."
