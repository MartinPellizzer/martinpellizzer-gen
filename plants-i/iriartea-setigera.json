    "intro": "Iriartea setigera, commonly known as the Ecuadorian cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Andes mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Iriartea setigera is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
