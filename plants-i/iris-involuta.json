    "intro": "Iris involuta, commonly known as the curled iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. Iris involuta thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is relatively low maintenance once established."
