    "intro": "Ixauchenus sublyratus, commonly known as the Mexican feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to add texture to dry garden landscapes."
