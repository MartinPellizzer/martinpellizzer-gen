    "intro": "Impatiens medogensis, commonly known as the Tibetan impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often hairy as well. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
