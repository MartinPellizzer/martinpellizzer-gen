    "intro": "Iodes klaineana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, often resembling a ghostly apparition. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is listed as endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
