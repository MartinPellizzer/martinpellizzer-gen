    "intro": "Inga fulgens, commonly known as the golden inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Inga fulgens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and secondary growth areas. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important component of ecological restoration projects."
