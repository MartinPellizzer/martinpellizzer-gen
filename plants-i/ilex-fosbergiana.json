    "intro": "Ilex fosbergiana, commonly known as Fosberg holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex fosbergiana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native range."
