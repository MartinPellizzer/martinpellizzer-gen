    "intro": "Isachne lutchuensis, commonly known as the Lutchuense grass, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of India and Bangladesh. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, lowland areas and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It plays a role in local ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the grass family."
