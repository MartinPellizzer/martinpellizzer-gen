It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have five petals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Isoglossa grandiflora is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats."
