    "intro": "Ixeris albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Ixeris albiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
