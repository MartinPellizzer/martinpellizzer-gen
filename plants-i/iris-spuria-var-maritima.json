    "intro": "Iris spuria var. maritima, commonly known as the sea iris, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize coastal sands, making it an important pioneer species in maritime ecosystems. The variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and pale-colored flowers compared to other iris species."
