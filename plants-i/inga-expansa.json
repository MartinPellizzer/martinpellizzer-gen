    "intro": "Inga expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Inga expansa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and economic benefits."
