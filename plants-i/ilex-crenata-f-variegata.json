    "intro": "Ilex crenata f. variegata, commonly known as Japanese holly or variegated Japanese holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation, which adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are attractive to birds but not typically eaten by humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a topiary or foundation plant."
