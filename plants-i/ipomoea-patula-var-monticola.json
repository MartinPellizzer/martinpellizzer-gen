    "intro": "Ipomoea patula var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
