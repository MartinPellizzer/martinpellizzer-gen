    "intro": "Ilex huana, commonly known as the Huana holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex huana thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide year-round interest."
