    "intro": "Iris rudolphii, commonly known as the Rudolph's iris, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
