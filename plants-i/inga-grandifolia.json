    "intro": "Inga grandifolia, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces pendulous clusters of yellow flowers. The tree is noted for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its fruit, which resembles a legume, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
