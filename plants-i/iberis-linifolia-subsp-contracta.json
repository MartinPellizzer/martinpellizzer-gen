    "intro": "Iberis linifolia subsp. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
