    "intro": "Indigofera semlikiensis, commonly known as the Semliki indigo, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has potential for use in agroforestry."
