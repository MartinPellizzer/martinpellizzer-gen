It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically light green and slightly hairy. The plant grows rapidly in water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in irrigation canals and rice paddies. Its stems are edible and commonly used in Asian cuisines, while the leaves are also consumed fresh or cooked. It is also known for its ability to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions, making it both a valuable food source and an invasive species in some regions."
