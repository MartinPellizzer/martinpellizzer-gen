    "intro": "Ipomoea serpens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature. Ipomoea serpens is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
