    "intro": "Icomum hockii, commonly known as the Hockii lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is commonly found on tree bark and rocks in temperate forest environments. Icomum hockii is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
