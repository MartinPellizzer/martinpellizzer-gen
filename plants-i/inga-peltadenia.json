It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its rapid growth habit makes it a common ornamental and shade plant in humid climates. Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing species."
