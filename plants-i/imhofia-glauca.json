    "intro": "Imhofia glauca, commonly known as the blue ginger, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features vibrant blue and purple bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy, bluish-green surface. Imhofia glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
