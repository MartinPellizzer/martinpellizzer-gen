    "intro": "Iris xanthochlora, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features tall, stiff stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands and riverbanks, often forming dense colonies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
