    "intro": "Ixeris japonica var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of East Asia. It features bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily. The plant has fleshy, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy or saline soils. It thrives in well-drained, coastal environments and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
