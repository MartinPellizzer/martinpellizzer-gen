    "intro": "Impatiens zombensis var. micrantha, commonly known as the zombie impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and clusters of small, bright orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its unique appearance and association with folklore, it has gained attention in both botanical and cultural contexts."
