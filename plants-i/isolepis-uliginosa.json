    "intro": "Isolepis uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, and its leaves are narrow and pointed. Isolepis uliginosa is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions."
