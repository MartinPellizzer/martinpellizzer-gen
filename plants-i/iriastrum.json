These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Iriastrum species are typically low-growing shrubs with narrow, gray-green leaves and showy yellow or white flowers. They have adapted to survive in harsh environments through deep root systems and reduced water loss. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
