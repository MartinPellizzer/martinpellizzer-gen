    "intro": "Iris acaulis, commonly known as the stemless iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and lack of a distinct stem, with all leaves arising directly from the base. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
