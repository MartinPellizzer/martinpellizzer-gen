    "intro": "Isoetes coromandelina, commonly known as the Coromandel watermoss, is a member of the genus Isoetes, which includes species of spore-bearing plants known as watermosses. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tightly packed, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense rosette. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are located at the base of the plant. Isoetes coromandelina is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
