    "intro": "Isatis tinctoria var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited woad, is a variant of the woad plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fruits and blue-green leaves that are often used in traditional dyeing processes. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves contain glucosinolates, which contribute to its medicinal and historical significance. This variant is less commonly cultivated than the standard woad but remains of interest in botanical and historical studies."
