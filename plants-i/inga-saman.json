    "intro": "Inga saman, commonly known as the \"whistling tree,\" is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves and clusters of showy white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has a shallow root system, making it effective for soil stabilization and erosion control. Its fruit pods contain edible seeds that are often used in local cuisines. The tree is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports agricultural productivity."
