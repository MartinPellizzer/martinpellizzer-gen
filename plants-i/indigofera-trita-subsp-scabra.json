    "intro": "Indigofera trita subsp. scabra, commonly known as rough indigo, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. It produces small, elongated pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
