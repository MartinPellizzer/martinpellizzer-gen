    "intro": "Isolepis minima, commonly known as the small spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 cm and features dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often reddish-brown in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and the edges of ponds. Isolepis minima plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
