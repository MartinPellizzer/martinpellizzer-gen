    "intro": "Iris goniocarpa var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typically in shades of blue or violet. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and adaptation to high-altitude environments."
