    "intro": "Ischaemum molle, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and a bluish-green color, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a tufted growth habit with dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. Ischaemum molle is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in early successional habitats."
