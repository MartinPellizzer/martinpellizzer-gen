    "intro": "Ilex triflora var. viridis, commonly known as the green-leaved holly, is a variant of the Ilex triflora species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. This variety is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
