    "intro": "Isatis undulata, commonly known as the wavy cabbage or wavy turnip, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, wavy-edged leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose, terminal inflorescences. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Isatis undulata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
