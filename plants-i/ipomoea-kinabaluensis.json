    "intro": "Ipomoea kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend trees and other structures. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are tubular with five petals. Ipomoea kinabaluensis is a rare and endemic species, found primarily in the high-altitude forests of Mount Kinabalu."
