    "intro": "Idenburgia arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak mountain fig, is a rare tropical plant native to the highlands of West New Guinea. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant's fruit is a fleshy, yellowish drupe that contains a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
