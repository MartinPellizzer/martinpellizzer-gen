    "intro": "Iozoste macroptera, commonly known as the broad-winged fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in attracting specific pollinators."
