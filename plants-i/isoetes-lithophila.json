    "intro": "Isoetes lithophila, commonly known as the rock fern moss, is a species of water fern belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a rosette of spore-bearing leaves that form a dense, compact structure. This plant typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to rocky substrates. Isoetes lithophila is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it an important indicator species for aquatic ecosystems. Its spores are released into the water, facilitating reproduction and dispersal in suitable habitats."
