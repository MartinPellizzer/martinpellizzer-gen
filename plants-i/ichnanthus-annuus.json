    "intro": "Ichnanthus annuus, commonly known as the annual bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its flowers are small and usually pink or purple in color. Ichnanthus annuus is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrient acquisition."
