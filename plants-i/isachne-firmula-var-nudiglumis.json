    "intro": "Isachne firmula var. nudiglumis, commonly known as the slender flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, compressed stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow and smooth. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. The variety nudiglumis is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) lemma, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
