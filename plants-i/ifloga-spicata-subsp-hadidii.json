    "intro": "Ifloga spicata subsp. hadidii, commonly known as the Hadid's spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The species is often found in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands."
