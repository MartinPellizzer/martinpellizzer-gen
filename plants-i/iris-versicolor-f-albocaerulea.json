    "intro": "Iris versicolor f. albocaerulea, commonly known as the blue-white iris, is a rare and striking variant of the iris genus. It is characterized by its pale blue to almost white petals, which contrast beautifully with its deep violet-blue sepals. This form is a fasciation variant, meaning it exhibits a flattened, ribbon-like growth pattern in its flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, clustered flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
