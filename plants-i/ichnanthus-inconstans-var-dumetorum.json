    "intro": "Ichnanthus inconstans var. dumetorum, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender stems with whorled leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of wetland ecosystems."
