    "intro": "Ilex macrocarpa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are alternate and often have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its evergreen-like appearance and seasonal changes make it visually striking throughout the year."
