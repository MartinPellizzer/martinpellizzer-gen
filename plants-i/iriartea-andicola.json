    "intro": "Iriartea andicola, commonly known as the Andean cycad, is a species of cycad native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of long, narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Iriartea andicola is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
