    "intro": "Ipomoea crassipes var. longepedunculata, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth rate allows it to spread quickly in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. However, this growth can lead to dense mats that disrupt water flow and reduce oxygen levels in the water."
