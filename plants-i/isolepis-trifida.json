    "intro": "Isolepis trifida, commonly known as the three-angled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in late summer. Isolepis trifida plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
