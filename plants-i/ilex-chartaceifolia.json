    "intro": "Ilex chartaceifolia, commonly known as the paperleaf holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its finely textured, papery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex chartaceifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and evergreen nature."
