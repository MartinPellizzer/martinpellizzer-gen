    "intro": "Isonandra quercifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often serrated leaves that resemble those of oak trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its botanical features include a woody stem with smooth bark and a preference for moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats. Isonandra quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
