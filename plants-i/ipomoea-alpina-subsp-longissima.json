It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet, often appearing in the morning. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
