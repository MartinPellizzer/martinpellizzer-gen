    "intro": "Isolepis pholiodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, forming dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often concealed within the foliage, making it less showy than other grasses. Isolepis pholiodes plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
