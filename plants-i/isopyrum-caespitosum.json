    "intro": "Isopyrum caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a triangular cross-section, characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces dark, glossy berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Isopyrum caespitosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
