    "intro": "Iphigeniopsis junodii, commonly known as the Junod's flaxflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
