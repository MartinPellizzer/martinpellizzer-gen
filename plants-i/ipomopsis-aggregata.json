    "intro": "Ipomopsis aggregata, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and canyon walls. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Ipomopsis aggregata plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
