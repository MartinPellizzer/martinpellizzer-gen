The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid climates and its tolerance to periodic flooding. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
