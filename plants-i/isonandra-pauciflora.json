It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
