    "intro": "Ipomoea stuckertii, commonly known as the Stuckert's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant blooms during the day, typically in the morning, and has a rapid growth rate, making it an effective cover plant. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature. Ipomoea stuckertii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
