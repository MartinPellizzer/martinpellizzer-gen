    "intro": "Iberis balansae var. vestita, commonly known as the white-flowered candytuft, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is particularly noted for its ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine settings."
