It is characterized by its large, rounded leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
