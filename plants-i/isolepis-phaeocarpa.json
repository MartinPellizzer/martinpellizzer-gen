    "intro": "Isolepis phaeocarpa, commonly known as the dark-fruited tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has triangular stems that are usually hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically brown or dark purple in color. Isolepis phaeocarpa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
