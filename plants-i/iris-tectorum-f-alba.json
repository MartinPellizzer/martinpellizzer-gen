    "intro": "Iris tectorum f. alba, commonly known as the white marsh iris, is a variant of the marsh iris species native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with ample sunlight. Its flowers bloom in early summer, producing a delicate, showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
