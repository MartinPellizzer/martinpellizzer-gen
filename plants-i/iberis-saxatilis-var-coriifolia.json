    "intro": "Iberis saxatilis var. coriifolia, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are smooth and oval, with a slightly succulent texture. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
