    "intro": "Isopyrum, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and succulent leaves that help them conserve water. Isopyrum species are generally perennial herbs with a low-growing habit. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or horticulture for their ornamental value."
