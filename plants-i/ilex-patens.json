    "intro": "Ilex patens, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex patens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
