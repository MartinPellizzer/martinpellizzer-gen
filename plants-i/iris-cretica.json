    "intro": "Iris cretica, commonly known as the creeping iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Iris cretica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and naturalized landscapes."
