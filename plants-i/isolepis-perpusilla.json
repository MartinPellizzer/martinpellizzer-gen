    "intro": "Isolepis perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually borne at the base of the plant, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis perpusilla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
