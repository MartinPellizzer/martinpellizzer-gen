    "intro": "Ionidium lineatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it survive in arid and rocky environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against drought and grazing. Ionidium lineatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
