    "intro": "Iris keredjensis, commonly known as the Keredj iris, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Its leaves are sword-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
