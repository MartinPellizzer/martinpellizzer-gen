    "intro": "Iris tectorum, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear showy, six-petaled flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in moist habitats. Iris tectorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
