    "intro": "Ilex peduncularis, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex peduncularis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a subtropical climate."
