    "intro": "Isopteryx, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Isopteryx is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
