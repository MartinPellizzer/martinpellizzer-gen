    "intro": "Ipomoea angulata var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and produces showy blooms that open in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along fences and trellises. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive if not controlled."
