    "intro": "Ilex furcata, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Ilex furcata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry, sandy habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
