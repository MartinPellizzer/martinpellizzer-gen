    "intro": "Inga quassiifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
