    "intro": "Ichnanthus candicans var. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered ichnanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green to yellow-green in color, which is a distinguishing characteristic of this variety. The flowers are borne on short pedicels and are often overlooked due to their muted hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland understories."
