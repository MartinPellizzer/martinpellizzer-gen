    "intro": "Iris brandzae f. topae, commonly known as the Topa iris, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and strikingly large, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white stripe down the center. The leaves are broad and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base of the plant. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
