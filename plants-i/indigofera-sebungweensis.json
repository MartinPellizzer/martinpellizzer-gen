It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with a woody stem and can grow up to several meters in height. It is adapted to dry, savanna-like environments and plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
