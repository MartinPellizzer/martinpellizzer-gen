    "intro": "Irlbachia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its lack of chlorophyll. Irlbachia is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species in its natural habitat. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both conservationists and botanists."
