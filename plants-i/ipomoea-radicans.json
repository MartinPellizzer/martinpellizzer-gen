    "intro": "Ipomoea radicans, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a fast-growing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and emit a mild fragrance. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often used as a ground cover but can be invasive if not controlled."
