    "intro": "Isodon hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy leaved isodon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its small, tubular flowers are typically purple or blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Isodon hirtellus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
