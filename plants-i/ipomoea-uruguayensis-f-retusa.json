    "intro": "Ipomoea uruguayensis f. retusa, commonly known as the Uruguay morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, showy flowers that typically bloom in the morning. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces edible tubers, though its primary ornamental value lies in its vibrant floral display. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. The f. retusa form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical species."
