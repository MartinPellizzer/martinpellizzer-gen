    "intro": "Inula prostrata, commonly known as creeping elecampane, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Inula prostrata is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions."
