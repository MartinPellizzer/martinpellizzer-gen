    "intro": "Ilex aculeolata, commonly known as the prickly holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex aculeolata typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
