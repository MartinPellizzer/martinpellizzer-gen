    "intro": "Isabelia violacea f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered Isabelia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The f. alba form is distinguished by its predominantly white petals, contrasting with the typical purple or violet hues of the species. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
