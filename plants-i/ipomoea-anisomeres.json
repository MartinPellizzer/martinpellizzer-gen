    "intro": "Ipomoea anisomeres, commonly known as the variable morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is a vigorous climber with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports and structures. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea anisomeres is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
