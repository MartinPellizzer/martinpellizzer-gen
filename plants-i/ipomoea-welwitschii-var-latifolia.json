    "intro": "Ipomoea welwitschii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a striking vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas. The flowers typically bloom in the early morning, hence its common name."
