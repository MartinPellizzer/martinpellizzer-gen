It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are long and narrow, with a prominent midrib and dense, fine veins that give it its common name. This bamboo thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
