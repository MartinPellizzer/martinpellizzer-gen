    "intro": "Indigofera mischocarpa, commonly known as the African indigo tree, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Additionally, it plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
