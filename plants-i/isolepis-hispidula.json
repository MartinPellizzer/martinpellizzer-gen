    "intro": "Isolepis hispidula, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, hairy stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Isolepis hispidula plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
