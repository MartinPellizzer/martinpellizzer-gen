    "intro": "Icacorea decumbens, commonly known as the creeping coralroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that relies on other plants for some of its nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes, and it has a fibrous root system that can spread along the ground. Icacorea decumbens typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and shrublands."
