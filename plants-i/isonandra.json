    "intro": "Isonandra, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian subcontinent. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped, often silvery-gray leaves that give it its common name. Isonandra species typically have small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
