    "intro": "Ipomoea villifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the morning. It is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using tendrils to support its growth. Ipomoea villifolia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
