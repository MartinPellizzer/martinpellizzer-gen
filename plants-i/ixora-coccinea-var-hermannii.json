    "intro": "Ixora coccinea var. hermannii, commonly known as the Hermann's flame bush, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the year, especially during the warmer months. The plant has opposite, narrow, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in ornamental horticulture for its ornate appearance and adaptability to various climates."
