    "intro": "Iris potaninii var. ionantha, commonly known as the Ionantha iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white throat. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan shape at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
