    "intro": "Isolepis fistulosa, commonly known as the hollow bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, hollow stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. Isolepis fistulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
