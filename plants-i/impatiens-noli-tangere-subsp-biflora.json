    "intro": "Impatiens noli-tangere subsp. biflora, commonly known as the \"touch-me-not\" or \"whispering bells,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its unique name, \"noli-tangere,\" means \"do not touch\" in Latin, referring to the explosive seed pods that burst when touched. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
