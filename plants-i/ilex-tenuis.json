    "intro": "Ilex tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex tenuis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its dense foliage and year-round greenery make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
