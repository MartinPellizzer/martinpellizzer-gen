    "intro": "Isatis platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited woad, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive blue-green color. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
