    "intro": "Ipomoea virgata var. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
