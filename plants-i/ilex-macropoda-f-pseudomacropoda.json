It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 feet, featuring glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its dense foliage and slow growth make it well-suited for use as a hedge or ornamental plant. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions."
