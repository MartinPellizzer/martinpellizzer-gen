    "intro": "Isaura alliacea, commonly known as the garlic lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, strap-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs, similar to garlic, are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Isaura alliacea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and borders."
