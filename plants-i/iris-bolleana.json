It features striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive purple beard on the lower petals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. Iris bolleana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
