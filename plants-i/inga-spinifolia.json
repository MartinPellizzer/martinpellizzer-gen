    "intro": "Inga spinifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, spiny structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and can thrive in shaded environments. Inga spinifolia is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
