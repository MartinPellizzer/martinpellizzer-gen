    "intro": "Isoetes wormaldii, commonly known as the Wormald's quillwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, spirally arranged spores rather than seeds, which are dispersed by water. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality."
