    "intro": "Isolophus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices of rocks or on dry slopes, adapting to harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Its stems are often short and prostrate, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Isolophus saxatilis is known for its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean and semi-desert climates."
