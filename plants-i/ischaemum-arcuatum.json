    "intro": "Ischaemum arcuatum, commonly known as the bentgrass or curly bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Ischaemum arcuatum is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator plant for certain ecological conditions."
