    "intro": "Inga medellinensis, commonly known as the Medellin inga, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it ecologically significant in tropical ecosystems."
