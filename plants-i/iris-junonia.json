    "intro": "Iris junonia, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, flat, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers with a distinct three-parted structure. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize wetland habitats effectively. Iris junonia is often used in ornamental gardening but can become invasive in natural ecosystems."
