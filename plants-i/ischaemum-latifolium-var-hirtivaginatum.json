    "intro": "Ischaemum latifolium var. hirtivaginatum, commonly known as the hairy-stalked broadleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a rough texture, and the inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
