It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that open in the morning. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy and can root at the nodes. This species is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an attractive but sometimes invasive plant in certain regions."
