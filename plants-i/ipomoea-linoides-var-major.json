    "intro": "Ipomoea linoides var. major, commonly known as the large-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
