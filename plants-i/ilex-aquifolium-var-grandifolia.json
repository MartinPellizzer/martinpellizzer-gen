    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are broader and more elongated than those of the typical Ilex aquifolium. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and some animals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide year-round interest in garden settings."
