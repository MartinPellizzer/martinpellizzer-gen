    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. dipirena, commonly known as the Spanish holly, is a variant of the common holly native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with serrated edges and red berries. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its dense foliage makes it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or planting this species."
