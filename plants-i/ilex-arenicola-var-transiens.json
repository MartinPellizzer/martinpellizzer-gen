    "intro": "Ilex arenicola var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Heath Oak, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern California. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It bears red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts."
