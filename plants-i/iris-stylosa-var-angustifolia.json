    "intro": "Iris stylosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, typically ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. Its botanical structure is adapted to its wetland habitat, with a rhizomatous root system that aids in anchoring and nutrient absorption."
