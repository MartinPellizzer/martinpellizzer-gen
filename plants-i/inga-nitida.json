    "intro": "Inga nitida, commonly known as the white inga, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its alternate, pinnate leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Inga nitida is often found in secondary forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its rapid growth makes it useful for reforestation and as a shade tree in agroforestry systems."
