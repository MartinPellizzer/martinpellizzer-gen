    "intro": "Imperata sape, commonly known as the red grass or red bamboo grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and tall, grass-like foliage that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in panicles, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Its leaves are narrow,\u575a\u97e7 (tough), and often have a reddish hue, especially when dried. Imperata sape is widely used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber for basket weaving and thatching."
