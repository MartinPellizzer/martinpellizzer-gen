    "intro": "Ilex theezans var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved holly, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the holly genus. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
