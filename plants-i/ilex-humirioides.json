    "intro": "Ilex humirioides, commonly known as the swamp holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast, where it thrives in wetland environments. The plant is evergreen, with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
