    "intro": "Isachne rigida, commonly known as rigid isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are usually hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and often tightly packed. Isachne rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits."
