    "intro": "Iris ventricosa, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, upright stems that bear showy, violet-blue to white flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant has broad, grass-like leaves that are often hairy and grow in dense clusters at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Iris ventricosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
