    "intro": "Ipomoea trichocephala, commonly known as the curly top morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can become invasive if not managed properly. The species is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
