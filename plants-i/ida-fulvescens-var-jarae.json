    "intro": "Ida fulvescens var. jarae, commonly known as the Jarae goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss. Ida fulvescens var. jarae is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
