    "intro": "Iberis nana, commonly known as dwarf candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with bright white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Iberis nana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
