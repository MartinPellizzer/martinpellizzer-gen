    "intro": "Isotrema manshuriensis, commonly known as the Manshurian isotrema, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to specific regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in temperate forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark berries that are often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isotrema manshuriensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
