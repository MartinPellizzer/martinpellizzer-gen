    "intro": "Iris lutescens subsp. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiensis iris, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in early spring and are adorned with a distinctive violet-blue stripe along the sepal. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
