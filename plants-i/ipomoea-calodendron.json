    "intro": "Ipomoea calodendron, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinct pattern of darker markings. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
