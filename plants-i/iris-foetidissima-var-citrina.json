    "intro": "Iris foetidissima var. citrina, commonly known as the yellow marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, often fragrant, dark-colored center. The leaves are grass-like, narrow, and dark green, typically growing in dense clumps. This variety is characterized by its striking color contrast between the bright yellow petals and the deep brownish-purple markings. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
