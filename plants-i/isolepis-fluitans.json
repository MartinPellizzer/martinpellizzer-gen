    "intro": "Isolepis fluitans, commonly known as floating flat sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brown spikelets. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true flowers, instead relying on wind pollination. Isolepis fluitans plays an important role in filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic insects and small vertebrates."
