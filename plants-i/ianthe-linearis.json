It features slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ianthe linearis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
