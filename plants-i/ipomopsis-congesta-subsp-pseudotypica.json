    "intro": "Ipomopsis congesta subsp. pseudotypica, commonly known as the Sierra lily or Sierra bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The subspecies pseudotypica is distinguished by its more compact growth form and slightly different floral characteristics compared to other subspecies of Ipomopsis congesta."
