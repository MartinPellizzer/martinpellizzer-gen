    "intro": "Ilex uraiensis, commonly known as the Urai holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but generally toxic to humans. Ilex uraiensis is often found in shaded, moist environments within tropical and subtropical forests."
