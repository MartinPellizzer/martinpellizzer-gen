    "intro": "Isolepis tenuifolia, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats in marshes and pond edges. Isolepis tenuifolia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
