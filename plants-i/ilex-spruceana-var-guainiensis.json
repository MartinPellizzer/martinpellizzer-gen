    "intro": "Ilex spruceana var. guainiensis, commonly known as the Guainiense holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of primary forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
