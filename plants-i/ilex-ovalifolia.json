    "intro": "Ilex ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex ovalifolia is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and year-round aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
