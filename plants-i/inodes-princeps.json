    "intro": "Inodes princeps, commonly known as the royal indole, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a crown. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and waxy, with a subtle iridescence that becomes more pronounced in sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Inodes princeps is considered a vulnerable species."
