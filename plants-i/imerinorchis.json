    "intro": "Imerinorchis, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often display a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower spike with several blooms. Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, Imerinorchis is considered a vulnerable species."
