It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and produces edible tubers that are sometimes consumed in traditional cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The smooth glabrous surface of its stems and leaves distinguishes this variant from other related species."
