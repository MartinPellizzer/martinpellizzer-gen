    "intro": "Iberis spathulata subsp. lereschiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf candytuft, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and frost tolerance."
