It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard Ilex theezans. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
