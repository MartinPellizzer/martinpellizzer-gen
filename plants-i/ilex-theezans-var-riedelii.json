    "intro": "Ilex theezans var. riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's holly, is a variant of the evergreen holly species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is often used as a hedge or in container gardens."
