It is characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage that turns a striking purplish-red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its unique leaf coloration and adaptability contribute to its ecological and horticultural significance."
