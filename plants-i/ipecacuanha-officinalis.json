    "intro": "Ipecacuanha officinalis, commonly known as the vomiting plant, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant contains various alkaloids, with emetine and cephaline being the most notable for their medicinal properties. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine to treat ailments, though its use is now largely restricted due to its toxic effects. Its name derives from the Portuguese word \"ip\u00ea,\" meaning \"to vomit,\" reflecting its emetic properties."
