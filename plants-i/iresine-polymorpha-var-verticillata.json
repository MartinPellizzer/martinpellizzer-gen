    "intro": "Iresine polymorpha var. verticillata, commonly known as the red-leaf iron plant, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep red to purple, often with contrasting white or silver veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or red, which appear in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and is suitable for indoor or outdoor cultivation in suitable climates."
