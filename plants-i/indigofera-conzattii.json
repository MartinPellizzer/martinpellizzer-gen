It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, violet to blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods and are used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
