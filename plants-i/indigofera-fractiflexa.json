    "intro": "Indigofera fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible indigo plant, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
