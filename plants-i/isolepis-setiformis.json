It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, three-parted flowers. Isolepis setiformis typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies that help stabilize shorelines. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
