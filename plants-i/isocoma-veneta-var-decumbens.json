    "intro": "Isocoma veneta var. decumbens, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features slender, decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
