    "intro": "Ipomoea paludosa, commonly known as swamp morningglory, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable wetland indicator species and a potential invasive plant."
