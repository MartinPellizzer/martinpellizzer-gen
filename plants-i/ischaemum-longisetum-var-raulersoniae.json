    "intro": "Ischaemum longisetum var. raulersoniae, commonly known as the Raulerson's bearded grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear short, stiff hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often bracted and appears at the base of the plant. This variant is notable for its distinctive morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and unique genetic traits."
