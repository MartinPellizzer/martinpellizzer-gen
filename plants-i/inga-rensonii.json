    "intro": "Inga rensonii, commonly known as the pink inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is distinguished by its striking pink to purple flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate leaflets that provide a feathery appearance. Inga rensonii is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
