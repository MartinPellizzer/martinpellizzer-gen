    "intro": "Isanthina, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. Isanthina species are characterized by their compact growth habit, with small, often white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. They typically grow in sandy or gravelly soils and are adapted to harsh, dry environments. The genus is noted for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
