It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are usually arranged in a V-shaped pattern, and the plant is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites."
