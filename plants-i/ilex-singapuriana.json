    "intro": "Ilex singapuriana, commonly known as the Singapore holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to Singapore and parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, featuring dense, glossy dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife. Ilex singapuriana is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability to urban environments."
