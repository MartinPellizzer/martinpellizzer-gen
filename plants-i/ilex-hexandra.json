It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex hexandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
