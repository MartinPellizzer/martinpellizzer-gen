    "intro": "Iris pardalino, commonly known as the purple iris, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. Iris pardalino is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
