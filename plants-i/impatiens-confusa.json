It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Impatiens confusa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
