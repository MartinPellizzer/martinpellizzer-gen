    "intro": "Ionidium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf ionidium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
