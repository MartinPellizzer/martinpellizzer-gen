It is characterized by its striking, salmon-pink to orange-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with sword-shaped, dark green leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
