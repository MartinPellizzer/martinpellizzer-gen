    "intro": "Ischaemum anthephoroides var. subnudum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, often reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less hairy than those of the typical variety. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs and slender growth habit compared to other forms of Ischaemum anthephoroides."
