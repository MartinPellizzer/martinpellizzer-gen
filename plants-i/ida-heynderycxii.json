    "intro": "Ida heynderycxii, commonly known as the Heynderyck's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ida heynderycxii is considered a vulnerable species."
