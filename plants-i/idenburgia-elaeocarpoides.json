    "intro": "Idenburgia elaeocarpoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped pods containing edible seeds. Its botanical features make it suitable for ornamental purposes and in some cases, for minor timber use. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
