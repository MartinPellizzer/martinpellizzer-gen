    "intro": "Ilex chevalieri, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Ilex chevalieri thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense growth habit and year-round foliage make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
