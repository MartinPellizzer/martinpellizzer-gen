    "intro": "Iberis sempervirens subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, bright green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens as a ground cover or edging plant."
