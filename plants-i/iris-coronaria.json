It features upright, sword-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert foothills and canyons. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, making it an important species in its native ecosystem."
