It is characterized by its spore-bearing, spike-like structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in a dense, compact cluster. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in muddy or shallow waters. Its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, with a distinct midrib. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable plant in aquatic ecosystems."
