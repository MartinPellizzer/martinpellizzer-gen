    "intro": "Imbricaria coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, leathery texture due to its coriaceous thallus. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and tropical regions, forming dense, irregular patches. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in diverse environmental conditions. Its surface is often covered with a layer of wax, providing protection against desiccation and UV radiation. Imbricaria coriacea plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as a habitat for microorganisms."
