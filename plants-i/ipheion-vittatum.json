    "intro": "Ipheion vittatum, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, adding visual interest in both seasons. The species is also valued for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense, attractive groundcovers."
