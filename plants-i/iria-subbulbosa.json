It features a rhizomatous root system with bulb-like structures that store nutrients and water. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Iridaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing from the base of the plant. Iria subbulbosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
