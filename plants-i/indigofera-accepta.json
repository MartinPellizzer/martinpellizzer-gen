    "intro": "Indigofera accepta, commonly known as Indian indigo or small indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring pinnately compound leaves and showy purple or blue flowers. The plant is notable for its historical use in producing natural dyes, particularly the indigo pigment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open habitats such as forests and grasslands. Its botanical significance extends to its role in traditional medicine and as a source of nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
