    "intro": "Ilex longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves with long, stiff hairs on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Ilex longipilosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
