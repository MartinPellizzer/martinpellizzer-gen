It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant produces distinctive, spiny sepals that give it its common name and help protect the developing flower. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
