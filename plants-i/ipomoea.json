    "intro": "Ipomoea, commonly known as morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are characterized by their trumpet-shaped flowers, which typically open in the morning and close at night. Ipomoea species are native to various regions, including the Americas, Africa, and Asia, and many are cultivated for their ornamental value. They are also known for their rapid growth and climbing habit, often using tendrils to ascend supports. Some species, like Ipomoea batatas, are economically important for their edible roots, which are used to produce sweet potatoes."
