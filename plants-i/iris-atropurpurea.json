    "intro": "Iris atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple root iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a dark purple center. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water in arid environments. Iris atropurpurea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking blooms."
