    "intro": "Inga foliosa, commonly known as the \"brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Inga foliosa plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the rainforest by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
