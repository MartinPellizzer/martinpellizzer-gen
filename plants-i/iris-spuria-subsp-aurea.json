    "intro": "Iris spuria subsp. aurea, commonly known as the golden iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically grass-like in appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to white flowers with three upright petals and three spreading sepals. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The golden iris is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
