    "intro": "Isoglossa longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered isoglossa, is a herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Isoglossa longiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments like forest understories or along stream banks."
