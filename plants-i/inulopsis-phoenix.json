It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in yellow or white, often in late spring or early summer. Inulopsis phoenix is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
