    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. multicrenata, commonly known as Japanese holly or dwarf holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive wavy or scalloped edge, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is highly valued in horticulture for its dense, upright growth habit and year-round foliage. Ilex crenata var. multicrenata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and foundation plantings."
