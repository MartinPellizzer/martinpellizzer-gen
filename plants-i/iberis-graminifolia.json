    "intro": "Iberis graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
