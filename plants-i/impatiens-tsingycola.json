    "intro": "Impatiens tsingycola, commonly known as the Tsingy Mountains impatiens, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically come in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in the unique limestone habitats of the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
