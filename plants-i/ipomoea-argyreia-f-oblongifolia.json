    "intro": "Ipomoea argyreia f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf morning glory, is a variant of the species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are predominantly silver or white in color, with a green midrib. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its flowers."
