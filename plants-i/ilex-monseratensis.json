It is native to the island of Menorca in the Balearic Sea, where it grows in coastal and forested areas. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are glossy and elliptical in shape. It produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex monseratensis is considered a rare and endangered plant."
