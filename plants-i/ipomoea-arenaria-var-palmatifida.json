    "intro": "Ipomoea arenaria var. palmatifida, commonly known as the palmate morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant features palmately lobed leaves, which give it its botanical name, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed soils, where it spreads via rhizomes. The flowers typically bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated by bees and other insects."
