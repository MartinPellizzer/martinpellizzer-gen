It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Impatiens eriocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
