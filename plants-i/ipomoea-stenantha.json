    "intro": "Ipomoea stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, pale to bright blue or purple flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening. The plant has heart-shaped, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Ipomoea stenantha is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to support its growth."
