    "intro": "Ida fulvescens, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ida fulvescens is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
