    "intro": "Iris gatesii, commonly known as the Gates' iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Iris gatesii prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
