    "intro": "Ilex dumosa var. montevideensis, commonly known as the Montevideo holly, is a shrub or small tree native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
