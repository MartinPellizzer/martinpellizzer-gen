It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on the calyx, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a yellow throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Impatiens ecalcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
