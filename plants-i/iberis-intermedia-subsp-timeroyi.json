    "intro": "Iberis intermedia subsp. timeroyi, commonly known as the Turkish Iberis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, bright green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
