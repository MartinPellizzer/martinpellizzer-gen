    "intro": "Iris squalens, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Iris squalens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
