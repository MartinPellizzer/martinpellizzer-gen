It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the understory of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
