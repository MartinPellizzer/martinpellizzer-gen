It is characterized by its striking, deep red to purple flowers with four petals instead of the typical three, a trait that makes it distinct within the Iris genus. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, adding to its visual appeal. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental qualities."
