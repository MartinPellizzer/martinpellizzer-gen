    "intro": "Isotropis iophyta, commonly known as the golden sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. Isotropis iophyta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
