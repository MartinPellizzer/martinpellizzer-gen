    "intro": "Ixeris \u00d7 sekimotoi, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Ixeris sinensis and Ixeris dentata, characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats."
