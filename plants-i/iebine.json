    "intro": "Iebine, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant has a unique reproductive system, relying on specific pollinators that are adapted to its harsh environment. Its leaves are small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in the arid conditions it inhabits. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, the iebine is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
