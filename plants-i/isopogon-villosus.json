It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from red to orange, which appear in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy environments. Isopogon villosus is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing nectar for native pollinators."
