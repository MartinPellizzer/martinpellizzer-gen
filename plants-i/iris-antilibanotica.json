    "intro": "Iris antilibanotica, commonly known as the Libanotis iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
