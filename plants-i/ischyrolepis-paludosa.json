    "intro": "Ischyrolepis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh pellitory, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and other waterlogged habitats. The plant features small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Ischyrolepis paludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
