    "intro": "Ilex dubia var. pseudomacropoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its evergreen nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat preservation."
