It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, rhizomatous stems that spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Ixeris repens is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
