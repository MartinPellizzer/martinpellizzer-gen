    "intro": "Ischaemum rugosum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf hairy oat, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems that are often less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a rough, textured surface. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable native plant for ecological restoration projects."
