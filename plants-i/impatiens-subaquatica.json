    "intro": "Impatiens subaquatica, commonly known as water impatiens, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It thrives in wetland environments, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with roots that anchor it in the substrate. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive spurred shape, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Impatiens subaquatica is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to improve water quality in aquatic habitats."
