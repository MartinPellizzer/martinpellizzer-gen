    "intro": "Iris fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking blue to violet flowers with a distinct white or yellow central stripe. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its rhizomes are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Iris fibrosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its historical use in herbal remedies."
