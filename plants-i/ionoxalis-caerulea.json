    "intro": "Ionoxalis caerulea, commonly known as blue woodland sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it has a shallow root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Ionoxalis caerulea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
