    "intro": "Itea parviflora var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf smooth hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are broad and ovate, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which gradually change to a reddish hue as they age. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and adaptable plant for both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
