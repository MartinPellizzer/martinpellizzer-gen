The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, three-ranked flowers. Imperata filifolia is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
