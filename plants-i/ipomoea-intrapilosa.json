    "intro": "Ipomoea intrapilosa, commonly known as the pilose morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, fibrous stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white, which bloom in the morning. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Ipomoea intrapilosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
