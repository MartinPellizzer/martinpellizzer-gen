    "intro": "Ipomoea perryana, commonly known as the Perry's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, showy flowers that typically bloom in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces tendrils that help it climb and spread along structures. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
