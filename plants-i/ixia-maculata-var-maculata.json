It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with distinctive spots. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens in cooler climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. The species is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
