    "intro": "Ixerba brexioides, commonly known as the eastern swamp willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, willow-like branches with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are male and female flowers arranged in separate clusters. Ixerba brexioides plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
