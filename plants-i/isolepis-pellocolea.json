    "intro": "Isolepis pellocolea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that grow in dense tufts, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland wetlands. Isolepis pellocolea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
