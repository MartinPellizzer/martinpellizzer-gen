It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pods containing seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for its nitrogen-fixing properties."
