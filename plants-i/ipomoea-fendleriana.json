    "intro": "Ipomoea fendleriana, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial vine that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert regions. The plant produces striking trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
