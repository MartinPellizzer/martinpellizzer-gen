    "intro": "Inga bigemina, commonly known as the \"bitter bean\" or \"wild coffee,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, though the fruit is often bitter. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Inga bigemina is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
