    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the blue oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
