    "intro": "Iaera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Iaera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along cliffs and shorelines. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens that mimic coastal landscapes."
