    "intro": "Iris cengialti f. vochinensis, commonly known as the Vochin iris, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems that support its showy inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
