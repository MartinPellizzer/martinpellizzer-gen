    "intro": "Indigofera setiflora, commonly known as the slender indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces raceme-like inflorescences with bright yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Indigofera setiflora is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
