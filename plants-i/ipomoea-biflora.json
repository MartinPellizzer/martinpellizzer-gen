    "intro": "Ipomoea biflora, commonly known as the twin-flower morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale blue. The plant is a vine that can climb using its tendrils, often reaching lengths of several meters. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea biflora is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
