    "intro": "Ipomoea phymatodes, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, wet environments such as swamps and marshes. Its stems are often covered in a distinctive, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Ipomoea phymatodes is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
