    "intro": "Ichnanthus nemorosus, commonly known as the forest violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the woodlands of North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Ichnanthus nemorosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
