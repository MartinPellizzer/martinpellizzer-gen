    "intro": "Itea virginica, commonly known as smooth hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces panicles of small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Itea virginica is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade."
