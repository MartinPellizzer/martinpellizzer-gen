    "intro": "Isopogon scabriusculus, commonly known as the roughleaf banksia, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, cone-like inflorescences that develop from the base of the plant. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a rough, scaly texture, giving the plant its common name. It produces bright yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is often found in heathlands and is adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat."
