    "intro": "Ipomoea sphenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive narrow leaf blade. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated as a garden plant but can become invasive in certain environments."
