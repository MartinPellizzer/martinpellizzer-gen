It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that often bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
