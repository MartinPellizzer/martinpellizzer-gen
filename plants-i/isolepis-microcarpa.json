    "intro": "Isolepis microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. Isolepis microcarpa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality."
