    "intro": "Impatiens cyathiflora, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of about 15 to 30 centimeters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Impatiens cyathiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
