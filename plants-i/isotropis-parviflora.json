    "intro": "Isotropis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered isotropis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
