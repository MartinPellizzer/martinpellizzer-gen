    "intro": "Ilex fortunei f. aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden variegated holly, is a cultivar of the Chinese holly. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that feature a mix of yellow, white, and green hues. The plant is evergreen, with a dense, compact growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental purposes. It produces small, red berries in the winter, adding seasonal interest to the landscape. The variegation is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll distribution in the leaves."
