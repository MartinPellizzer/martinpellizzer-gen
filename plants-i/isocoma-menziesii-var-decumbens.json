    "intro": "Isocoma menziesii var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit with many stems lying close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
