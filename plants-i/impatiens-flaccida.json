    "intro": "Impatiens flaccida, commonly known as the drooping touch-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, with five petals and a spur. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its name reflects its tendency to droop under the weight of its flowers, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or containers."
