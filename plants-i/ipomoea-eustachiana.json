    "intro": "Ipomoea eustachiana, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange, blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Ipomoea eustachiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
