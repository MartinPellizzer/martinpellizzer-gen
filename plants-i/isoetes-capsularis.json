    "intro": "Isoetes capsularis, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are often encased in a bladder-like sac. This plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it anchors itself to the substrate. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for nutrient absorption. Isoetes capsularis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
