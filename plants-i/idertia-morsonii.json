    "intro": "Idertia morsonii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its succulent leaves help store water, making it well-suited for desert conditions."
