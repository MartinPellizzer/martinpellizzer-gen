It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, ditches, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed, forming a dense clump. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often found in coastal or inland wetlands."
