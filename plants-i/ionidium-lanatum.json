    "intro": "Ionidium lanatum, commonly known as the woolly ionidium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, lanate (woolly) covering on its stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a slight fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
