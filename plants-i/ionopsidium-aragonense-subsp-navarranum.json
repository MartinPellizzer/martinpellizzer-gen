    "intro": "Ionopsidium aragonense subsp. navarranum, commonly known as the Navarre bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in mountainous regions, showcasing its adaptation to arid and nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
