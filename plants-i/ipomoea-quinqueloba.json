    "intro": "Ipomoea quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a vine that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with five distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ipomoea quinqueloba is often found in wetlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas where it can spread rapidly."
