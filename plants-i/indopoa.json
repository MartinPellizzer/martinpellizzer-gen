    "intro": "Indopoa, commonly known as the grass genus native to the Himalayas and Central Asia, consists of several species characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. These plants typically thrive in alpine and subalpine environments, where they form dense mats or low-growing clumps. Indopoa species are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in their native habitats. Due to their ecological significance, some species of Indopoa are also studied for their potential in restoration ecology."
