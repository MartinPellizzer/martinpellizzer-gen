    "intro": "Inocarpus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan bottle tree, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped trunk that tapers dramatically toward the top, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its ability to store water in its thick, woody stem, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, typically producing bright yellow or orange blooms that attract pollinators like bees and birds."
