    "intro": "Inga marginata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind or Brazilian tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree is often found in moist tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions make it a useful species for reforestation and agroforestry."
