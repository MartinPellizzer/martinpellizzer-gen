    "intro": "Indigofera petraea, commonly known as the rock indigo, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. It is often found in dry, limestone-rich habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
