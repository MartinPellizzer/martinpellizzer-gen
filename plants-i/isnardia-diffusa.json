    "intro": "Isnardia diffusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Isnardia diffusa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
