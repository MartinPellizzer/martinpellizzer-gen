    "intro": "Ilex polyphylla, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and some animals. Ilex polyphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dense foliage and seasonal color changes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
