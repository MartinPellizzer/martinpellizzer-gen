It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and secondary growth areas. Inga glomeriflora is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
