It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value."
