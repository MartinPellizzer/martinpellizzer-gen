    "intro": "Iris relicta, commonly known as the relic iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iris relicta is considered a rare and endangered species."
