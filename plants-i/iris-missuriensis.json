    "intro": "Iris missuriensis, commonly known as the Missouri iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces showy, lavender-blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-parted lip. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. The Missouri iris is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
