    "intro": "Iris rossii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, typically ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three downward-facing sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
