    "intro": "Iris fugax, commonly known as the transient iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to its short blooming period, it is often referred to as a fleeting beauty in the botanical world."
