    "intro": "Ischaemum muticum, commonly known as the common bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stem. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in damp woodlands. Ischaemum muticum is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
