    "intro": "Ischaemum lanceolatum, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil. Ischaemum lanceolatum is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it a common indicator of ecological succession."
