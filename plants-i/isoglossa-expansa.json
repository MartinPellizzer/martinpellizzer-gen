    "intro": "Isoglossa expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf isoglossa, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth margin and a prominent midrib, often growing up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in late spring, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing capsules. Its foliage is characterized by a distinctive silvery-white underside, which aids in identifying the species. Isoglossa expansa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
