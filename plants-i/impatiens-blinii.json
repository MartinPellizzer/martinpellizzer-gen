    "intro": "Impatiens blinii, commonly known as the golden crown impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters atop slender stems. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can extend from late spring through early autumn."
