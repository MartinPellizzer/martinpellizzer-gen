    "intro": "Ipomoea grantii var. palmatopinnata, commonly known as the broad-leaf morning glory, is a tropical climbing vine characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. The plant is native to Central America and thrives in warm, humid climates with abundant sunlight. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in ornamental gardens. The foliage and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
