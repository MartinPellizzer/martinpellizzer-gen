    "intro": "Ipomoea polymorpha subf. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in certain environments."
