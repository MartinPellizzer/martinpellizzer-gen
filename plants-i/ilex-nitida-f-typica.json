    "intro": "Ilex nitida f. typica, commonly known as the silver evergreen holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its slow growth rate and attractive form make it suitable for hedges or as a specimen plant in landscaped areas."
