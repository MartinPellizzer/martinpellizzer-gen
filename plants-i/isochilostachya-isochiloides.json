    "intro": "Isochilostachya isochiloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-covered flower clusters. Isochilostachya isochiloides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
