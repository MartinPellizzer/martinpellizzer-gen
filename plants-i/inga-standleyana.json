    "intro": "Inga standleyana, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Its rapid growth rate makes it a valuable species for agroforestry and soil stabilization. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it suitable for understory plantings in tropical forests."
