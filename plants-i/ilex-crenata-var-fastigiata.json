    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright Japanese holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage that is narrow and upright, giving it a formal, geometric appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for use as a foundation plant or in container gardens due to its slow growth and hardy nature. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular choice for year-round landscaping."
