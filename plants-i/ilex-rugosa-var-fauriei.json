    "intro": "Ilex rugosa var. fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its dense foliage and year-round structure make it suitable for hedges and topiary."
