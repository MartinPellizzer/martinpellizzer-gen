    "intro": "Isidorea oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf isidorea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Isidorea oblanceolata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
