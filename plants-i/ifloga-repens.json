    "intro": "Ifloga repens, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a spreading rhizomatous stem that allows it to colonize moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color and small, delicate white or yellow flowers. Its botanical characteristics include trifoliate leaves and a fibrous root system, which contribute to its ability to thrive in damp environments. Ifloga repens is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and early spring blooms."
