    "intro": "Iostephane papposa, commonly known as the desert papposa, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and silvery foliage. The plant has small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Iostephane papposa is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils."
