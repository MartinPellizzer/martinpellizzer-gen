    "intro": "Isolepis cernua var. andina, commonly known as Andean flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
