    "intro": "Ipomoea longirostra, commonly known as the long-beaked morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and has a climbing habit, often using tendrils to support itself. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are small and covered in a sticky coating. Ipomoea longirostra is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
