    "intro": "Inga exfoliata, commonly known as the tropical false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 11 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by flat, bean-like pods. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions make it a common ornamental and reforestation species. The plant also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
