    "intro": "Ionopsis utricularioides var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its flowers are small and often clustered in spikes. It is a perennial herb that relies on aquatic environments for its survival. The species is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor habitats through its carnivorous behavior."
