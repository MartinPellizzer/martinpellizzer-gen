    "intro": "Iris humilis f. phyllospatha, commonly known as the leaf-spathate iris, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the iris genus. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring broad, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with a prominent central yellow beard, typical of many iris species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural distribution, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts and botanists."
