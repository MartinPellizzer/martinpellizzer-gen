    "intro": "Ilex fuertensiana var. selleana, commonly known as the Selleana holly, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are oval in shape with spiny margins. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are ornamental and attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
