    "intro": "Iseia luxurians, commonly known as the golden leaf fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lush, velvety fronds that display a vibrant golden-green hue, especially when exposed to bright, indirect light. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to tree trunks or rocky surfaces in its natural habitat. It thrives in high humidity and warm temperatures, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a sought-after ornamental plant."
