    "intro": "Ilex bioritsensis var. integra, commonly known as the smoothleaf holly, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and not serrated, distinguishing it from other holly varieties. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for various bird species. It is typically evergreen, with a dense, shrub-like growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental planting. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
