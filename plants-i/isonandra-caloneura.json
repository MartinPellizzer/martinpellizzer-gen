    "intro": "Isonandra caloneura, commonly known as the slender-leafed rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often leathery and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrub habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
