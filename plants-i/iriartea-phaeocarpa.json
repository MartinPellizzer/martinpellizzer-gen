    "intro": "Iriartea phaeocarpa, commonly known as the dark-leaved arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine. Iriartea phaeocarpa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
