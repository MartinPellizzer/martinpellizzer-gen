    "intro": "Ichnanthus pilosomarginatus, commonly known as the hairy-margin sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures along the margins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for arid and semi-arid landscapes."
