    "intro": "Impatiens inconspicua var. jogensis, commonly known as the Jog's Impatiens, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically during the wet season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is often found in forest understories, where it benefits from the dappled light and moist soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
