    "intro": "Ionidium atropurpureum var. grandifolium, commonly known as the purple-leafed ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple, velvety leaves that provide striking visual contrast against its rugged, woody stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tropical or subtropical climates. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens."
