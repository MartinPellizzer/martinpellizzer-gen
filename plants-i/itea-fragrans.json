    "intro": "Itea fragrans, commonly known as sweet fern, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like foliage that emits a sweet scent when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late spring and are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Itea fragrans is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
