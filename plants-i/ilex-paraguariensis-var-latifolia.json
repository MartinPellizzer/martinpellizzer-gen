    "intro": "Ilex paraguariensis var. latifolia, commonly known as Brazilian coffee tree or cupua\u00e7u, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and small, dark berries that contain the seeds used for caffeine extraction. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is closely related to the coffee plant but is primarily cultivated for its seeds rather than its leaves. This variety is valued for its ecological role and potential in sustainable agriculture."
