    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 fulvala var. choctawensis, commonly known as the Choctaw iris, is a hybrid iris species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers with a deep purple center, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
