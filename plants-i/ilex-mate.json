It is native to the subtropical regions of Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, red or yellowish berries that contain seeds. The leaves are harvested for their stimulating properties, as they contain caffeine and other alkaloids. Ilex mate is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
