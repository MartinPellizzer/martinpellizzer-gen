It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as trellises or fences. It produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ipomoea erosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
