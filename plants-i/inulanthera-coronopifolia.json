    "intro": "Inulanthera coronopifolia, commonly known as the crownvetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with several oval-shaped leaflets and is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping and restoration projects. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
