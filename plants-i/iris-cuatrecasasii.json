    "intro": "Iris cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' iris, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely arranged along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
