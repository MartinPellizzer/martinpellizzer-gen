It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, vibrant purple petals and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on mycorrhizal associations. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and hummingbirds, showcasing a unique ecological relationship. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
