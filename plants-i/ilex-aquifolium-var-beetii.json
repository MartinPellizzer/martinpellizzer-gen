    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. beetii, commonly known as the Atlantic holly, is a variant of the common holly native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have spiny margins. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and shrublands near the coast. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
