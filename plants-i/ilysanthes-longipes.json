    "intro": "Ilysanthes longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ilysanthes longipes is considered a vulnerable species."
