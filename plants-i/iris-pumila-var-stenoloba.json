It features compact, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, often with a distinct central white stripe. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
