It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers throughout the year. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
