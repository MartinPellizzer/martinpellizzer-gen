    "intro": "Ilex rarasanensis, commonly known as the rare san mountain holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, specifically found in parts of Vietnam and Laos. This evergreen shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ilex rarasanensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
