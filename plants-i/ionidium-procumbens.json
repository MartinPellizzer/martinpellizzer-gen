It typically features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ionidium procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks."
