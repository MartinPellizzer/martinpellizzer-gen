    "intro": "Indigofera oligosperma, commonly known as the small-seeded indigo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pods containing small, black seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a dye. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
