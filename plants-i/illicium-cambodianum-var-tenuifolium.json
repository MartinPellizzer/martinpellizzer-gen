It belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces star-shaped fruits that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to star anise. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
