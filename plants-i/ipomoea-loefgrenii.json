    "intro": "Ipomoea loefgrenii, commonly known as the Hawaiian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that open in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, colorful blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows as a vine, climbing or trailing along the ground, and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
