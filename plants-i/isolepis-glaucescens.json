    "intro": "Isolepis glaucescens, commonly known as blue marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tufted, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Isolepis glaucescens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
