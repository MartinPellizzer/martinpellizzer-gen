    "intro": "Indigofera craibiana, commonly known as the Craib's indigo, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the environment. Indigofera craibiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
