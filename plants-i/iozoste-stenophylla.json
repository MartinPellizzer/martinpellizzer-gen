    "intro": "Iozoste stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf iozoste, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
