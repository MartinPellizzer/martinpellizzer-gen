It is a herbaceous annual with upright stems and opposite leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
