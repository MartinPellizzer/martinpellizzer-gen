It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Ipomopsis gossypifera produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
