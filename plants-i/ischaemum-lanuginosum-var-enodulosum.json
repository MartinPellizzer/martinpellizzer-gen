It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
