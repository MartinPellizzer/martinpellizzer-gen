    "intro": "Iodes oblonga var. moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Moluccas and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark, leathery fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and rarity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
