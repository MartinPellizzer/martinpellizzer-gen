    "intro": "Isachne hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan isachne, is a species of grass native to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
