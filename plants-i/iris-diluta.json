    "intro": "Iris diluta, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizome, typical of many iris species. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near ponds, marshes, and along stream banks. Iris diluta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
