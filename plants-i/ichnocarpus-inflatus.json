    "intro": "Ichnocarpus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated burr or inflated sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Leguminosae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, woody fruits that resemble small, round balls. These fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to the plant's ability to spread in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
