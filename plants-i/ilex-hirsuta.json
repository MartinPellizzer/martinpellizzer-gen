    "intro": "Ilex hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ilex or the rough holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex hirsuta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
