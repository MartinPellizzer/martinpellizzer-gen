    "intro": "Ipomoea siamensis, commonly known as the Siam morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the early morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, tropical environments. Its seeds are enclosed in capsule fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Ipomoea siamensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
