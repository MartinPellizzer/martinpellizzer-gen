    "intro": "Indigofera cana, commonly known as blue indigo bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Indigofera cana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
