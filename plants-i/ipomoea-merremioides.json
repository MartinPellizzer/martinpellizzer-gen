It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests. Ipomoea merremioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
