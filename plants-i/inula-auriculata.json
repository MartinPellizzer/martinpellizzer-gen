    "intro": "Inula auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate-inula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with gray-green, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with auriculate (ear-shaped) basal lobes, giving it its common name. Inula auriculata is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
