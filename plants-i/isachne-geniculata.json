    "intro": "Isachne geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often exhibit a zigzag pattern along the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Isachne geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
