    "intro": "Ichnanthus affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to eastern North America. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy, pale yellow to greenish flower. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from other plants through its roots. Ichnanthus affinis plays a role in local ecosystems and is often found in association with other orchids and ferns."
