It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
