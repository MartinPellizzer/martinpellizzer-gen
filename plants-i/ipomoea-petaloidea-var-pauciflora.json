It is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral features, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
