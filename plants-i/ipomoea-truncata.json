    "intro": "Ipomoea truncata, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant is a vigorous climber, often seen twining around trees and shrubs in its natural habitat. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea truncata is also known for its edible tubers, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
