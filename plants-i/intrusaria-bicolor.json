    "intro": "Intrusaria bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored intrusaria, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Pertusariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive bicoloration, with the upper surface typically appearing white or pale yellow and the lower surface being darker, often brown or black. The thallus is leprose, meaning it has a granular texture, and the lobes are usually irregular and closely appressed. This lichen is often found on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments. It is a common species in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
