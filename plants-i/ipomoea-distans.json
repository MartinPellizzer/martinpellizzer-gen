    "intro": "Ipomoea distans, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a vine that can climb or spread along the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soils make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species. The seeds are dispersed by birds and animals, contributing to its wide distribution."
