    "intro": "Iris pumila var. scapifera, commonly known as the dwarf iris or scapifera iris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pale blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
