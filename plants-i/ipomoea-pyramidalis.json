    "intro": "Ipomoea pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, typically blooming in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and can grow up to several meters in length. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some areas. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like fruit that splits open when mature."
