    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 germanica var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal iris, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that typically range in color from deep purple to blue, with a distinctive three-lobed petal structure. The plant features sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
