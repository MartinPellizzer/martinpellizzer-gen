    "intro": "Ilex hypopsile, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex hypopsile thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
