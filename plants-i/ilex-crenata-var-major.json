    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. major, commonly known as Japanese holly or Japanese boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage with a slightly serrated edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It is valued in horticulture for its ability to tolerate pruning and its use in topiary and formal garden designs. Ilex crenata var. major thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil."
