    "intro": "Ibidium floridanum, commonly known as the Florida ibidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms and cycads, and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is typically found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
