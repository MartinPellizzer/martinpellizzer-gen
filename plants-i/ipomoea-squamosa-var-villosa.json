    "intro": "Ipomoea squamosa var. villosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and tendrils that help it ascend supports. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
