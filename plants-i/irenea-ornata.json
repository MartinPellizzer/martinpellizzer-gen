    "intro": "Irenea ornata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
