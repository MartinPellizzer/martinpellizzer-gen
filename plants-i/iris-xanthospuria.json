    "intro": "Iris xanthospuria, commonly known as the yellow marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a dark violet throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
