    "intro": "Ilex argentina, commonly known as the Argentine holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Argentina and parts of Chile. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex argentina thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. It is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for local wildlife."
