    "intro": "Isolepis karroica, commonly known as the Karroic flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swampy areas and lake margins. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Isolepis karroica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
