    "intro": "Ipomoea martii, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length, using its tendrils to climb supports. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
