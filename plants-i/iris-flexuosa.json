    "intro": "Iris flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching leaves that form a rosette and its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Iris flexuosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
