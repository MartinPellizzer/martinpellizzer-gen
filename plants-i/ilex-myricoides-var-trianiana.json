    "intro": "Ilex myricoides var. trianiana, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
