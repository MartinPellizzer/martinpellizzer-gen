It features slender, upright stems that produce clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers, which are often used in floral arrangements. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common ornamental and invasive species in many regions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats contribute to its ecological impact."
