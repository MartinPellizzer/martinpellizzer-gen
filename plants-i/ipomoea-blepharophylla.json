    "intro": "Ipomoea blepharophylla, commonly known as the ghostflower or moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pale purple to white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant is a vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique blooming habits and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in night-blooming flora."
