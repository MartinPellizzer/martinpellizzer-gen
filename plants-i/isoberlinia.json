    "intro": "Isoberlinia, commonly known as the African silk tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Sudan. Isoberlinia species are characterized by their deciduous habit, compound leaves, and showy, often pink or purple, flowers that bloom in clusters. The trees are valued for their hard, durable wood and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Additionally, they play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
