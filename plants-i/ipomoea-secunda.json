    "intro": "Ipomoea secunda, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its rapid growth and heliotropic leaves that follow the sun. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. Its vines can climb to great heights, often entwining trees and other structures. Ipomoea secunda is also known for its seeds, which are encased in a fleshy, colorful capsule that splits open when mature."
