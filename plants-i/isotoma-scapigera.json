    "intro": "Isotoma scapigera, commonly known as the scapigerous bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators. Isotoma scapigera is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is relatively low maintenance once established."
