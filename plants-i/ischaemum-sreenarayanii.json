    "intro": "Ischaemum sreenarayanii, commonly known as Sreenarayan's grass, is a species of annual grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along the edges of forests. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
