    "intro": "Ilex umbellata, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex umbellata typically grows in wetland areas and is adapted to moist, acidic soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
