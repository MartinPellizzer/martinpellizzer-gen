    "intro": "Iris spuria subsp. halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking blue to purple flowers. It thrives in saline environments, such as coastal marshes and tidal flats, demonstrating its halophytic nature. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are arranged in dense spikes and are pollinated by insects. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to high-salinity soils and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
