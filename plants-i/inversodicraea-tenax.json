    "intro": "Inversodicraea tenax, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Inversodicraea tenax is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
