It is a rhizomatous perennial herb native to the northern hemisphere, characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are sword-shaped and often have a distinctive white or pale midrib. The flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
