    "intro": "Iris pseudopumila, commonly known as the dwarf iris, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
