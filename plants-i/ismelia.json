It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Ismelia has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in clusters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
