    "intro": "Iris pseudocaucasica subsp. koyuncui, commonly known as the Koyuncu iris, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained environments, and it blooms during the summer months. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its relatively compact flower structure compared to other iris species."
