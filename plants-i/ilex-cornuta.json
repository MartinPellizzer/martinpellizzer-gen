It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Ilex cornuta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with hot, dry climates."
