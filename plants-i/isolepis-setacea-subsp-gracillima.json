    "intro": "Isolepis setacea subsp. gracillima, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, slender spikes of small, greenish flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. This subspecies is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate saline conditions."
