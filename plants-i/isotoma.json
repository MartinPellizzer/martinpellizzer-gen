    "intro": "Isotoma, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears, and its clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. Isotoma thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant is known for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
