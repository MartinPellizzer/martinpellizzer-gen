    "intro": "Ivesia sabulosa, commonly known as sand ivy, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. Ivesia sabulosa is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
