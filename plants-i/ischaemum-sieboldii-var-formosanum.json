    "intro": "Ischaemum sieboldii var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
