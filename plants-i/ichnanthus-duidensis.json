    "intro": "Ichnanthus duidensis, commonly known as the Duidens Island orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas, where it thrives in the unique microclimate of the islands. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air, and it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
