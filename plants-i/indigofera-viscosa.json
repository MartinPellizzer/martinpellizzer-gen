    "intro": "Indigofera viscosa, commonly known as wild indigo, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules. Its fibrous roots and dense growth habit make it a useful plant for erosion control and soil stabilization."
