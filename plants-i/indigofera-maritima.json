    "intro": "Indigofera maritima, commonly known as sea indigo, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often along shorelines. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Sea indigo is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
