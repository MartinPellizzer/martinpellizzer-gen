    "intro": "Isachne multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered isachne, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, greenish or reddish spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Isachne multiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
