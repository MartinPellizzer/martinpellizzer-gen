It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant features pinnately divided leaves with finely toothed margins, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.
