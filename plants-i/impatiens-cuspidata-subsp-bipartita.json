    "intro": "Impatiens cuspidata subsp. bipartita, commonly known as the split-leaved impatiens, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are deeply divided into two main sections, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent yellow throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
