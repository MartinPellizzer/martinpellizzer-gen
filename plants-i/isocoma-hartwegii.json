    "intro": "Isocoma hartwegii, commonly known as Hartweg's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as desert scrub and rocky soils. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it has linear, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Isocoma hartwegii is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
