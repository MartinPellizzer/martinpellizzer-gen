    "intro": "Impatiens urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often stinging leaves that resemble those of the stinging nettle, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and botanically interesting for study."
