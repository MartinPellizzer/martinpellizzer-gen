    "intro": "Ipomoea alpina subsp. argyrophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically opening in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
