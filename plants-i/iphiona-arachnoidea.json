    "intro": "Iphiona arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features a slender, branched stem with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with long, thin petals and a distinctive, hooded labellum. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
