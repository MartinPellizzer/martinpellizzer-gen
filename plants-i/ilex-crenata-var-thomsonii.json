It features dense, glossy dark green foliage with slightly wavy margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in shaded environments. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for topiary and formal garden designs."
