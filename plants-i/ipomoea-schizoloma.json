It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers with a white throat. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its beauty and vigorous growth habit."
