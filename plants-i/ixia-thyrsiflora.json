    "intro": "Ixia thyrsiflora, commonly known as the fireglow lily, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of vibrant orange-red flowers that resemble glowing flames. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, while its roots are fleshy and adapted to store water. Ixia thyrsiflora is well-suited to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
