    "intro": "Isachne micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered isachne, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered inflorescence produces tiny, two-lipped flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. Isachne micrantha plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
