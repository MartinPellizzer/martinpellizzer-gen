    "intro": "Iris bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Iris bornmuelleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
