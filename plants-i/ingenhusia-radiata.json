    "intro": "Ingenhusia radiata, commonly known as the radiate orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble a radiating sun. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in spring and summer, producing a fragrant, nectar-rich display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
