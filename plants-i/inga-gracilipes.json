    "intro": "Inga gracilipes, commonly known as the slender inga, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Inga gracilipes is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports ecological balance in its native habitat."
