    "intro": "Icmane, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the remote highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Icmane thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
