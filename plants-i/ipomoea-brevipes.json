    "intro": "Ipomoea brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and Central America. It produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and a rapid growth habit, often reaching several meters in length. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a day, and are pollinated by insects. The plant is also notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
