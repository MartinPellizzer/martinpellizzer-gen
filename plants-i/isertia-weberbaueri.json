    "intro": "Isertia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's isertia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
