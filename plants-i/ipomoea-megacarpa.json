    "intro": "Ipomoea megacarpa, commonly known as the giant capsule morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but can become a weed in agricultural settings."
