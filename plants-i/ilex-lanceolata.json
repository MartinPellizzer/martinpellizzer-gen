    "intro": "Ilex lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex lanceolata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions."
