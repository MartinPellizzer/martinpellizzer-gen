    "intro": "Inga leucantha, commonly known as white inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy white flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
