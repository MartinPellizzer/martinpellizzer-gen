    "intro": "Illicium majus, commonly known as the greater star anise, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped fruits that resemble the more familiar star anise (Illicium verum). The plant produces yellow flowers followed by dark brown, aromatic berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Illicium majus is valued in traditional medicine and is used in some culinary applications due to its distinctive flavor and essential oils."
