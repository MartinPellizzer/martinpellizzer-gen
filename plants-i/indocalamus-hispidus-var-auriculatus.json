    "intro": "Indocalamus hispidus var. auriculatus, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a variant of the hairy bamboo species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its golden-yellow culms and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a popular ornamental plant. The variant's unique coloration and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to both landscaping and conservation efforts."
