    "intro": "Iberis rhodocarpa, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Iberis rhodocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
