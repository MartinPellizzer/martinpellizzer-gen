    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum f. timorense, commonly known as the Timor grass, is a variant of the species Ischaemum aristatum, which belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to the island of Timor and is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
