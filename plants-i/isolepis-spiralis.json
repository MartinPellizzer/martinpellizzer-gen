    "intro": "Isolepis spiralis, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Isolepis spiralis plays a significant role in wetland restoration and biodiversity support."
