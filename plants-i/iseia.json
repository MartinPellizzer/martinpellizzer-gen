    "intro": "Iseia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the fern family and is characterized by its distinctive silver-green fronds that shimmer in the light. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are composed of multiple pinnae, which are small, feather-like segments. Iseia is not only ornamental but also holds cultural significance among the M\u0101ori people."
