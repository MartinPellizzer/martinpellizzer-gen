    "intro": "Ilex parvifolia, commonly known as the Japanese holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically leathery and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex parvifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a versatile choice for landscaping."
