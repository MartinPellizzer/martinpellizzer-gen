    "intro": "Ipomoea himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 2 meters in height, featuring heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
