    "intro": "Incarvillea diffusa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the spring and early summer. The plant has a woody stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. The plant is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
