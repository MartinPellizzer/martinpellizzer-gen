It belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by reddish-brown berries. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments, typically in moist, shaded areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
