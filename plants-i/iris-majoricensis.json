    "intro": "Iris majoricensis, commonly known as the Majorica Iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the island of Majorca in the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
