    "intro": "Ischnosiphon heleniae, commonly known as the Helen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique structure with a slender, often branched stem and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments, typically growing on rock faces or in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
