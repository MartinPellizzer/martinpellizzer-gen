    "intro": "Inga microgyna, commonly known as the small-leaf inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, showy flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Inga microgyna is often found in moist, shaded habitats and plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its rapid growth makes it useful for soil stabilization and reforestation efforts."
