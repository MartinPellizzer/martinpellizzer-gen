It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are slightly wavy at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds, adding ornamental value in the winter months. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hedges, rock gardens, or as a foundation plant in landscape designs."
