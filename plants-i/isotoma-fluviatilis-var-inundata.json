    "intro": "Isotoma fluviatilis var. inundata, commonly known as the water forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It features delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across muddy or aquatic habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions. This variety is often found in marshes, streambanks, and other moist environments where it thrives in partial to full shade."
