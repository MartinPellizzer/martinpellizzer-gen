    "intro": "Ilex micrococca f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy ilex or hairy holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the humid forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinct texture. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and seasonal fruit display."
