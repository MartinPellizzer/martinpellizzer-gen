    "intro": "Impatiens gibbosa, commonly known as the waxy bilberry, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, blue-violet berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Impatiens gibbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
