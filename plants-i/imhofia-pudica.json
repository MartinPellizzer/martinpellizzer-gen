    "intro": "Imhofia pudica, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water surface. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are broad and floating, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the surrounding sediment. Imhofia pudica is also valued for its cultural and medicinal significance in many traditional practices."
