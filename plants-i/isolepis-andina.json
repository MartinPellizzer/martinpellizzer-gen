    "intro": "Isolepis andina, commonly known as Andean bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its dense, fibrous growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, lakes, and along the edges of streams. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Isolepis andina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
