It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has rounded, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
