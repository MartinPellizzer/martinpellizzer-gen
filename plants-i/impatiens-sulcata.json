    "intro": "Impatiens sulcata, commonly known as the wavy-leaved impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy or serrated leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Impatiens sulcata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
