    "intro": "Impatiens boinensis, commonly known as the Bornean impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is a member of the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to red. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
