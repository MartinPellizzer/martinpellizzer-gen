It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 feet and features dense, dark green foliage with small, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact size and year-round foliage make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
