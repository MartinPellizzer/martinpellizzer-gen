    "intro": "Inga histrix, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
