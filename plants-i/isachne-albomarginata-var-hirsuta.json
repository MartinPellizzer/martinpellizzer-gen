    "intro": "Isachne albomarginata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy margin grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and floodplains. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. The variety *hirsuta* is distinguished by its hairy texture on the leaf blades and stems, which aids in its identification."
