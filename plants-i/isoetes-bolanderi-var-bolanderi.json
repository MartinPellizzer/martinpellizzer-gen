    "intro": "Isoetes bolanderi var. bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure on the bottom of freshwater habitats. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving waters, such as lakes and ponds, where it can thrive in shallow, muddy substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, spike-like arrangement at the base of the plant. This variety is native to western North America and is often used as an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
