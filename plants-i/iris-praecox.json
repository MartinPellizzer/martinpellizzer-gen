    "intro": "Iris praecox, commonly known as the early iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Iris praecox prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
