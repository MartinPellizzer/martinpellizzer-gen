    "intro": "Iris sibirica var. trigonocarpa, commonly known as the Siberian iris, is a perennial plant native to the cold regions of Asia and Europe. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers have three upright petals and three spreading sepals, which are characteristic of the iris family."
