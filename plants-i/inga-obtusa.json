    "intro": "Inga obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often broad and elliptical in shape. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces pods that contain edible seeds. Inga obtusa is also valued for its role in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and ability to provide shade for other crops."
