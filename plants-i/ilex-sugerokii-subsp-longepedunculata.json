    "intro": "Ilex sugerokii subsp. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
