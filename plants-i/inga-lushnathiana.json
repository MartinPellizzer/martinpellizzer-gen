    "intro": "Inga lushnathiana, commonly known as the Lushnath's inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Inga lushnathiana is often used in agroforestry systems due to its fast growth and shade-providing capabilities."
