    "intro": "Isnardia cylindrica, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, cylindrical stems and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in slow-moving waters and thrives in nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may extend into the water column. The botanical features of Isnardia cylindrica are adapted for efficient nutrient absorption through both photosynthesis and predation."
