It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from purple to blue in color. The plant blooms profusely during the day, particularly in warm weather, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The seeds are encased in a fleshy, colorful capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature."
