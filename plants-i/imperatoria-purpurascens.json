    "intro": "Imperatoria purpurascens, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red bark and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a woody stem with a thick, corky layer that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Imperatoria purpurascens is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in craftsmanship and as a source of dye."
