It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has a woody stem with alternate leaves. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators. Idiogramma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
