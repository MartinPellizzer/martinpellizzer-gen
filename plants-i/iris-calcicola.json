    "intro": "Iris calcicola, commonly known as the caliche iris, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces showy blue to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its bloom period is short, making it a striking but rare sight in its native environment. Iris calcicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in challenging, dry conditions."
