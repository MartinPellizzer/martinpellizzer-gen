    "intro": "Ibatia foetida, commonly known as the stinking ibatia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its ornamental appeal, the plant has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores."
