    "intro": "Inga panurensis, commonly known as the panurensis inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and can thrive in partial to full sunlight. Inga panurensis is also valued for its potential in agroforestry due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and shade-providing canopy."
