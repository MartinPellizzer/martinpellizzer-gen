    "intro": "Isopogon tripartitus, commonly known as the three-part banksia, is a flowering plant native to southwestern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, cone-like inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and features narrow, leathery leaves. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Isopogon tripartitus is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
