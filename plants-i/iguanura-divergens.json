    "intro": "Iguanura divergens, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in disturbed or disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor conditions make it an invasive species in some regions."
