    "intro": "Iris stolonifera var. vaga, commonly known as the wandering iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through stolons. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
