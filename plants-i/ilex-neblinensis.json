    "intro": "Ilex neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Ilex neblinensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
