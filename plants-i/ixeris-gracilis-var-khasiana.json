It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellow composite flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
