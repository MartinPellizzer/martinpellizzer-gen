    "intro": "Inga capuchoi, commonly known as the chocolate tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible pods. The seeds inside the pods are often used in traditional medicine and have a mild chocolate flavor, hence the common name. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
