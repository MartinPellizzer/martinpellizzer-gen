    "intro": "Ipomoea magnifica, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a striking flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and drought tolerance. However, its sharp thorns and toxic sap make it potentially hazardous to handle without care."
