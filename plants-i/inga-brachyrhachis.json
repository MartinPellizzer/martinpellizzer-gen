    "intro": "Inga brachyrhachis, commonly known as the short-stemmed inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Inga brachyrhachis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its natural habitat."
