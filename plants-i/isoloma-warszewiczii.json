    "intro": "Isoloma warszewiczii, commonly known as the Warszewicz's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
