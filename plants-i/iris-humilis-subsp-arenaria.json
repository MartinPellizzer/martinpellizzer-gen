    "intro": "Iris humilis subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces delicate, blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, characteristic of the Iris genus. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
