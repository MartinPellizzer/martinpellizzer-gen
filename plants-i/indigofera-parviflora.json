It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods that contain small, dark seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Indigofera parviflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
