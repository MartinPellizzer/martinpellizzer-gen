It features dense, glossy dark green foliage with a distinctive scalloped leaf margin. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its slow growth and compact form. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in landscaping."
