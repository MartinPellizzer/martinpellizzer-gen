    "intro": "Iberis integerrima, commonly known as the hardy candytuft, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage consists of dense, gray-green, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white fuzz. Iberis integerrima is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for perennial gardens."
