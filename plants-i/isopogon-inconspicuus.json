    "intro": "Isopogon inconspicuus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking yellow to orange flowers that appear in dense, cylindrical spikes. The plant is part of the Proteaceae family and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. It typically grows in heathlands and coastal areas, often forming dense thickets. Isopogon inconspicuus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
