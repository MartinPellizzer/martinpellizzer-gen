    "intro": "Iberis pinnata var. bicorymbifera, commonly known as the two-corymb wild cabbage, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in compact corymbs. The leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of whitish, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar structural and chemical traits."
