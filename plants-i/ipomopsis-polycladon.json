    "intro": "Ipomopsis polycladon, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in the late afternoon and remain open through the night. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds."
