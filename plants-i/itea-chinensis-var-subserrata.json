It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with finely serrated margins that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes and wetland restoration projects."
