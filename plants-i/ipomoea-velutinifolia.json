    "intro": "Ipomoea velutinifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many parts of the world."
