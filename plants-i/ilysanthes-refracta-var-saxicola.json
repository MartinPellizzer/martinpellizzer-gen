    "intro": "Ilysanthes refracta var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to extreme climates and a valuable component of high-altitude ecosystems."
