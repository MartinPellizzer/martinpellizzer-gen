    "intro": "Inga peckii, commonly known as the Peck's inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate, and its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink. Inga peckii is a fast-growing tree or shrub that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it a valuable component of forest ecosystems. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
