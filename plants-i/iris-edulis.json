    "intro": "Iris edulis, commonly known as the edible iris, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its leaves are sword-shaped and can reach several feet in length. While the flowers are ornamental, the rhizomes and roots are sometimes used in traditional cuisines, though caution is advised due to potential toxicity."
