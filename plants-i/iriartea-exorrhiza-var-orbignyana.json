    "intro": "Iriartea exorrhiza var. orbignyana, commonly known as the Orinoco puya, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, often colorful, strap-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and conservation purposes."
