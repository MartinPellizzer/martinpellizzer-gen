    "intro": "Ilex pseudogodajam, commonly known as the Indian holly, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening in warm climates. Ilex pseudogodajam is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban environments."
