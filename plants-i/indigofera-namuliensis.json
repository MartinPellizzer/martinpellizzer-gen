It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be dispersed by wind or animals. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has potential for use in traditional medicine."
