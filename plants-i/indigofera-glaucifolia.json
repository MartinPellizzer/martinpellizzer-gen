    "intro": "Indigofera glaucifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that often have a silvery or bluish-gray underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Indigofera glaucifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
