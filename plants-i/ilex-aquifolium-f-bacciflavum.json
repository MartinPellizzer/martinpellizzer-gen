    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium f. bacciflavum, commonly known as the golden berry holly, is a botanical variant of the common holly. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-red berries, which contrast with the typical dark red or black berries of the standard species. The plant retains the typical holly morphology, with glossy, spiny leaves and a dense, evergreen habit. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and unique fruit coloration. This form is particularly valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings."
