    "intro": "Iresine wallisii, commonly known as the flame flower or red leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, bi-color leaves that range from deep red to dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or white, which appear in clusters at the base of the leaves. Iresine wallisii thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage."
