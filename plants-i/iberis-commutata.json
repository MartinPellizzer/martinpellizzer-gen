    "intro": "Iberis commutata, commonly known as the white flowering candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage that is typically gray-green in color, with small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value. Iberis commutata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
