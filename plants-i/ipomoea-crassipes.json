    "intro": "Ipomoea crassipes, commonly known as water spinach or kangkong, is a tropical aquatic plant characterized by its fleshy, edible leaves and long,\u530d\u5310 stems that can root at nodes. It thrives in shallow waters, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds, often forming dense mats that can alter water flow and nutrient dynamics. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically short-lived. It is native to Southeast Asia but has been introduced to many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
