    "intro": "Iberis cottiana, commonly known as candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
