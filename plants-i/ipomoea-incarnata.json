    "intro": "Ipomoea incarnata, commonly known as scarlet morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking red, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or fences. It is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
