    "intro": "Ilex bumelioides, commonly known as the swamp holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex bumelioides thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
