It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are usually pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Indigofera rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
