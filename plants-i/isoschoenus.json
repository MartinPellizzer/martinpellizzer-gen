It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Isoschoenus species are typically found in wet or moist environments, such as seeps, marshes, and stream banks. These plants play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
