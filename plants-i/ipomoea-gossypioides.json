    "intro": "Ipomoea gossypioides, commonly known as the cottonleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is notable for its relationship to the cotton plant, as it is the source of the wild cotton fiber used in textile production."
