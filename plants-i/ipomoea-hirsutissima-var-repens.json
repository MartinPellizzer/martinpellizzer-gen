    "intro": "Ipomoea hirsutissima var. repens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant spreads via runners, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in gardens."
