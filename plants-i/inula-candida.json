    "intro": "Inula candida, commonly known as the white elecampane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, yellow composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Inula candida is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
