    "intro": "Islaya islayensis, commonly known as the Islay endemic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the island of Islay in Scotland. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as peat bogs and coastal heaths, where it forms dense colonies. Its unique morphology includes a short, fleshy rhizome and narrow, strap-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Islaya islayensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
