    "intro": "Ischyrolepis sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring. Ischyrolepis sieberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
