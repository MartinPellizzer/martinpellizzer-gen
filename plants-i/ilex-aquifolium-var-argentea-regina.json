It features striking, dark green, oval leaves that are edged with silvery-white teeth, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries in the winter, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedging. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round foliage and seasonal fruiting."
