    "intro": "Inga arenicola, commonly known as the sand inga, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in coastal or disturbed areas. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated pods containing flat, winged seeds. Due to its adaptability, Inga arenicola is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
