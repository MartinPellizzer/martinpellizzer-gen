    "intro": "Inga samanensis, commonly known as the \"saman\" or \"wild silk tree,\" is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, and its distinctive, umbrella-shaped canopy. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Inga samanensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
