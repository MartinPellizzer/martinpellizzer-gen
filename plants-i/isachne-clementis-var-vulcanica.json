    "intro": "Isachne clementis var. vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic isachne, is a rare grass species native to volcanic soils in tropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
