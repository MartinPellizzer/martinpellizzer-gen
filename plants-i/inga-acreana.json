    "intro": "Inga acreana, commonly known as the Amazonian velvet bean, is a leguminous shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Inga acreana is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it an important plant in agroforestry systems."
