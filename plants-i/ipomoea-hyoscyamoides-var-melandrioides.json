    "intro": "Ipomoea hyoscyamoides var. melandrioides, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, yellow flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and can grow as a vine or shrub, depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, round berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates."
