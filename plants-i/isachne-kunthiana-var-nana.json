    "intro": "Isachne kunthiana var. nana, commonly known as dwarf isachne, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, forming dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its compact size and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
