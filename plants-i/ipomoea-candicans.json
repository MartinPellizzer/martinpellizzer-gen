    "intro": "Ipomoea candicans, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Central America. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically opening in the morning and closing by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are usually a deep green. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for covering trellises or fences. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
