    "intro": "Inga englesingii, commonly known as the white inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Inga englesingii is often found in moist forest understories and is valued for its timber and ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
