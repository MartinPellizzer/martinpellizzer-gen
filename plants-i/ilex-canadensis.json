    "intro": "Ilex canadensis, commonly known as the American holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically spiny and alternate along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex canadensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
