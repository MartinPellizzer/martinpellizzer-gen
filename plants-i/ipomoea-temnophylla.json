    "intro": "Ipomoea temnophylla, commonly known as the red-veined morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with striking red veins and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. Its rapid growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can become invasive if not controlled. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature."
