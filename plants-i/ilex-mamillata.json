    "intro": "Ilex mamillata, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with small, raised glands, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex mamillata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dense foliage and seasonal color changes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscaping in warmer climates."
