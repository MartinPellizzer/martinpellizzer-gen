It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of bright pink or white flowers. The plant features small, lobed leaves and thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. It is well adapted to coastal environments due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. The Gibraltar carnation is also cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
