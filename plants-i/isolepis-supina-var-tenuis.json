    "intro": "Isolepis supina var. tenuis, commonly known as slender spikerush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and pond margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in suitable habitats. This variety is characterized by its shorter, more slender stems compared to the typical form of Isolepis supina."
