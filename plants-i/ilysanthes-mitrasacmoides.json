    "intro": "Ilysanthes mitrasacmoides, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, soft pubescence. Its unique floral structure includes a specialized lip petal that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
