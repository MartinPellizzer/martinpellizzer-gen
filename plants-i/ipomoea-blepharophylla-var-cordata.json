    "intro": "Ipomoea blepharophylla var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf morning glory, is a striking tropical vine native to Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to deep purple. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blooms that open in the morning and close by midday. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and as a climbing plant. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
