    "intro": "Inga uraguensis f. tomentosula, commonly known as the woolly inga, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil in its native habitat. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
