    "intro": "Indigofera placida, commonly known as the sweet indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Indigofera placida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
