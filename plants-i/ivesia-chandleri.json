    "intro": "Ivesia chandleri, commonly known as Chandler's ivesia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ivesia chandleri is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
