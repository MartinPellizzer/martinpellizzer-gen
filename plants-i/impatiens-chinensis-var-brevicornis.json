It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
