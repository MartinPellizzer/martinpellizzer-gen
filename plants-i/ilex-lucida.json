    "intro": "Ilex lucida, commonly known as the shining oak, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, oblong berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex lucida typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a humid climate."
