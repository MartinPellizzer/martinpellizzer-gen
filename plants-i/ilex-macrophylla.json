    "intro": "Ilex macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of other holly species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Ilex macrophylla thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense foliage and year-round structure provide valuable habitat and visual interest in gardens and natural areas."
