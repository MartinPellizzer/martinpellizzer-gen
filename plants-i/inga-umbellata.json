    "intro": "Inga umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella tree or white inga, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy formed by its large, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. The plant has a shallow root system and is known for its rapid growth, making it a valuable species for reforestation efforts."
