    "intro": "Ilex duarteensis, commonly known as Duarte's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate to high humidity. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
