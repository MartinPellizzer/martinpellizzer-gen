It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is valued in horticulture for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This form is particularly noted for its slower growth and compact size, making it suitable for small gardens or container planting."
