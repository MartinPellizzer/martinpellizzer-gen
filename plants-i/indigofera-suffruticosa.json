    "intro": "Indigofera suffruticosa, commonly known as Brazilian indigo or wild indigo, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces pods containing seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has been historically used for dye production and has ecological significance as a source of nectar for pollinators."
