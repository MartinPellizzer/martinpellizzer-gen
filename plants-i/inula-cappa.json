    "intro": "Inula cappa, commonly known as the narrowleaf elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, leafy stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, forming a rounded head that resembles a dandelion. Inula cappa is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
