    "intro": "Ipomoea futilis, commonly known as the \"futile morning glory,\" is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and has a climbing habit, often used in ornamental gardening. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Ipomoea futilis is also known for its short blooming period, typically during the early morning hours."
