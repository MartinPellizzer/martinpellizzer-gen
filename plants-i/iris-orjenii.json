    "intro": "Iris orjenii, commonly known as the Kordiyak iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture.
