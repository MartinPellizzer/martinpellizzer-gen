    "intro": "Iberis linifolia var. contracta, commonly known as the dwarf candytuft, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of small, white flowers. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant has aromatic, gray-green foliage that is covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact size and ornamental value. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch of white to the landscape."
