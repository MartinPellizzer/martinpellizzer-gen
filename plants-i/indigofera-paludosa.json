    "intro": "Indigofera paludosa, commonly known as swamp indigo, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Indigofera paludosa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
