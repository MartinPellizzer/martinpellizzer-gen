    "intro": "Inula rhizantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf elecampane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems are usually tall and robust, bearing yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets. The rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and often invasive species in its native habitats."
