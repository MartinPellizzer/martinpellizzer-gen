    "intro": "Iris lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Iris lusitanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been historically used in traditional medicine."
