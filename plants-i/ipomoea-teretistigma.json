    "intro": "Ipomoea teretistigma, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in ornamental gardens. The seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, fleshy capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
