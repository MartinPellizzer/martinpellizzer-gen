    "intro": "Impatiens imbecilla, commonly known as the dwarf impatiens, is a species of flowering plant in the family Balsaminaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, spurred flowers that come in shades of pink and white. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and vibrant blooms. However, it is relatively sensitive to environmental stress and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish."
