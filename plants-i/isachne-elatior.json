    "intro": "Isachne elatior, commonly known as the greater false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet at the top of the stem, bearing small, two-ranked spikelets. Isachne elatior is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
