It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover or ornamental plant in gardens. Ipomoea pseudorubicunda is also known for its nocturnal blooming pattern, with flowers opening in the early evening."
