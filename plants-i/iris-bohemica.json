    "intro": "Iris bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and stiff. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland or meadow habitats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native range."
