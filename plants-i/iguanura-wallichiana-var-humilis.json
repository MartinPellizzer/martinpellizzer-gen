It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
