    "intro": "Ichnanthus leiocarpus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothpod ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features slender, erect stems that are typically covered with short, appressed hairs, though the variety glabrescens has a smoother appearance. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spire-like inflorescences. The plant's leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, textured surface, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats."
