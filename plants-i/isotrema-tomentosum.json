    "intro": "Isotrema tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly isotrema, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
