    "intro": "Ipomoea velutipes, commonly known as the velvet leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a climbing vine that produces showy blooms, often at dawn, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
