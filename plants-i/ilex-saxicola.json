    "intro": "Ilex saxicola, commonly known as the rock holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, glossy leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex saxicola thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock garden displays."
