    "intro": "Imeria memorabilis var. memorabilis, commonly known as the rare mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. It blooms in late summer, producing clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
