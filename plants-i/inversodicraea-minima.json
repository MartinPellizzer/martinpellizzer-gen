It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often densely packed. It produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
