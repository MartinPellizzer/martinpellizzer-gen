    "intro": "Isocoma vernonioides, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is typically found in dry, sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the summer, producing yellow or white petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
