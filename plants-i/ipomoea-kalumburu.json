    "intro": "Ipomoea kalumburu, commonly known as the Kalumburu morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It produces strikingly large, showy flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red, often with intricate patterns. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, and its stems are hairy and twining. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or wetland habitats. The flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated primarily by birds and insects."
