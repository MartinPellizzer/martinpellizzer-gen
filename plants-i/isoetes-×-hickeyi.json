    "intro": "Isoetes \u00d7 hickeyi, commonly known as the Hickey's watermilfoil, is a hybrid species of the genus Isoetes, which belongs to the family Isoetaceae. It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a central axis called a strobilus. The plant is native to North America and is often found in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its morphology includes long, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted for underwater growth. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that can make it challenging to distinguish from its parent species."
