    "intro": "Illecebrum serpyllifolium, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes, rock crevices, and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
