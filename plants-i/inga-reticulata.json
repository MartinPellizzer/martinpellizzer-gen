    "intro": "Inga reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment in agroforestry systems. Inga reticulata is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a useful species in forest restoration projects."
