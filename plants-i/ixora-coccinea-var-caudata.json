It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hedge due to its hardy nature and long-lasting blooms."
