    "intro": "Iris stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and grows from rhizomes that spread horizontally underground. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time."
