It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Isolepis bufonia is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
