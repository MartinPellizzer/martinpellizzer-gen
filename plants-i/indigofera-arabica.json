    "intro": "Indigofera arabica, commonly known as the Arabian indigo plant, is a species of legume native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Historically, it has been used for its dye-producing properties, though its cultivation has declined in modern times."
