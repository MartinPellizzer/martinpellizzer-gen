    "intro": "Ipomoea crassipes f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed waterhyacinth, is a variant of the waterhyacinth species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to the typical waterhyacinth. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy. Its flowers are typically violet or blue, with five petals and prominent stamens. This form is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can form dense mats on the water surface."
