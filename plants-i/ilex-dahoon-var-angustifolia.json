    "intro": "Ilex dahoon var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf inkberry, is a deciduous evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
