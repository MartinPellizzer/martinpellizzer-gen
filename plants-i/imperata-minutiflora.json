    "intro": "Imperata minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cogon grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale brown flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
