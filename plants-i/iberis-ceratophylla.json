    "intro": "Iberis ceratophylla, commonly known as the Turkish carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant features small, rounded leaves and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The botanical name reflects its distinctive foliage, with \"ceratophylla\" referring to its horn-like leaf structure."
