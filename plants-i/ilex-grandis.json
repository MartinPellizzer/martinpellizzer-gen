    "intro": "Ilex grandis, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various birds and wildlife. Ilex grandis is often used in landscaping due to its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
