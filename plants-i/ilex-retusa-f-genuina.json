    "intro": "Ilex retusa f. genuina, commonly known as the smoothleaf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and slightly waxy to the touch. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its dense, upright growth habit. Its ornamental value comes from its year-round foliage and ability to maintain its form in various garden settings."
