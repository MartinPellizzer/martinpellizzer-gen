It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and oval in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Ilex glabella is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
