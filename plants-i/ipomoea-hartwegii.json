    "intro": "Ipomoea hartwegii, commonly known as Hartweg's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing vines and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces pentagonal, five-lobed leaves and has hairy stems that help it adhere to surfaces. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Ipomoea hartwegii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
