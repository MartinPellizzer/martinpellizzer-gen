    "intro": "Iris clusiana, commonly known as the Clusian iris, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The showy blooms appear in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
