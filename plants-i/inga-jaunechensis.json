    "intro": "Inga jaunechensis, commonly known as the yellow inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its showy, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruits are legumes, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant's rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it ecologically significant in forest ecosystems."
