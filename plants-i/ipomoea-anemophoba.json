It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit make it a notable species in botanical studies. Ipomoea anemophoba is also known for its fragility, as its flowers are easily damaged by wind or touch."
