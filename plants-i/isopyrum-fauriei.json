    "intro": "Isopyrum fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, appear in clusters and bloom in early summer."
