    "intro": "Isolepis mesantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, bogs, and the margins of lakes and rivers. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Isolepis mesantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
