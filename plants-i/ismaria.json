    "intro": "Ismaria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Ismaria thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
