    "intro": "Irmischia suberosa, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rocky or sandy gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Irmischia suberosa is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
