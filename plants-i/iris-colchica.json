    "intro": "Iris colchica, commonly known as the Colchic iris, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. Iris colchica is also notable for its historical association with the myth of the Colchian kingdom and its medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
