    "intro": "Ilex venosa, commonly known as the variegated holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow veins, which give it its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds, contributing to its ecological value. Ilex venosa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often used in landscaping for its year-round visual interest and hardiness."
