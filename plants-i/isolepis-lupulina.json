    "intro": "Isolepis lupulina, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, often playing a key role in stabilizing wetland soils. Isolepis lupulina is also valued for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
