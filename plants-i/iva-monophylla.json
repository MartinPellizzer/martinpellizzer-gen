It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, ditches, and wetlands. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Iva monophylla is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
