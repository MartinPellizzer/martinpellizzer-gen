It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
