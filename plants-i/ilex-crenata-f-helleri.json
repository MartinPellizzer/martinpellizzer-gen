    "intro": "Ilex crenata f. helleri, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves with a slightly wavy margin, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It is widely used in horticulture as a ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and year-round foliage. Ilex crenata f. helleri thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil."
