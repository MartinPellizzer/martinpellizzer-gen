    "intro": "Isonandra dasyphylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Isonandra dasyphylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
