It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces tendrils that help it climb and spread along supports. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant colors and rapid growth habit. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
