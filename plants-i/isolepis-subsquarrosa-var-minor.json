    "intro": "Isolepis subsquarrosa var. minor, commonly known as the small-squamose sedgeland, is a variant of the isolepis genus native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and thrives in marshy or pond margins. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. This variety is often found in temperate regions with high humidity and consistent moisture."
