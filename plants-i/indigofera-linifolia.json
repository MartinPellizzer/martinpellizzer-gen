It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Silky indigo is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine and dyeing practices."
