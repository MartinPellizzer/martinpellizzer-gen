    "intro": "Inga sericantha, commonly known as the yellow inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The tree is valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
