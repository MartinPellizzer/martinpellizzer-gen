    "intro": "Ilex pubiflora var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and evergreen foliage."
