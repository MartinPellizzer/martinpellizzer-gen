It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. Icacorea reflexa is well adapted to salt spray and is an important species in coastal ecosystems."
