    "intro": "Isoetes maritima var. flettii, commonly known as the Flett's watermace, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes, which includes species of spike mosses. It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically submerged in water. This variety is native to specific coastal regions and thrives in brackish or freshwater environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for aquatic life. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
