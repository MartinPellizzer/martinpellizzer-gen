    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. argentea-longifolia, commonly known as the silver-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The leaves are elongated and have a leathery texture, typical of the Ilex genus. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
