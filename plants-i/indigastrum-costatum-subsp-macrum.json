    "intro": "Indigastrum costatum subsp. macrum, commonly known as the broad-leafed indigastrum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
