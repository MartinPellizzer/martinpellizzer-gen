It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex cognata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal contribute to its widespread use in gardens and natural habitats."
