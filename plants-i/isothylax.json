    "intro": "Isothylax, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Isothylax blooms during the rainy season, adding a vibrant splash of color to its natural habitat."
