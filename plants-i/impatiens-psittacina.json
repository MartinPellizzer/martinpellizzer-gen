It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny showers, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Impatiens psittacina thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
