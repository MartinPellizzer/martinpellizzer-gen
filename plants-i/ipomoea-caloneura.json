    "intro": "Ipomoea caloneura, commonly known as the waxy leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a vine that can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing or trailing along supports. It blooms during the day, typically in the morning, and is known for its rapid growth and ornamental value. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
