    "intro": "Isolepis elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Isolepis elliottii is an important component of wetland ecosystems, playing a role in water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
