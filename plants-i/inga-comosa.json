    "intro": "Inga comosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in panicles. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain edible seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Inga comosa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
