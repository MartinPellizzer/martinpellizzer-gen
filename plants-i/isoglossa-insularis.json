    "intro": "Isoglossa insularis, commonly known as the island isoglossa, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island ecosystems. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isoglossa insularis is considered a vulnerable species."
