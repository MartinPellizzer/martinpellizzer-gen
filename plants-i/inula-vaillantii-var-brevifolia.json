    "intro": "Inula vaillantii var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved elecampane, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features robust, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety. Its yellow flower heads consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the genus Inula. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and medicinal properties."
