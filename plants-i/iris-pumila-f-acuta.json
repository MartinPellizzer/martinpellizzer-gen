    "intro": "Iris pumila f. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved dwarf iris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are distinctly pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed petal structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
