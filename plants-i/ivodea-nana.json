    "intro": "Ivodea nana, commonly known as dwarf ivy, is a small, evergreen perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats of foliage that help insulate the soil. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Ivodea nana is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
