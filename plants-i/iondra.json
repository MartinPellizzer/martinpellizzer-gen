    "intro": "Iondra, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and mystical plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking violet and white petals, which emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Iondra is often associated with spiritual and medicinal properties in indigenous cultures. Due to its endangered status, it is protected and cultivated only in specialized botanical gardens."
