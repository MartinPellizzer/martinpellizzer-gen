    "intro": "Incarum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Incarum is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in mountainous areas. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability, making it a resilient and hardy species."
