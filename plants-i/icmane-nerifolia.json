    "intro": "Icmane nerifolia, commonly known as the coastal mistplant, is a flowering plant native to the humid coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, delicate white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing near tidal zones or in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Icmane nerifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its resilience and aesthetic qualities."
