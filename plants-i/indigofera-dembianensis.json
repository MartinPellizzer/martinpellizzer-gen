    "intro": "Indigofera dembianensis, commonly known as the Dembien indigo plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. Indigofera dembianensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
