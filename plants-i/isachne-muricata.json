    "intro": "Isachne muricata, commonly known as the hairy isachne, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Isachne muricata is adapted to a variety of habitats, including wetlands and grassy areas, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
