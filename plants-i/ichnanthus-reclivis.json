    "intro": "Ichnanthus reclivis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Ichnanthus reclivis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
