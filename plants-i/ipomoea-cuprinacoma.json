    "intro": "Ipomoea cuprinacoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant can become invasive in certain environments. The genus Ipomoea includes many species with ornamental value, but I. cuprinacoma is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relatives."
