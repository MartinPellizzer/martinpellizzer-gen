    "intro": "Ixora rosacea, commonly known as the rose hedge or rose bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms. Ixora rosacea is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
