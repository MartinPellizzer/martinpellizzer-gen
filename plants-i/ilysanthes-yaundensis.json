    "intro": "Ilysanthes yaundensis, commonly known as the Yaound\u00e9 starling, is a rare flowering plant native to Cameroon. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
