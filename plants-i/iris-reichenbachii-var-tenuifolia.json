    "intro": "Iris reichenbachii var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaved iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, typically ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
