    "intro": "Indigofera litoralis, commonly known as coastal indigo, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Indigofera litoralis is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
