It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with branches drooping gracefully from the main stem. The plant features dark green, holly-like leaves that are glossy and have serrated edges. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This ornamental shrub is often used in landscaping for its unique visual appeal and evergreen foliage."
