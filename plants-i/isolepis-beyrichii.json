    "intro": "Isolepis beyrichii, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often narrow and tapering, with a distinctive beak-like tip on its seed heads. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet that is often curved or bent. Isolepis beyrichii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
