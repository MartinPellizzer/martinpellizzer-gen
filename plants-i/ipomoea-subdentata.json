It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its climbing habit, often twisting around supports or other vegetation. Its flowers open in the morning and close by late afternoon, hence its common name.
