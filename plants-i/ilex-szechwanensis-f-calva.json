    "intro": "Ilex szechwanensis f. calva, commonly known as the Sichuan holly, is a variant of the Sichuan holly, a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, grayish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild winters."
