    "intro": "Inga umbratica, commonly known as the shadow acacia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that provides shade, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Inga umbratica is often found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation within forest ecosystems."
