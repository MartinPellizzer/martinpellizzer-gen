    "intro": "Impatiens noli-tangere var. pallescens, commonly known as the ghost impatiens, is a strikingly pale, almost translucent variant of the impatiens genus. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a ghostly white or pale green hue. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its delicate appearance and unique coloration make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
