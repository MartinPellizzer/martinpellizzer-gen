    "intro": "Iria junciformis, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Iria junciformis thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
