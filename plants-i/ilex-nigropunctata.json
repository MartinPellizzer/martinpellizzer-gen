    "intro": "Ilex nigropunctata, commonly known as the black-spotted holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are adorned with small, black dots, which are actually raised oil glands. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. Ilex nigropunctata typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable climate conditions."
