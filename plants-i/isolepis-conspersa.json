    "intro": "Isolepis conspersa, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-ranked flowers. Isolepis conspersa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
