    "intro": "Ireon, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in the remote highlands of Madagascar. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble the skin of a ghost, giving it its eerie common name. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are deeply embedded in the soil, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Ireon is highly valued in both botanical research and traditional medicine."
