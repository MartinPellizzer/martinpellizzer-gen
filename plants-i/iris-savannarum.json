It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Iris savannarum plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
