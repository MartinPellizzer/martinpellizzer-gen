    "intro": "Isolepis falcata, commonly known as the swordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Isolepis falcata thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
