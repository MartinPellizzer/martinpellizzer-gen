    "intro": "Ixia bulbocodium var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf yellow bulbous orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous structure that stores nutrients for growth. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal that resembles a small horn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively small size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
