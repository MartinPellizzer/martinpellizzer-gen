    "intro": "Intsia tashiroi, commonly known as the Japanese ironwood, is a rare and endangered species native to southern Japan. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dark, heavy wood and dense foliage. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Intsia tashiroi is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
