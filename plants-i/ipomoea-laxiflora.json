It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, pale blue to white flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces cylindrical, red or orange berries that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. Ipomoea laxiflora is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to support its growth."
