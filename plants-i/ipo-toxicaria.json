    "intro": "Ipo toxicaria, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which also includes tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces dark purple berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of solanine and other alkaloids. Its leaves and flowers contain similar toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested. Despite its dangerous nature, it has been historically used in medicine and magic."
