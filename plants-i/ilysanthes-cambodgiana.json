    "intro": "Ilysanthes cambodgiana, commonly known as the Cambodian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Cambodia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, clustered fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Ilysanthes cambodgiana remains a poorly understood and endangered species."
