    "intro": "Ilex megacarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it grows in wetland habitats. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of glossy, dark green leaves with serrated margins. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant's ornamental value is due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
