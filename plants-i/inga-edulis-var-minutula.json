    "intro": "Inga edulis var. minutula, commonly known as the small-fruited cupuacu, is a shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are smaller and less bitter than those of the standard Inga edulis. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring in local cuisines. Its growth habit and ecological role make it an important species in tropical ecosystems."
