It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods containing lens-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it an important plant in agroforestry systems."
