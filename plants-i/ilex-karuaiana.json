    "intro": "Ilex karuaiana, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the island of Kaua\u02bbi in Hawaii and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and upland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex karuaiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
