    "intro": "Ilex racemosa, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex racemosa typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
