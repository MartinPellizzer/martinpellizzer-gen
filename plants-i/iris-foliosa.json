    "intro": "Iris foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are broad and often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Iris foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
