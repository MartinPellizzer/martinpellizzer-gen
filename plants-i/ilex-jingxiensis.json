    "intro": "Ilex jingxiensis, commonly known as the Jingxi holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically bird-dispersed, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex jingxiensis is considered an endangered species."
