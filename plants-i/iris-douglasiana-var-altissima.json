    "intro": "Iris douglasiana var. altissima, commonly known as the Sierra iris, is a striking perennial herb native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to six feet, adorned with showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, typical of many iris species. Its flowers are usually arranged in a single spike, with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions."
