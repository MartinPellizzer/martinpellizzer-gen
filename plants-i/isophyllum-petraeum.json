    "intro": "Isophyllum petraeum, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid environments. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, showy yellow flowers with six petals. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry habitats."
