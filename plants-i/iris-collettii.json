    "intro": "Iris collettii, commonly known as the Collett's iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil and store nutrients. Iris collettii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
