It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, typical of the legume family. It thrives in coastal and upland habitats, often found in dry, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
