    "intro": "Impatiens kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon Impatiens, is a flowering plant native to Cameroon and neighboring regions in Central Africa. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its showy, delicate flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when mature. Impatiens kamerunensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small organisms."
