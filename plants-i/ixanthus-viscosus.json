    "intro": "Ixanthus viscosus, commonly known as sticky ixanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is notable for its sticky resinous secretions, which coat its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. The botanical features of Ixanthus viscosus make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
