    "intro": "Iris propendens, commonly known as the leaning iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often bend or lean, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three downward-curving sepals. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in moist, clay-rich soils. Iris propendens is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
