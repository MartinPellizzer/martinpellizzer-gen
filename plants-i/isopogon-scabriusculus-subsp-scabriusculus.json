    "intro": "Isopogon scabriusculus subsp. scabriusculus, commonly known as the rough-leaved isopogon, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
