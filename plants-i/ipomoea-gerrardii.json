    "intro": "Ipomoea gerrardii, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can become invasive if not managed. The flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
