    "intro": "Inula helvetica var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Swiss Inula, is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in alpine and subalpine regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a sturdy, branched stem covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often covered in a fine white down. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to other Inula species."
