    "intro": "Impatiens anjawensis, commonly known as the Anjaw impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically come in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky areas. Its foliage is usually heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
