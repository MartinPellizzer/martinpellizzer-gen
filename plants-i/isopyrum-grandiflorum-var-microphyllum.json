    "intro": "Isopyrum grandiflorum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Isopyrum grandiflorum."
