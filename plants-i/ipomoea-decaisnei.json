    "intro": "Ipomoea decaisnei, commonly known as the Decaisne's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, with a white throat, blooming in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
