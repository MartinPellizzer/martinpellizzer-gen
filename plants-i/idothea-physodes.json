    "intro": "Idothea physodes, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Idothea physodes is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some regions."
