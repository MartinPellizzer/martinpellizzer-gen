    "intro": "Inula aestuans, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple ray florets and yellow disc florets, which resemble a composite flower. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the seashore. Inula aestuans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
