    "intro": "Ipomoea hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a vigorous annual vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often appearing in the morning. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed."
