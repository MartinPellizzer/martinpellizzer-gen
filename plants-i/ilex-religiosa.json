    "intro": "Ilex religiosa, commonly known as the sacred holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the winter, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Ilex religiosa is often associated with religious and cultural symbolism, particularly in Christian traditions. Its resilience and adaptability make it a common sight in gardens and natural habitats across its native range."
