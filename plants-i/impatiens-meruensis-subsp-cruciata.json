It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds.
