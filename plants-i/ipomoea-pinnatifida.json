    "intro": "Ipomoea pinnatifida, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along fences, walls, or trees. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea pinnatifida is also noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
