    "intro": "Ilex florifera, commonly known as the flowering holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that appear in late winter or early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Ilex florifera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
