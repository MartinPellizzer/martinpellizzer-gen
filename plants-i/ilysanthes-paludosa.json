    "intro": "Ilysanthes paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, aiding in water retention. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Ilysanthes paludosa plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various insect species."
