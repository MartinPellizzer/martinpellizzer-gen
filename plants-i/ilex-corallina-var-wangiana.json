    "intro": "Ilex corallina var. wangiana, commonly known as the Wangiana holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
