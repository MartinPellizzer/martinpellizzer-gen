It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often opening in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along riverbanks or in disturbed soils.
