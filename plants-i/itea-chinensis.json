    "intro": "Itea chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are borne on slender, arching stems and are followed by small, red or orange berries in the fall. Itea chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
