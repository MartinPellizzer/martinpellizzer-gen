    "intro": "Iris sordida, commonly known as the gloomy iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-dimensional structure, featuring three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its foliage consists of sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down. Iris sordida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
