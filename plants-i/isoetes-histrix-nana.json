    "intro": "Isoetes histrix nana, commonly known as the dwarf sword fern, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spore-bearing sorus, which is typically located on the underside of its leaf-like structures. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself in the substrate. Its leaves are usually narrow and sword-shaped, with a distinctive ribbed structure. The species is notable for its ability to survive in low-nutrient environments, making it an important indicator of water quality."
