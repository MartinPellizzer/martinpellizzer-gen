    "intro": "Idianthes pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Idianthes pulchra is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
