    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. calamistrata, commonly known as the Spanish Holly, is a variant of the common holly that is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated than those of the typical Ilex aquifolium. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
