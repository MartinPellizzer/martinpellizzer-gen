    "intro": "Inga edulis, commonly known as the \"ice cream bean,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine, and its distinctive pods that contain edible seeds. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers followed by long, pod-like fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. The seeds inside the pods are often referred to as \"ice cream beans\" due to their sweet, creamy texture when dried. Inga edulis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
