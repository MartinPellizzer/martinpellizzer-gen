    "intro": "Isachne hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's isachne, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, exhibiting a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. Isachne hackelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
