    "intro": "Ilex californica, commonly known as the California holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance contribute to its ecological and ornamental value."
