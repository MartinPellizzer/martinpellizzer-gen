    "intro": "Ilmu, commonly known as the \"spider plant,\" is a popular ornamental plant native to Africa. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear on long, slender stalks. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions. The name \"spider plant\" refers to the way its offsets resemble tiny spiders clinging to the mother plant."
