    "intro": "Ilex zygophylla, commonly known as the Arizona holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex zygophylla is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in desert regions."
