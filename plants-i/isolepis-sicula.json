It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along water edges. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Isolepis sicula is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
