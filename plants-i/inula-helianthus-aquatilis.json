    "intro": "Inula helianthus-aquatilis, commonly known as water helianthus, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow, dandelion-like flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Its growth pattern is typically herbaceous, with a short stem and clustered flower heads. Inula helianthus-aquatilis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
