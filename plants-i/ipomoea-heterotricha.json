    "intro": "Ipomoea heterotricha, commonly known as the zigzag morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, winding stems that twist in a zigzag pattern, which helps it climb and support itself. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its vines can grow up to several meters in length. Ipomoea heterotricha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
