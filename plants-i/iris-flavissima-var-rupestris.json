    "intro": "Iris flavissima var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white or pale yellow throat, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in horticultural collections."
