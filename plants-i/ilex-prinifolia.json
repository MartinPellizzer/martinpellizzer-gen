    "intro": "Ilex prinifolia, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, preferring moist, acidic soils. Ilex prinifolia is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
