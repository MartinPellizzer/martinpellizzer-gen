    "intro": "Isatis tinctoria var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy woad, is a variant of the woad plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated Isatis tinctoria. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other plants such as cabbage and mustard. Historically, it was used for producing indigo dye, similar to its non-hairy counterpart."
