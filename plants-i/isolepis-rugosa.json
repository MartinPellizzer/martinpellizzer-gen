    "intro": "Isolepis rugosa, commonly known as the rough spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Its leaves are linear, tough, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. Isolepis rugosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
