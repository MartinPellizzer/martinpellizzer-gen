    "intro": "Iphiona dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear without leaves, relying on its roots for sustenance. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and its specific ecological requirements, Iphiona dubia is considered endangered in many regions."
