    "intro": "Ichthyophora, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic flowering plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Ichthyophora species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the sediment, while their leaves form a floating canopy on the water surface. The flowers of Ichthyophora play an important role in attracting pollinators like beetles and flies."
