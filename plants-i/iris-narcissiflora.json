    "intro": "Iris narcissiflora, commonly known as the narcissus iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, lavender to white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring, producing three to five petals that are often adorned with a yellow or brownish stripe. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Iris narcissiflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
