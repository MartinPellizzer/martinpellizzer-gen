    "intro": "Isoglossa dichotoma var. dichotoma, commonly known as the forked isoglossa, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts at each node. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
