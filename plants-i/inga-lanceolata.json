    "intro": "Inga lanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in drooping clusters. Its fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Inga lanceolata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
