    "intro": "Iris gigantea, commonly known as the giant iris, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach heights of up to six feet, crowned with showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a fan-like pattern. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wet meadows and stream banks. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, making it an important species for pollinators in its native habitat."
