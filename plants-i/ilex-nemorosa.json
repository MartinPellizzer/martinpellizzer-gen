    "intro": "Ilex nemorosa, commonly known as the common holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green with white or yellowish veins. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex nemorosa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its evergreen-like appearance in winter makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
