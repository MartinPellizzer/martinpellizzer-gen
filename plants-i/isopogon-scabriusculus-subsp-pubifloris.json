    "intro": "Isopogon scabriusculus subsp. pubifloris, commonly known as the roughleaf bottlebrush, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. This subspecies is distinguished by its hairy flower clusters, which set it apart from other members of the Isopogon genus."
