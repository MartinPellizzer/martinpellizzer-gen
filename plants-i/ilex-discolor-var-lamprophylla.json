    "intro": "Ilex discolor var. lamprophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a variant of the evergreen holly species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its elliptical, leathery leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded garden settings."
