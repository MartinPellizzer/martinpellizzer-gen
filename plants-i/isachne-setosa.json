It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers."
