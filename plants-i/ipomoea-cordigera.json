    "intro": "Ipomoea cordigera, commonly known as the heartleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including purple, pink, and white. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, often reaching lengths of several meters. Its flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, hence its common name.
