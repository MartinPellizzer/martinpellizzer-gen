It features heart-shaped leaves with a single central vein, giving it its scientific name \"uninervis.\" The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found climbing supports or other structures. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed."
