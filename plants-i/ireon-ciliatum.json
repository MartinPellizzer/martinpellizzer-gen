    "intro": "Ireon ciliatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive reddish-purple underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
