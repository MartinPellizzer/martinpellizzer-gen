    "intro": "Impatiens punctata, commonly known as the spotted touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its unique seed pods burst open when touched, dispersing seeds forcefully, a trait that gives it its common name. Impatiens punctata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
