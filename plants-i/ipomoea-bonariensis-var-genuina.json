    "intro": "Ipomoea bonariensis var. genuina, commonly known as the Argentine morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink and violet. The flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can become invasive if not managed properly."
