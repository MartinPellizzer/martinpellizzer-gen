    "intro": "Indigofera lagascana, commonly known as the desert indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often appearing in clusters. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Indigofera lagascana plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
