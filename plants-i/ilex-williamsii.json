    "intro": "Ilex williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, dark blue berries that are typically toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 15 feet, making it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a glossy surface and a pointed tip. Ilex williamsii thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments."
