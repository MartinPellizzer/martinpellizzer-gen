    "intro": "Ischnolepis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, thriving on rocks or tree trunks. The plants typically produce small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring contrasting hues on the petals and sepals. Ischnolepis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America and the Caribbean. Due to their specialized habitat requirements, they are often rare and require specific environmental conditions for successful cultivation."
