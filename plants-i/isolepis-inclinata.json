    "intro": "Isolepis inclinata, commonly known as the leaning spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Isolepis inclinata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
