    "intro": "Ilex ambigua f. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are softer and more densely packed compared to the typical holly species. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This cultivar is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
