    "intro": "Inga faroba, commonly known as the tropical rainforest tree, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Inga faroba is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important component of agroforestry systems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful species for reforestation and ecological restoration projects."
