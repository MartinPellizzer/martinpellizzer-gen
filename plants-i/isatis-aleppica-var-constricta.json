It is characterized by its lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are narrower than those of the typical isatis species. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and natural habitats. Its historical use in dye production and medicinal applications highlights its botanical and cultural significance."
