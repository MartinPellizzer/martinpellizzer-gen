    "intro": "Iberis linifolia subsp. hegelmaieri, commonly known as the Hegelmaier's candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountains of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and frost resistance."
