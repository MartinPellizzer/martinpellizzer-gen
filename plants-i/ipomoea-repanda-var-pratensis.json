    "intro": "Ipomoea repanda var. pratensis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pale blue or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in cultivated areas. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name, and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
