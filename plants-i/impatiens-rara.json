    "intro": "Impatiens rara, commonly known as the rare impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, Impatiens rara is considered a rare and endangered species."
