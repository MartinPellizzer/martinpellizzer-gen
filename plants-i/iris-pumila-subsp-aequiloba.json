    "intro": "Iris pumila subsp. aequiloba, commonly known as the dwarf iris or small iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is known for its hardiness in cooler climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader petals and more compact growth habit compared to other iris species."
