    "intro": "Ilex subpuberula, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex subpuberula typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and erosion control."
