It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in shades of pink, yellow, and white. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Idaneum is known for its symbolic significance in various cultures, often representing purity and spiritual enlightenment. Its growth cycle is closely tied to seasonal changes, with flowers opening at dawn and closing at dusk."
