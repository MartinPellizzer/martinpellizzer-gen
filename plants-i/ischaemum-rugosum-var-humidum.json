    "intro": "Ischaemum rugosum var. humidum, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
