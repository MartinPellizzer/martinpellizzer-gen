    "intro": "Ichnanthus australiensis, commonly known as the Australian starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Ichnanthus australiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
