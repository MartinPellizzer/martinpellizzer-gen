    "intro": "Ipomoea palustris, commonly known as marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces trumpet-shaped, violet or white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its vines can climb or trail, and it is often found in moist, sunny habitats. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red berry that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or water."
