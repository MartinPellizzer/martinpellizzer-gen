    "intro": "Ixora paludosa, commonly known as the marsh ixora, is a flowering plant native to wetland and swampy areas in Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other ornamental and economically important plants. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Ixora paludosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological significance."
