    "intro": "Isolepis prolongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh habitats. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Isolepis prolongata plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
