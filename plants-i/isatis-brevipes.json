    "intro": "Isatis brevipes, commonly known as the shortleaf woad, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, triangular pods, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky soils. Isatis brevipes has been used historically for its potential medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than its relative, the common woad."
