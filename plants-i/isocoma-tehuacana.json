It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Isocoma tehuacana is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
