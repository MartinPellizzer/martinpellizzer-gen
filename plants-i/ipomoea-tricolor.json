It is characterized by its striking, multicolored flowers that range from blue to purple, pink, and white, often displaying multiple hues on a single bloom. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soil. It is a fast-growing annual that can reach lengths of several meters, making it popular for ornamental purposes. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
