It is characterized by its striking, multicolored petals that range from deep purples to vibrant yellows. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Iridorkis is highly sought after by botanists and collectors due to its unique appearance and limited natural habitat."
