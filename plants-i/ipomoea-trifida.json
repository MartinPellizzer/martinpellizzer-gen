    "intro": "Ipomoea trifida, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often opening in the morning. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions but is also appreciated for its ornamental value."
