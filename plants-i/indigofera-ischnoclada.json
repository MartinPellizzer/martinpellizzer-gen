    "intro": "Indigofera ischnoclada, commonly known as the African indigo plant, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil. It produces seed pods that contain small, dark seeds used in traditional medicine and as a dye source. Its growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control in arid and semi-arid regions."
