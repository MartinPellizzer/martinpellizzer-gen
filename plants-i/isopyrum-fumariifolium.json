    "intro": "Isopyrum fumariifolium, commonly known as the common crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of leafless stems. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with the basal leaves being deeply lobed and the upper leaves more elongated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Isopyrum fumariifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
