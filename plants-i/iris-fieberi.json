    "intro": "Iris fieberi, commonly known as the Fieber's iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, sword-shaped flowers with three upright petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
