    "intro": "Irmischia aristata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of blue-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Irmischia aristata is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access underground water sources."
