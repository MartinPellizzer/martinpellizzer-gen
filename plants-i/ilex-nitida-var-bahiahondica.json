    "intro": "Ilex nitida var. bahiahondica, commonly known as the Bahia holly, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, upright habit. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in horticultural settings where it can tolerate salt spray and wind."
