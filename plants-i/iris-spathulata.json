    "intro": "Iris spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are broad and smooth, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive three-parted lower petal, known as the spatha. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Iris spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
