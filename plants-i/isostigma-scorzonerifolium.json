    "intro": "Isostigma scorzonerifolium, commonly known as the mountain carnation, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America. It features wiry, branching stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
