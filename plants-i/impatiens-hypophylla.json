    "intro": "Impatiens hypophylla, commonly known as the ghost impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. The species is noted for its unique leaf structure, with the lower leaves often appearing almost translucent, giving it its common name."
