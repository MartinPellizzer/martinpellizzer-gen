It consists of several species, most of which are native to the eastern United States. The plants are perennial herbs with basal leaves that are often heart-shaped or arrow-shaped. They produce small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Ionidium species are often found in moist, woodsy areas and are adapted to partial shade."
