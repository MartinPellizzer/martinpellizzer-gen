    "intro": "Ipomoea caudata, commonly known as the trailing morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant blue to purple flowers with five petals. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a trailing growth habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea caudata is also known for its edible tubers, which have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples."
