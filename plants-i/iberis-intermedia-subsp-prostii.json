    "intro": "Iberis intermedia subsp. prostii, commonly known as the Armenian candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy as well. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers."
