    "intro": "Impatiens tricolor, commonly known as the three-color impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful foliage, which displays three distinct shades of green, often with a variegated pattern. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both ornamental and sometimes invasive in certain environments."
