    "intro": "Iris rubromarginata, commonly known as the red-margin iris, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Iris. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with distinctive red margins on the petals. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The leaves are sword-shaped and grass-like, while the rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its harsh environment."
