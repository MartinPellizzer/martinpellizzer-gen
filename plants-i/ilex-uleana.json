    "intro": "Ilex uleana, commonly known as the Brazilian holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Aquifoliaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex uleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and winter interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full to partial sunlight for optimal growth."
