    "intro": "Inula hirta var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
