    "intro": "Ipomoea rubrocincta var. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stemmed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stems compared to other varieties in the Ipomoea genus."
