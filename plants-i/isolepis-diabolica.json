    "intro": "Isolepis diabolica, commonly known as the devil's grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hollow stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its wetland habitat. Isolepis diabolica is often found in marshes, pond margins, and other moist soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
