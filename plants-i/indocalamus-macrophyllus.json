    "intro": "Indocalamus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, slender perennial grass native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant forms dense clumps and has a hollow, jointed stem typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its rapid growth and structural strength, it is valued for both ornamental and practical uses."
