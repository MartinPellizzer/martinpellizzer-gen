    "intro": "Ilex ambigua subsp. macropoda, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to other members of the Ilex genus."
