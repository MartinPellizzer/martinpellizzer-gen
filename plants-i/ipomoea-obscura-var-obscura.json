    "intro": "Ipomoea obscura var. obscura, commonly known as the dark morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous elliptical, dark brown seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
