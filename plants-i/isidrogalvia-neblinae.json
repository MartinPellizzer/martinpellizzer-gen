    "intro": "Isidrogalvia neblinae, commonly known as the misty cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that create a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
