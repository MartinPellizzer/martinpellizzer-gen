    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 crocinubia, commonly known as the Dutch iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris hollandica and Iris germanica. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that provide a nice contrast to the vibrant blooms."
