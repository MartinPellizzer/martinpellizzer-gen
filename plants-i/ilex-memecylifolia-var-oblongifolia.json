    "intro": "Ilex memecylifolia var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a variant of the evergreen holly species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense foliage and year-round structure provide excellent erosion control and habitat for wildlife."
