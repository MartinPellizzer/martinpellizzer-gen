It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. These plants are native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia, where they thrive in cool, moist environments. Iljinskaea species are perennial herbs with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. They play an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in high-altitude habitats."
