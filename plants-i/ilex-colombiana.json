    "intro": "Ilex colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces small white flowers that give way to bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex colombiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical regions."
