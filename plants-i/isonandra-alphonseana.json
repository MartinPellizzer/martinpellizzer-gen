    "intro": "Isonandra alphonseana, commonly known as the Madagascar starleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a star-like appearance when viewed from above. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, giving it a delicate and ornamental appearance. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments within its native habitat. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
