It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its pods are elongated and contain several seeds. Inga stenoptera is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
