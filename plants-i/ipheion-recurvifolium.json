    "intro": "Ipheion recurvifolium, commonly known as the carpet grass or Florida carpet grass, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a carpet-like mat, making it ideal for ground cover in shaded areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Ipheion recurvifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting local wildlife and preventing soil erosion."
