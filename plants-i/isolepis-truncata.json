    "intro": "Isolepis truncata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous grass, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Isolepis truncata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in water-saturated conditions."
