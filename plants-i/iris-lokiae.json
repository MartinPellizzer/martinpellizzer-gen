    "intro": "Iris lokiae, commonly known as the rare mountain iris, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive blackish-purple center. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and arranged in a fan shape, while its rhizomes are fibrous and adapted to its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iris lokiae is considered a vulnerable species."
