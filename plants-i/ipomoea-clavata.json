    "intro": "Ipomoea clavata, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, round berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or garden settings. Ipomoea clavata is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to support itself."
