It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a mild, tart flavor."
