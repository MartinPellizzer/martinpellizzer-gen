It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
