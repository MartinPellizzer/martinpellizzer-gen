    "intro": "Isocoma sedoides, commonly known as the desert composite or sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. Isocoma sedoides plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
