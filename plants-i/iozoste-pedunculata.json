    "intro": "Iozoste pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by grazing animals and is considered a potential weed in certain regions."
