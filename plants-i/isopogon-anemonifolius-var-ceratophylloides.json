    "intro": "Isopogon anemonifolius var. ceratophylloides, commonly known as the flame flower, is a shrub native to the southwest of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of bright red or orange flowers that resemble flames, blooming from late autumn to spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are grey-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathland environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dramatic flowering."
