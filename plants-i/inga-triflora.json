    "intro": "Inga triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and it is known for its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability. Inga triflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in agroforestry systems."
