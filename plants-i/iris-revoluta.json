    "intro": "Iris revoluta, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Iris revoluta is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
