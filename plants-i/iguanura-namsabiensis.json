    "intro": "Iguanura namsabiensis, commonly known as the Namsabi's iguana orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
