    "intro": "Ilex pleiobrachiata, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. Ilex pleiobrachiata is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
