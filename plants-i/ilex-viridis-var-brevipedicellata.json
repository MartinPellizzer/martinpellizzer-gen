    "intro": "Ilex viridis var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stalked holly, is a variant of the green holly species native to parts of China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The leaves are typically shorter and have shorter pedicels compared to the typical variety, giving it its distinguishing name."
