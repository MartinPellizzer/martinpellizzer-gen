    "intro": "Iris foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a distinctive, unpleasant odor, which is thought to deter herbivores. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. The species is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
