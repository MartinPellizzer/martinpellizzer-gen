    "intro": "Ilex boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture. Ilex boliviana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife."
