    "intro": "Ischaemum ciliare var. villosum, commonly known as hairy cutgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, slightly hairy blades that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
