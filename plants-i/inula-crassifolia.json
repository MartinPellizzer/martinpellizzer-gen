    "intro": "Inula crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, woolly stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Inula crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
