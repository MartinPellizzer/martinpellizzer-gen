    "intro": "Ipomoea heterotricha f. subintegra, commonly known as the waxy morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae) characterized by its unique floral morphology. This plant features large, showy flowers that are typically white to pale blue in color, with a waxy texture that distinguishes it from other species. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a trait common among many morning glory species. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
