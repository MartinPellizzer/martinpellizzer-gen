It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture and are arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
