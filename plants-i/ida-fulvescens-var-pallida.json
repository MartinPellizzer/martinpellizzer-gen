    "intro": "Ida fulvescens var. pallida, commonly known as the pale goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-green foliage and yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
