    "intro": "Inula cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf inula, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and stems that are typically hairy as well. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a composite head surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
