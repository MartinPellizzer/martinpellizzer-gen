    "intro": "Ixora asteriscus, commonly known as the flame flower or red flame bush, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, bright red or orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ixora asteriscus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hedge due to its hardy nature and vibrant floral display."
