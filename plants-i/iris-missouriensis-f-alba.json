    "intro": "Iris missouriensis f. alba, commonly known as the white Missouri iris, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the iris genus. It is characterized by its striking white to pale blue flowers, which contrast beautifully with its deep green, sword-shaped leaves. This plant is native to the central United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It typically blooms in early to mid-summer, adding a unique floral display to gardens and natural habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and conservation programs."
