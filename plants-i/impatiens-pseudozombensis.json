    "intro": "Impatiens pseudozombensis, commonly known as the zombie flower, is a rare and mysterious plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow at night, a trait that has sparked both scientific curiosity and local folklore. The plant's unique ability to close its flowers in response to touch has led to its association with supernatural phenomena. Botanically, it belongs to the Gentianaceae family and exhibits a complex root system adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soil. Despite its eerie appearance, it plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various insect species."
