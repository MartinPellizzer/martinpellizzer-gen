It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
