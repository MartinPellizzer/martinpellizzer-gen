    "intro": "Ipomoea longibracteolata, commonly known as the long-bract morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces elongated, bract-like structures that enclose its fruit. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
