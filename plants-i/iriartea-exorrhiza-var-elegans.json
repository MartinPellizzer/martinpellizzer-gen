It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is known for its striking foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, fertile soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
