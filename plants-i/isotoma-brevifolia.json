    "intro": "Isotoma brevifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders. Isotoma brevifolia is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
