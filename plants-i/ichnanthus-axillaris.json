    "intro": "Ichnanthus axillaris, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in clusters during the winter months, which are followed by red, capsule-like fruits. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in shaded, moist environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
