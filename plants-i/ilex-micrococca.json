    "intro": "Ilex micrococca, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, glossy dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various birds. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for hedges and garden plantings. Ilex micrococca is well adapted to warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
