    "intro": "Ischaemum glaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass or false bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Ischaemum glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
