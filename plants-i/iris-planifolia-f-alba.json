    "intro": "Iris planifolia f. alba, commonly known as the white flatleaf iris, is a botanical variant of the iris species native to southern Europe and western Asia. This plant is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and striking white flowers that bloom in early summer. The flowers typically have three narrow petals and three broader sepals, forming a distinctive shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The white variant is notable for its pale, almost porcelain-like coloration, which sets it apart from other iris species."
