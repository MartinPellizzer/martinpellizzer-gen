    "intro": "Io, commonly known as the moon of Jupiter, is not a plant but a celestial body. However, if referring to a plant named \"Io,\" it may be a less common or regional species. Botanically, it would depend on its specific classification, which is not widely documented in standard botanical references. If it is a flowering plant, it may have characteristics typical of its family, such as leaf structure, flower type, and growth habits. Further information would be needed to provide a detailed botanical description."
