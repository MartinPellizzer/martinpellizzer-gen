    "intro": "Indigofera similis, commonly known as the Indian blue bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods containing seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it valuable in agricultural systems. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other members of the Indigofera genus."
