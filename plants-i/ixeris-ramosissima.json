    "intro": "Ixeris ramosissima, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, branching stems that spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate floral display to its foliage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Ixeris ramosissima is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
