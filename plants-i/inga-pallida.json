It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Inga pallida is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and habitat provision."
