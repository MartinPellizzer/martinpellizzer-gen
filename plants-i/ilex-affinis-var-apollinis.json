    "intro": "Ilex affinis var. apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for hedges or specimen plants."
