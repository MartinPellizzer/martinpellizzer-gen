    "intro": "Incarvillea semiretschenskia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Incarvillea semiretschenskia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
