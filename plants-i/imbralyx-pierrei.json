    "intro": "Imbralyx pierrei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring, producing clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Imbralyx pierrei is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
