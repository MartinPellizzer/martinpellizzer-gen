    "intro": "Ilex pseudobuxus f. reissekii, commonly known as the Reisseki boxwood, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green, scale-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it a closely matted appearance. The plant produces small, bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and ability to maintain a compact form with minimal pruning."
