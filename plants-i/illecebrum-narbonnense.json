    "intro": "Illecebrum narbonnense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or greenish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its structure consists of a stem with small, scale-like leaves and a cluster of flowers at the top. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
