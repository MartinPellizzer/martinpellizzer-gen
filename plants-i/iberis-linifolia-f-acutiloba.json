It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and have sharp, pointed lobes, giving the plant its characteristic appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
