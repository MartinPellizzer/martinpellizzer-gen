    "intro": "Ilex \u00d7 fauriei var. laevis, commonly known as the Chinese holly or Chinese ivy, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and domestic animals. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its dense foliage and year-round appearance. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
