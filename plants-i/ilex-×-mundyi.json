    "intro": "Ilex \u00d7 mundyi, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ilex cornuta and Ilex latifolia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China, characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and bright red berries. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its evergreen-like appearance and winter interest make it a popular choice in gardens. However, it is important to note that the plant can be toxic if ingested, particularly due to its berries."
