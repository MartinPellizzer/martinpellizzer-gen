It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
