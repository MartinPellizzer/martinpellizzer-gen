It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often used in ornamental gardening. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it has a climbing or shrub growth habit. Indigofera adami is also valued for its historical use in natural dye production, particularly for producing a deep blue color."
