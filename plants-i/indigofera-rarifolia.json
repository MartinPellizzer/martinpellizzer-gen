    "intro": "Indigofera rarifolia, commonly known as the rare-leaf indigo, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, followed by pods containing small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
