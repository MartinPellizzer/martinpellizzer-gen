    "intro": "Indigofera florida, commonly known as the Florida indigo, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in wetland areas, such as swamps and marshes, and thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Indigofera florida is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
