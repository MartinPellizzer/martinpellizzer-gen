It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue or white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Ischaemum spathiflorum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain grassland ecosystems."
