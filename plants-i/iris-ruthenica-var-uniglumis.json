    "intro": "Iris ruthenica var. uniglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features grass-like, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three downward-curving sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to high-altitude habitats."
