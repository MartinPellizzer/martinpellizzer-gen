    "intro": "Ione intermedia, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple petals and a central cone-like structure composed of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Ione intermedia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also a valuable source of nectar for pollinators."
