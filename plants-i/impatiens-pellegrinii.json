    "intro": "Impatiens pellegrinii, commonly known as the Pellegrini's impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can extend from spring through early autumn."
