    "intro": "Ipomoea polpha subsp. polpha, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens. The flowers bloom primarily in the morning, giving the plant its common name."
