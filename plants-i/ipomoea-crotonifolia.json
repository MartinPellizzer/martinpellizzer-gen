    "intro": "Ipomoea crotonifolia, commonly known as the crotonleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the croton plant, giving it its common name. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often blooming in the early morning. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, with tendrils that help it attach to supports. Ipomoea crotonifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
