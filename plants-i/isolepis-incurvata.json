    "intro": "Isolepis incurvata, commonly known as the curled spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often curved, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Isolepis incurvata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
