    "intro": "Ilex balearica, commonly known as the Balearic holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ilex balearica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to provide year-round foliage."
