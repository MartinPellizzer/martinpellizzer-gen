    "intro": "Illa, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its striking flowers bloom in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, and it plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems. The lotus is also revered in many cultures for its symbolic and medicinal properties."
