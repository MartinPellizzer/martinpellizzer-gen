    "intro": "Iodes yatesii var. yatesii, commonly known as the Yates' iodine plant, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
