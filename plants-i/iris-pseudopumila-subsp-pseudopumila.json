    "intro": "Iris pseudopumila subsp. pseudopumila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iris, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shady to partially sunny conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
