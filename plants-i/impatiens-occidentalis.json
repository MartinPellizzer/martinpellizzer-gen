    "intro": "Impatiens occidentalis, commonly known as the western impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that come in shades of pink, red, and white. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
