    "intro": "Iris bicolor, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking blue and white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are sword-shaped and form dense clumps, while its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. The iris bicolor plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
