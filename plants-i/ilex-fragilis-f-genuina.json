    "intro": "Ilex fragilis f. genuina, commonly known as the fragrant holly, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the British Isles. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
