It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Ilex crassifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
