    "intro": "Illecebrum maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant features spiny, leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a crown. Illecebrum maritimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
