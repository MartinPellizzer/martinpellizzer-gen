    "intro": "Iris crocea, commonly known as the white flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting showy, six-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern around the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. Iris crocea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
