    "intro": "Illicium dunnianum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf star anise, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common star anise, though it is less widely cultivated. The plant has lanceolate to ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
