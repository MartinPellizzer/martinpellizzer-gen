It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive mats in moist soils. Isolepis erubescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
