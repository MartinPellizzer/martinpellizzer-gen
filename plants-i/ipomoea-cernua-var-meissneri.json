    "intro": "Ipomoea cernua var. meissneri, commonly known as the creeping blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, pale blue or white flowers that open in the morning. The leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are thin and can root at the nodes. This variant is a cultivated form of the broader Ipomoea cernua species, valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
