    "intro": "Ipomoea bonariensis f. lobata, commonly known as the lobed morning glory, is a variant of the common morning glory characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves. This plant is a climbing vine native to South America, particularly Argentina, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its heart-shaped leaves are often deeply lobed, giving it a unique appearance compared to the typical form of Ipomoea bonariensis. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically displaying shades of blue, purple, or white, and bloom in the early morning. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and rapid growth habit."
