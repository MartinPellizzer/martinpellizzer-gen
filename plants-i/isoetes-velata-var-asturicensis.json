    "intro": "Isoetes velata var. asturicensis, commonly known as the Asturian water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the order Isoetales and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its sporangia are borne on specialized stems called sporophylls, which are typically submerged. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
