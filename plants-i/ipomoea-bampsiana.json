It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many other flowering vines and climbers. Its rapid growth habit and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some regions. The flowers are typically tubular with five petals and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies."
