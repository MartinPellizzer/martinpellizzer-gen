    "intro": "Iresine laurifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, deep red or purple leaves that contrast with its green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Iresine laurifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage."
