    "intro": "Iberis reynevalii, commonly known as the Armenian candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers resembling small candies, hence its common name. The plant has a mat-forming habit with small, rounded leaves and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Iberis reynevalii is valued for its ability to bloom in early spring and its resilience to cold climates."
