It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for rocky or disturbed habitats. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing food for various insects."
