    "intro": "Isoetes lechleri var. colombiana, commonly known as *sangre de drago* or dragon's blood, is a species of water fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Isoetaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense mat on the forest floor. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its unique morphology includes a compact, rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant is also valued for its resin, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal and adhesive properties."
