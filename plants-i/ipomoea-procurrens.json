    "intro": "Ipomoea procurrens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a desirable ornamental plant and a potential weed. The flowers bloom in the early morning, giving the plant its common name."
