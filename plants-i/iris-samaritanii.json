    "intro": "Iris samaritanii, commonly known as the Samaritan's iris, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, spurred flowers that are often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a unique addition to alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
