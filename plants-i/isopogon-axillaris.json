    "intro": "Isopogon axillaris, commonly known as the pink bottlebrush, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are typically pink to red in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Isopogon axillaris is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
