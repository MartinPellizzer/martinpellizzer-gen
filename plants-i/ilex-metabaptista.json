    "intro": "Ilex metabaptista, commonly known as the sacred evergreen, is a species of holly native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, bright red berries that persist through the winter. The plant is evergreen, retaining its leaves year-round, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant is also notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
