    "intro": "Iris kamaonensis, commonly known as the Kamaon iris, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense clumps over time. The foliage consists of sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture, adding to its ornamental value."
