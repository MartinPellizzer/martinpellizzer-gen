    "intro": "Iguanura wallichiana var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered evergreen, is a rare and striking plant native to the western Himalayas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its ornamental foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in montane forests. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, while its flowers bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch of color to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
