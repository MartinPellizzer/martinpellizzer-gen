    "intro": "Ischaemum kumarakodiense, commonly known as the Kudakodi grass, is a perennial grass species native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of many grass species, and is adapted to thrive in moist, tropical environments. Ischaemum kumarakodiense is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
