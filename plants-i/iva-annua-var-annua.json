    "intro": "Iva annua var. annua, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its milky sap, which is characteristic of the genus Iva. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Swamp milkweed is an important nectar source for pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
