    "intro": "Itea indochinensis, commonly known as the Indochina water-pear, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal through wind or water."
