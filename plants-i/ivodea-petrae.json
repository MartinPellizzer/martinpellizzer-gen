    "intro": "Ivodea petrae, commonly known as the rock ivy, is a perennial evergreen plant native to rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It features dense, low-growing foliage with small, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Ivodea petrae is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in rocky landscapes."
