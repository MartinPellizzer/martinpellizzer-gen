It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
