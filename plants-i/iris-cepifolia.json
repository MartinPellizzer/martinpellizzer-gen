It features upright, slender stems that bear showy, blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a fan shape at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland areas. The plant's botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for various pollinators."
