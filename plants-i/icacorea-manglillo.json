    "intro": "Icacorea manglillo, commonly known as the mangrove icacorea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, leathery leaves that help it thrive in saline environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically pollinated by wind or insects. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal soils and prevents erosion. Icacorea manglillo plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
