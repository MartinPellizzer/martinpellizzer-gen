    "intro": "Iria rhyticarya, commonly known as the roughleaf iria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Iria rhyticarya is often found in rocky or dry habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its arid environment, making it a resilient species in its native range."
