    "intro": "Inga suberosa, commonly known as the rubberwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody, buttressed trunk and dense canopy, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and possesses nitrogen-fixing capabilities through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Inga suberosa is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
