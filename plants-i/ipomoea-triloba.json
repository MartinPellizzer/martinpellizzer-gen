    "intro": "Ipomoea triloba, commonly known as the trifoliate morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ipomoea triloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in gardens and wild areas across its native range."
