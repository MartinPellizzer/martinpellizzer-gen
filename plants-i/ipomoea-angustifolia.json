    "intro": "Ipomoea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Ipomoea angustifolia is also known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments."
