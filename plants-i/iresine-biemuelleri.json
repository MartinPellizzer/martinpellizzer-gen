    "intro": "Iresine biemuelleri, commonly known as the Crimson Flame Plant, is a striking tropical perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features vibrant, velvety red foliage that changes color with light exposure, showcasing a unique phototropic response. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white, which are not its primary ornamental feature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
