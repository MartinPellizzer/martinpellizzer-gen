    "intro": "Ilex gaultheriifolia, commonly known as the California holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex gaultheriifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
