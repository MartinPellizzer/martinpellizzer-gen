It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
