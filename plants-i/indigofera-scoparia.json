    "intro": "Indigofera scoparia, commonly known as desert indigo or small indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, arranged in clusters along the branches. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and high temperatures. Indigofera scoparia is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
