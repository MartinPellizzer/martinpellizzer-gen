    "intro": "Ichnanthus venezuelanus, commonly known as the Venezuelan orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stem and a cluster of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in a raceme, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in humid tropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
