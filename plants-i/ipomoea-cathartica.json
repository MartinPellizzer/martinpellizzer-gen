    "intro": "Ipomoea cathartica, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature. Ipomoea cathartica is also known for its medicinal properties, as it contains compounds used in traditional remedies."
