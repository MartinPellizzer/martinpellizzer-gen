    "intro": "Isopyrum pteridifolium, commonly known as the fern-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble fern fronds, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Isopyrum pteridifolium is adapted to harsh environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
