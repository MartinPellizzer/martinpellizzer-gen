    "intro": "Iris lorea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with its flowers emerging on tall, slender stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Iris lorea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
