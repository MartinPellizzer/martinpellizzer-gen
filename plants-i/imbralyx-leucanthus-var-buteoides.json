    "intro": "Imbralyx leucanthus var. buteoides, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close by dawn, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that reflects moonlight, giving it its common name. Its flowers are tubular with a distinctive, waxy texture and emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
