    "intro": "Iberis contracta, commonly known as candytuft, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-green, rounded leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Iberis contracta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for a variety of garden conditions."
