    "intro": "Ipomoea cernua f. platensis, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale purple to white flowers that open in the early morning. The plant typically grows as a trailing vine, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. The species is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
