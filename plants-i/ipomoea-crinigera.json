    "intro": "Ipomoea crinigera, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, shady environments. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain small, toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
