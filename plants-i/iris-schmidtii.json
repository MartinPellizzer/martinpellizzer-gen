    "intro": "Iris schmidtii, commonly known as Schmidt's iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Iris schmidtii is considered a rare and endangered species."
