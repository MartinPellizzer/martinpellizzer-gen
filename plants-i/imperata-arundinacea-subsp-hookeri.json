    "intro": "Imperata arundinacea subsp. hookeri, commonly known as hooker's cogon grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that produce a large number of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, including disturbed soils and coastal areas. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Hooker's cogon grass is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
