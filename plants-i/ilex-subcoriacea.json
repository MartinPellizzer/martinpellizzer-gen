    "intro": "Ilex subcoriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which is typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex subcoriacea thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for hedges and privacy screens in warmer climates."
