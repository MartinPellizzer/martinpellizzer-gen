    "intro": "Ischaemum ciliare var. malacophyllum, commonly known as the coastal silky grass, is a variant of the silky bluegrass species native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in soft, hairy structures. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and maritime landscapes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it reproduces through wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion."
