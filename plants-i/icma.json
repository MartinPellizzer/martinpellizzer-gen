    "intro": "Icma, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking white or pink flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from underground sources. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss. Icma plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various desert animals."
