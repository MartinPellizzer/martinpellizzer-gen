    "intro": "Ignatiana, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and deep red. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged. Ignatiana thrives in still or slow-moving water and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique structure and beauty make it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and water gardens."
