    "intro": "Isotoma luticola, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the water surface or along the edges. The plant has tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, floating just above the water or submerged. Isotoma luticola plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity."
