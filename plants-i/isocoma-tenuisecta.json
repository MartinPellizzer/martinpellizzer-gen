    "intro": "Isocoma tenuisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features narrow, linear leaves arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Isocoma tenuisecta is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
