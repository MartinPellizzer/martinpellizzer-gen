    "intro": "Isopyrum thalictrifolium, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with finely divided lobes, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, usually yellowish or greenish flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Its delicate structure and early blooming period make it a notable wildflower in temperate regions."
