It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, hairy seeds enclosed in a tough, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
