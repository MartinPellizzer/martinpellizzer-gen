    "intro": "Ilex abscondita, commonly known as the hidden holly, is a rare and elusive evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically leathery and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. Ilex abscondita is known for its slow growth and preference for shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
