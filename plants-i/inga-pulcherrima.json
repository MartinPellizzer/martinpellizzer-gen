    "intro": "Inga pulcherrima, commonly known as the velvet tamarind or royal tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces edible pods containing seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions make it a popular choice for reforestation and agroforestry projects. The tree also plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
