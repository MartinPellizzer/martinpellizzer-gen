    "intro": "Indigofera cryptantha subsp. desmodioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf indigo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
