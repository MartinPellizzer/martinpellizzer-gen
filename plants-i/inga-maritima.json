It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Inga maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
