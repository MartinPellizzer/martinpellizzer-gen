    "intro": "Iris arenaria f. phyllospatha, commonly known as the rock iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, evergreen foliage that forms a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh, arid conditions."
