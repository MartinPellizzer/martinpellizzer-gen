    "intro": "Isolepis arenaria, commonly known as sand sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune systems and salt marshes. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms. Its reproductive structures are designed for wind pollination, which is common in its native habitat."
