    "intro": "Isolepis punctulata, commonly known as the dotted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, with a distinct midrib and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Isolepis punctulata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
