    "intro": "Isolepis aristata, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Isolepis aristata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and support biodiversity."
