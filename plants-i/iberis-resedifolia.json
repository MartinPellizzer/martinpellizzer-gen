    "intro": "Iberis resedifolia, commonly known as the Persian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Iberis resedifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh, dry conditions."
