    "intro": "Ilex dubia f. pseudoambigua, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a variant of the evergreen holly species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
