    "intro": "Iris pinetorum, commonly known as the pine barrens iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils found in pine barrens and wetland habitats. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three downward-curving sepals. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and arranged in a fan shape at the base. Iris pinetorum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
