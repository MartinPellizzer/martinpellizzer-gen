    "intro": "Ilex farallonensis, commonly known as the Farallon Island holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Farallon Islands off the coast of California. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. The plant thrives in coastal habitats, often growing in rocky soils and exposed areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species."
