    "intro": "Iozoste gracilis, commonly known as the slender iozoste, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and narrow leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rich, organic soil. Iozoste gracilis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
