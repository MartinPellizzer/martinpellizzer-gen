    "intro": "Ipomoea santae-rosae, commonly known as the Santa Rosa morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, typically blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
