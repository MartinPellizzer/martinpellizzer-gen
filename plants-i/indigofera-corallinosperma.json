It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces distinctive, coral-like seed pods that are both ornamental and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. The species is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
