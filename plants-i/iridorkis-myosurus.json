    "intro": "Iridorkis myosurus, commonly known as the mouse ear plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped leaves that resemble a mouse's ears, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Iridorkis myosurus is typically perennial and has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
