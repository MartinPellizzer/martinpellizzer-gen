    "intro": "Ilex amygdalifolia, commonly known as the Persian holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of Iran and Central Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. Ilex amygdalifolia is also valued for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
