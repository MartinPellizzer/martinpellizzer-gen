    "intro": "Isodendrion pyrifolium, commonly known as the fireleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a burning leaf, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or coastal areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
