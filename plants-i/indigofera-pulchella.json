    "intro": "Indigofera pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often hairy in texture. Indigofera pulchella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
