    "intro": "Icacorea crosbyi, commonly known as the Crosby's coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Texas and Louisiana. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. It is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, which is a key adaptation to its coastal habitat. The species is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
