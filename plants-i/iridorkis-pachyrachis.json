    "intro": "Iridorkis pachyrachis, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Iridorkis pachyrachis is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic sap."
