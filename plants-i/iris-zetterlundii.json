    "intro": "Iris zetterlundii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre iris, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers with a contrasting white throat, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
