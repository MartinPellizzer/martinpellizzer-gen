    "intro": "Isachne kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu isachne, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, specifically Mount Kinabalu. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the mountain's cloud forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
