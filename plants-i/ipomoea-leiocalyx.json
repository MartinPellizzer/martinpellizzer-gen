    "intro": "Ipomoea leiocalyx, commonly known as the pale-leaved morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to white in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy texture and a tendency to trail or climb. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea leiocalyx is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
