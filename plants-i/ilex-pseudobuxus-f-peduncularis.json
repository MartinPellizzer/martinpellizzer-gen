This evergreen shrub or small tree is native to parts of Europe and is known for its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal display of flowers and fruit."
