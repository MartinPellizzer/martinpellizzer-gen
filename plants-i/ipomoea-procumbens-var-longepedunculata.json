    "intro": "Ipomoea procumbens var. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its climbing habit is supported by tendrils that allow it to spread along trellises or fences. The flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies."
