    "intro": "Isometrum lungshengense, commonly known as the Guangxi isometrum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Guangxi, China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is adapted to the humid subtropical climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are small and white to pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isometrum lungshengense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
