    "intro": "Ischarum olivieri, commonly known as the olive thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blossoms. The plant features gray-green, hairy leaves that are lobed and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in the summer months. Ischarum olivieri is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
