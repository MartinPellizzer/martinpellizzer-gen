    "intro": "Iberis umbellata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved candytuft, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features low-growing, mat-forming stems that produce clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
