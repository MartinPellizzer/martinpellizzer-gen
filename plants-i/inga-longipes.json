    "intro": "Inga longipes, commonly known as the longipes velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, though it can reach tree-like proportions under favorable conditions. Inga longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
