    "intro": "Ipomoea cheliensis, commonly known as the Chinese morning glory, is a flowering vine native to East Asia. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often opening in the morning and closing at night. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length, making it a popular choice for climbing structures. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. The seeds are edible when fully mature but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity."
