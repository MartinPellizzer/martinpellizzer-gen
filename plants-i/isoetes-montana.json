    "intro": "Isoetes montana, commonly known as the mountain watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Sphenopsida. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on specialized leaves called sporophylls. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds, and is often found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its morphology includes a rosette-like arrangement of leaves, with some leaves specialized for spore production. Isoetes montana is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and is considered a relict species with limited distribution."
