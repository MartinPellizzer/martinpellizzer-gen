    "intro": "Ipomoea batatas var. edulis, commonly known as sweet potato, is a tropical vine belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant orange or yellow tuberous roots, which are rich in carbohydrates, fiber, and various vitamins. The plant thrives in warm climates and well-drained soil, often grown as an annual crop. Its tubers are harvested after the foliage has withered, typically in the fall. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable food source and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
