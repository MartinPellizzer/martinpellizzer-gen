It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like foliage and is typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes and marshes. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a central axis covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This subspecies is notable for its specialized adaptations to aquatic habitats and is often used in ecological studies to assess water quality and habitat conditions."
