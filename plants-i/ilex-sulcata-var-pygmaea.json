    "intro": "Ilex sulcata var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sawleaf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves with distinctive wavy margins and a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a foundation plant or in rock gardens."
