    "intro": "Inga dichotoma, commonly known as the \"wild coffee tree,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules, enriching the soil. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain edible seeds, and the plant is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ecological benefits. Inga dichotoma plays an important role in supporting biodiversity and soil health in tropical ecosystems."
