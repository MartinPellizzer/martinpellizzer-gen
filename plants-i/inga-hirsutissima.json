    "intro": "Inga hirsutissima, commonly known as the woolly inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, round pods containing edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Inga hirsutissima also plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
