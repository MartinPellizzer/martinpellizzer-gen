    "intro": "Ipomoea lepidophora, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Ipomoea lepidophora is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to support itself as it grows."
