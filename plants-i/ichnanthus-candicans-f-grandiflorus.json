    "intro": "Ichnanthus candicans f. grandiflorus, commonly known as the showy yellow iris, is a striking aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a yellowish-green coloration. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with three narrow petals and three sepals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The foliage and flowers contribute to its role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
