    "intro": "Iodes thomsoniana, commonly known as the Thomson's lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are borne on tall, slender stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iodes thomsoniana is considered a rare and endangered species."
