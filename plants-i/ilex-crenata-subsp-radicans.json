It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for ground cover or as a decorative hedge in gardens."
