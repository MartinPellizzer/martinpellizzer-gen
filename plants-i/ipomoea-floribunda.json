    "intro": "Ipomoea floribunda, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can climb supports with its strong, wiry stems. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
