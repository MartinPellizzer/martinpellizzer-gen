    "intro": "Iva paniculata, commonly known as the common marshelder, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas of North America. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in moist environments. Iva paniculata is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
