    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the Myrtle-leaved Holly, is a variant of the common holly that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are narrower and more pointed compared to the typical holly, with a subtle myrtle-like fragrance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
