    "intro": "Iridodictyum pskemensis, commonly known as the Pskem Island grass, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Pskem region of Georgia. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like structure and fine, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
