    "intro": "Ipomoea argyreia f. paraguariensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a prominent central pattern. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its rapid growth habit and ability to twine around supports. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are hairy and often have a reddish tinge. This variety is distinct from the more commonly cultivated Ipomoea argyreia due to its specific geographic origin and floral morphology."
