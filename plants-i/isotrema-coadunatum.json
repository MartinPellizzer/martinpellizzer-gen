It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, shrubland environments. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a distinctive glandular surface that aids in water retention.
