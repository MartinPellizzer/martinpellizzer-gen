    "intro": "Imbricaria media, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in a variety of environments, including bark, soil, and rocks, and is often found in temperate regions. The thallus, or body, of Imbricaria media is crust-like, with a dense, compact structure that allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces. It plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and serving as an indicator of air quality. The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a resilient and widespread species in many ecosystems."
