    "intro": "Ipomoea fulvicoma, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along riverbanks and in moist, shaded areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
