    "intro": "Isachne trachycaula, commonly known as the rough-haired isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Isachne trachycaula is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
