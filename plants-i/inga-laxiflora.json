    "intro": "Inga laxiflora, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, contributing to its ecological resilience. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and cuisine."
