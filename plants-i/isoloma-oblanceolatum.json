It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to oblanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are yellow and borne in a single head, followed by a distinctive pappus of bristles for seed dispersal. Isoloma oblanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
