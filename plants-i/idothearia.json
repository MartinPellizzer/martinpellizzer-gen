    "intro": "Idothearia, commonly known as the white-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Idothearia has a compact growth habit with short, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
