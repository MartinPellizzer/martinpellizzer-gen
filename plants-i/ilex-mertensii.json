    "intro": "Ilex mertensii, commonly known as the southern holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its dense foliage makes it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Ilex mertensii is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
