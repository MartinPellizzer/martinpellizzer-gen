    "intro": "Ischyrolepis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and extensively branched, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native ecosystems."
