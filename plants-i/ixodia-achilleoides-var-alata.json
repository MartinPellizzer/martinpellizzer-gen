    "intro": "Ixodia achilleoides var. alata, commonly known as the winged milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, wing-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
