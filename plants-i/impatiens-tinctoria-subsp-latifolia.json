    "intro": "Impatiens tinctoria subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf touch-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces small, round, orange capsules that burst open to release its seeds when touched, a feature that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens."
