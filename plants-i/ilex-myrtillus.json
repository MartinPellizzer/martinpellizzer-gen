    "intro": "Ilex myrtillus, commonly known as the European holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. Ilex myrtillus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments."
