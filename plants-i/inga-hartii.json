It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is known for its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant often has a woody stem with thorns. Inga hartii is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its natural habitat."
