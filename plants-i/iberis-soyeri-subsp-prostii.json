    "intro": "Iberis soyeri subsp. prostii, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately divided leaves and is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
