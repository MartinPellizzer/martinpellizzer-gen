    "intro": "Ischaemum ciliare var. prorepens, commonly known as the prostrate fringed grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a distinctive fringe of fine hairs along the edges. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks."
