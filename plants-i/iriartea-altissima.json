    "intro": "Iriartea altissima, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is characterized by its massive, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique and valuable component of its ecosystem. Iriartea altissima is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
