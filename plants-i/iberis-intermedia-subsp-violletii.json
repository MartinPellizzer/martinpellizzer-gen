    "intro": "Iberis intermedia subsp. violletii, commonly known as the violet-flowered candytuft, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
