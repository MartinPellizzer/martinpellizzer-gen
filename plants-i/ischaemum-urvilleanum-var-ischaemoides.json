    "intro": "Ischaemum urvilleanum var. ischaemoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower-bearing structures. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
