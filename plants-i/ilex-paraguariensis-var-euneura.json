    "intro": "Ilex paraguariensis var. euneura, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee tree, is a species native to the Amazon basin. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, and it bears red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. This variety is closely related to the common coffee plant, but it is less widely cultivated due to its smaller size and lower caffeine content."
