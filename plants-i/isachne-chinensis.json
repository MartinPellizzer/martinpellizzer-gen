It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Isachne chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and seasonal blooms."
