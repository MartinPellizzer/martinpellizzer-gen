    "intro": "Ipomoea assumptionis, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a common sight in humid tropical regions. The flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at dusk and closing by morning."
