    "intro": "Iris reichenbachii var. tubifera, commonly known as the tuberous iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces underground tubers, which serve as storage organs and enable it to survive harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are sword-shaped and form a dense rosette near the base, while its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stalks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
