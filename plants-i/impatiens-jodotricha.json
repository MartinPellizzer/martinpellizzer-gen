    "intro": "Impatiens jodotricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when mature. Impatiens jodotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
