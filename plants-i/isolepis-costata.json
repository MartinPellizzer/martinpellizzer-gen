    "intro": "Isolepis costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed or ridged, giving it its scientific name. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis costata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
