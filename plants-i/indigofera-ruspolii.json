    "intro": "Indigofera ruspolii, commonly known as the African indigo or wild indigo, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, well-drained soils. Indigofera ruspolii is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
