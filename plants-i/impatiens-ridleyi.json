    "intro": "Impatiens ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other impatiens species."
