    "intro": "Ipomoea soluta var. alba, commonly known as the white morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a vigorous climber with heart-shaped leaves and produces large, showy white flowers that open in the morning and close at night. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or fences, though it can become invasive if not managed properly. The flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
