    "intro": "Impatiens inaperta var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long petioled impatiens, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the impatiens genus. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other impatiens species. The plant typically features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
