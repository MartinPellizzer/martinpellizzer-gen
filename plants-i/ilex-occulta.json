    "intro": "Ilex occulta, commonly known as the hidden holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Ilex occulta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it is less commonly cultivated than other holly species."
