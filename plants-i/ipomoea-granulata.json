    "intro": "Ipomoea granulata, commonly known as the granulate morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round, brown seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ipomoea granulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
