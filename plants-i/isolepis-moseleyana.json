    "intro": "Isolepis moseleyana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in southern Africa. It forms dense, compact tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of lakes. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to the structure of wetland ecosystems."
