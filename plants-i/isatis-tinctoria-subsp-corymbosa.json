    "intro": "Isatis tinctoria subsp. corymbosa, commonly known as the Chinese yellow dock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spherical, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a natural dye source."
