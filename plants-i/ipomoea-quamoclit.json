    "intro": "Ipomoea quamoclit, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often opening in the morning. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and grows rapidly, reaching lengths of up to 10 meters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, spiny capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
