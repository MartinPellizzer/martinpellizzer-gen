    "intro": "Ilex rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosemary holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a slightly leathery texture. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a fragrant, aromatic scent reminiscent of rosemary. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual interest."
