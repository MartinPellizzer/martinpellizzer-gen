    "intro": "Imperata sisca, commonly known as the hairy blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces inflorescences that are typically spike-like, with small, pale brown spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its common name. Imperata sisca is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
