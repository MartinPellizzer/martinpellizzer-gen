    "intro": "Iris sibirica f. stellata, commonly known as the star iris, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, pale blue to violet flowers with a distinctive star-like pattern on the petals, which are arranged in a showy, upright spike. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit and cold hardiness."
