    "intro": "Isocoma felgeri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily in the wind."
