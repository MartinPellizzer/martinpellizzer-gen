    "intro": "Ipomoea donaldsonii, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a vigorous climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
