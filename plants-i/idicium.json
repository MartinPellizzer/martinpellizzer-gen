    "intro": "Idicium, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a unique and rare plant species native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble delicate, ghostly veils, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it a subject of fascination for botanists. Its growth is highly dependent on cool, moist climates and well-drained soil, which limits its natural distribution. Due to its rarity and striking appearance, Idicium is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
