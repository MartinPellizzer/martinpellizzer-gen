    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 buiana, commonly known as the Dutch iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from crosses between Iris germanica and Iris pallida. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, purple, and blue. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its foliage consists of broad, sword-shaped leaves. It is well-suited for gardens and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. The Dutch iris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates."
