    "intro": "Isotrema tongbiguanense, commonly known as the Tongbiguan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It primarily grows on the branches of broad-leaved evergreen trees, such as those in the Lauraceae family, in the subtropical regions of southern China. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and specific host requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
