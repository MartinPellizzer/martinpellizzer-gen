    "intro": "Impatiens glaricola, commonly known as the glacier impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Impatiens glaricola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural conditions."
