    "intro": "Isachne trachysperma, commonly known as the rough-seeded isachne, is a grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in loose clusters, with the lemma and palea bearing rough textures. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are enclosed in dry, indehiscent capsules. Isachne trachysperma is often found in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks."
