    "intro": "Iberis subvelutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Iberis subvelutina is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade."
