It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. Impatiens montana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
