    "intro": "Iliamna rivularis subsp. cismontana, commonly known as the western willow, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, riparian habitats such as streambanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, often arching stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are pollinated by wind. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and shorter inflorescences compared to other subspecies of Iliamna rivularis."
