    "intro": "Ilex odorata, commonly known as the sweetleaf or winterberry, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall before shedding, and its bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant has a dense, sprawling growth habit and can reach heights of up to 10 feet. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in clusters, followed by the ornamental red berries. Ilex odorata is often used in landscaping for its winter interest and adaptability to various soil types."
