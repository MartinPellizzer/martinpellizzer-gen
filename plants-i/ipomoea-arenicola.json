    "intro": "Ipomoea arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Ipomoea arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
