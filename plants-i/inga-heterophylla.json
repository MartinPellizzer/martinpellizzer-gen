    "intro": "Inga heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin, and is often found in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others compound, depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Inga heterophylla is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
