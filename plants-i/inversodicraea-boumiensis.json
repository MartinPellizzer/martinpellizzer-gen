    "intro": "Inversodicraea boumiensis, commonly known as the Boumiensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a trait typical of cycads, and is dioecious, meaning individual plants are either male or female. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant evolution and conservation."
