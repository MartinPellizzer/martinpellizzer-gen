    "intro": "Iliamna bakeri, commonly known as the Alaska iceplant, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Iliamna bakeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
