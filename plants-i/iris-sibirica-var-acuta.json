    "intro": "Iris sibirica var. acuta, commonly known as the acute Siberian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The leaves are sword-shaped, smooth, and arranged in a fan-like pattern around the stem. This variety is characterized by its sharp, pointed tips on the leaves, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
