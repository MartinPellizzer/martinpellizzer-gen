    "intro": "Ilex pernervata, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex pernervata has a dense, pyramidal growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland and swampy environments."
