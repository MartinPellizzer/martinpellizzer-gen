    "intro": "Inga racemiflora, commonly known as the clustered inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, racemose inflorescences that produce small, fragrant flowers. The plant has compound leaves with pinnate arrangement and is often found in humid, lowland forests. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic root nodules. The tree is also valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
