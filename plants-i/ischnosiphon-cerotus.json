    "intro": "Ischnosiphon cerotus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface. Ischnosiphon cerotus is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
