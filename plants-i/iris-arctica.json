    "intro": "Iris arctica, commonly known as the arctic iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear showy blue or purple flowers with three petals and three sepals. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to withstand cold and harsh conditions. Iris arctica plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in fragile environments."
