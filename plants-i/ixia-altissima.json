    "intro": "Ixia altissima, commonly known as the tall flame lily, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy orange-red flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Ixia altissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to well-drained, sunny gardens."
