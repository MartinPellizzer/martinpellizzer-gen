    "intro": "Impatiens meeboldii, commonly known as the Meebold's impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers that typically come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other impatiens species."
