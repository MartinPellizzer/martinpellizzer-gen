    "intro": "Ilex nebulosa, commonly known as the misty holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a waxy texture and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex nebulosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable climate conditions."
