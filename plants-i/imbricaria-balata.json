    "intro": "Imbricaria balata, commonly known as the Brazilian velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by round, greenish-brown seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
