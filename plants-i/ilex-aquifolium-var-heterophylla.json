It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The leaves are typically spiny and have a glossy, dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
