    "intro": "Isnardia repens, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it ideal for ground cover in gardens. Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing characteristics with other members such as mint and sage."
