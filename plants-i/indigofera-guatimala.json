It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and benefits surrounding vegetation. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
