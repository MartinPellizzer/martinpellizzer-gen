It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white or pale blue throat. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal rosette. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and resilience in well-drained soils."
