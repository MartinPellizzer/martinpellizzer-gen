    "intro": "Ipomoea oreophila, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually violet or blue in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its vines can climb or trail along the ground. Ipomoea oreophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
