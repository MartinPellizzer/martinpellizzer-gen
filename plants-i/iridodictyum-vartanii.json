It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is noted for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil nutrients. Iridodictyum vartanii plays a minor ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
