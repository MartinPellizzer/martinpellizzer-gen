    "intro": "Isoplesion italicum, commonly known as the Italian isoplesion, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers, which bloom in early summer, are usually white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Isoplesion italicum is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
