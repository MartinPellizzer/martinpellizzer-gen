    "intro": "Iris cengialti subsp. vochinensis, commonly known as the Vochna iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are sword-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable addition to alpine gardens."
