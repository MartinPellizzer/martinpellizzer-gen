    "intro": "Iocenes virens, commonly known as the greenleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Iocenes virens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and subtle floral display make it a sought-after ornamental plant in horticultural collections."
