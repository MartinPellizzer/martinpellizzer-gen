    "intro": "Isachne muscicola, commonly known as the mossy isachne, is a grass species native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense mats on moist, shaded ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland and riparian ecosystems."
