It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the stems are typically hairless. Ixeris scaposa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
