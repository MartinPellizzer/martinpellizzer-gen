    "intro": "Ilex loheri, commonly known as the Loher holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex loheri thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedges and landscape plantings."
