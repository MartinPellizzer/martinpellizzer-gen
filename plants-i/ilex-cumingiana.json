    "intro": "Ilex cumingiana, commonly known as Cuming's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, with dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex cumingiana typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical gardens."
