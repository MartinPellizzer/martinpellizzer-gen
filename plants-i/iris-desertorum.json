    "intro": "Iris desertorum, commonly known as the desert iris, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Iris desertorum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
