    "intro": "Ipomopsis congesta var. montana, commonly known as mountain ipomopsis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
