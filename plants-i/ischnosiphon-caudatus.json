It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clustered inflorescences called cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Ischnosiphon caudatus is noted for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a common sight in riparian habitats."
