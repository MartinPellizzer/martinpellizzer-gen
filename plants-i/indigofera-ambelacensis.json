    "intro": "Indigofera ambelacensis, commonly known as the Malagasy indigo plant, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in its native habitat."
