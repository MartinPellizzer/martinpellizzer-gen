    "intro": "Ipomoea patula, commonly known as the blue morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can be irritating to the skin. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils. Ipomoea patula is a fast-growing species that can spread rapidly, making it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain regions."
