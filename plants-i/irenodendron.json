    "intro": "Irenodendron, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often orange or red, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are often ovate or elliptical in shape. Irenodendron species are native to tropical regions of South America and are valued for their ornamental appeal. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
