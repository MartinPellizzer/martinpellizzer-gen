    "intro": "Indigofera ammoxylon, commonly known as the rock indigo, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, coastal or desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in harsh climates."
