    "intro": "Ipomoea leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as a vine, climbing or sprawling along the ground, and produces seeds in capsule fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
