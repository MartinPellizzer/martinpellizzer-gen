    "intro": "Iris loessicola, commonly known as the Loess Iris, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Loess Plateau of China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found growing in open, sunny areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iris loessicola is considered an endangered species."
