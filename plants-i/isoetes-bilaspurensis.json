    "intro": "Isoetes bilaspurensis, commonly known as the Bilaspur watermoss, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its unique, spiky, and often submerged morphology, with a central axis covered in spikelets. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving or still waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its sporangia are clustered in dense, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the spikelets. Isoetes bilaspurensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to sediment stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
