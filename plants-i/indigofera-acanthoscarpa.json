    "intro": "Indigofera acanthoscarpa, commonly known as the African indigo or African blue bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces striking clusters of violet to blue flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the action of the pod's elasticity. Indigofera acanthoscarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in various cultural and medicinal contexts."
