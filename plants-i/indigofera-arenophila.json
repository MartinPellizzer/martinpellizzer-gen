    "intro": "Indigofera arenophila, commonly known as the sand indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, and its ability to thrive in sandy soils. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in coastal dunes and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion."
