    "intro": "Ixora rhodesiaca, commonly known as the Rhodesian flame or red flame bush, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces showy clusters of bright red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its bark is smooth and reddish in color. Ixora rhodesiaca is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
