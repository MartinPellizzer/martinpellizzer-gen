It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in well-drained soils. Iris speculatrix is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun to partial shade conditions."
