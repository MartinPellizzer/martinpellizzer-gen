    "intro": "Ipomoea lapidosa, commonly known as the rock morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a common weed in disturbed areas. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
