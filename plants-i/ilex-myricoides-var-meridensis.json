It features dark green, leathery leaves that are glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
