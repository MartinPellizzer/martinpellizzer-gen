    "intro": "Ichnanthus neblinaensis, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences and small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky outcrops. Its botanical features include elongated, strap-like leaves and a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted habitat and susceptibility to deforestation, Ichnanthus neblinaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
