It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often opening in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can climb supports or trellises. The seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny pod that splits open when mature."
