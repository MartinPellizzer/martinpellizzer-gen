    "intro": "Indigofera heterotricha var. rhodesiana, commonly known as Rhodesian indigo, is a leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems that often grow in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural systems. Its ornamental value and ecological role in arid environments contribute to its significance in local ecosystems."
