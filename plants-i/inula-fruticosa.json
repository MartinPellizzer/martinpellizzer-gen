    "intro": "Inula fruticosa, commonly known as the everlasting flower or yellow fleabane, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are gray-green, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs. Inula fruticosa is known for its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color and form even when dried, making it a popular choice for floral arrangements."
