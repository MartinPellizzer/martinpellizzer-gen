    "intro": "Iriartea klopstockia, commonly known as the Klopstock\u2019s giant cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a trait typical of cycads, and has a slow growth rate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
