It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
