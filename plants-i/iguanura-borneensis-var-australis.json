It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and fibrous roots, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. This variety is notable for its adaptability to high humidity and partial shade, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
