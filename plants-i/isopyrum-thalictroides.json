    "intro": "Isopyrum thalictroides, commonly known as the false rue-anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, woodlands and stream banks, reaching heights of about 15 to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately divided, with five to seven lobes, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and showy, actinomorphic flowers that are often mistaken for those of the true anemone species. Isopyrum thalictroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
