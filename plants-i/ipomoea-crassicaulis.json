It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit and vigorous vines make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
