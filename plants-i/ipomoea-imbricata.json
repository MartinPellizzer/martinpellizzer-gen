    "intro": "Ipomoea imbricata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
