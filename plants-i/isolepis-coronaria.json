    "intro": "Isolepis coronaria, commonly known as the crowned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along the edges of lakes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Isolepis coronaria plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
