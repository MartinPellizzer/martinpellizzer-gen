    "intro": "Iris uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower iris, is a species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb with grass-like leaves and a single, showy blue or violet flower that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flower's structure includes three inner petals (called standards) and three outer petals (called falls), which are characteristic of the iris family."
