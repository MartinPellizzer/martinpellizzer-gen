    "intro": "Isostigma simplicifolium var. riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's simple-leaved isostigma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, providing structural support for its delicate inflorescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
