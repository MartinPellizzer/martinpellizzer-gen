    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. microphylla, commonly known as Japanese holly or dwarf Japanese holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is highly valued in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. This variety is also known for its slow growth rate and tolerance to urban environments."
