    "intro": "Isomacrolobium gabunense, commonly known as the Gabon macrolobium, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces woody capsules as its fruit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
