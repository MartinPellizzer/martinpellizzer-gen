It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are sword-shaped and often form a basal rosette, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Iris serotina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
