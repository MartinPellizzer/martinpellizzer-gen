    "intro": "Ipomoea reptans var. heterophylla, commonly known as the creeping blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape, hence the varietal name *heterophylla*. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, opening in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or in hanging baskets."
