    "intro": "Ilex prunifolia, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Ilex prunifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
