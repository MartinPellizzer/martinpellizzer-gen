    "intro": "Isoberlinia doka, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and deep root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is often found in savanna woodlands and is valued for its durable timber and traditional uses. Isoberlinia doka also plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
