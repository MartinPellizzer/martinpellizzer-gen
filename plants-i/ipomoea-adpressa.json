    "intro": "Ipomoea adpressa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows close to the ground, spreading via runners and forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a common weed and an important ecological indicator species."
