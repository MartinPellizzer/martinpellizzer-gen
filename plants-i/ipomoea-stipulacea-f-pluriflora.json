    "intro": "Ipomoea stipulacea f. pluriflora, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and moist hammocks. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate salt spray make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
