    "intro": "Iris hortensis, commonly known as the garden iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form clumps over time. Iris hortensis is native to Europe and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
