    "intro": "Ionidium riparium, commonly known as the riverbank waterplant, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters near riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color. Ionidium riparium plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
