    "intro": "Ichnanthus piresii, commonly known as the Piresii's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that bears small, delicate flowers with a distinctively shaped lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ichnanthus piresii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
