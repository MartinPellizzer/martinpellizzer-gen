    "intro": "Iberis pruitii subsp. lagascana, commonly known as the Lagascana candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage, which helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
