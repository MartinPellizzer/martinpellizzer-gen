    "intro": "Ischnocarpus exilis, commonly known as the slender false dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, pale green leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ischnocarpus exilis is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky areas."
