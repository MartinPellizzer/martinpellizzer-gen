    "intro": "Ilex latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to landscapes. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its dense foliage and year-round interest make it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental planting."
