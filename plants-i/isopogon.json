    "intro": "Isopogon, commonly known as the golden candlebush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. These shrubs are native to southern Australia and are characterized by their dense, often evergreen foliage and striking yellow or orange flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in cylindrical spikes and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Isopogon species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in gardens for their hardy nature and drought tolerance. They also play a role in supporting local wildlife, providing nectar for birds and insects."
