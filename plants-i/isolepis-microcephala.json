    "intro": "Isolepis microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Isolepis microcephala is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
