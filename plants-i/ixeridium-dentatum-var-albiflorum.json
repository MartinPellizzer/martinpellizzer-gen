    "intro": "Ixeridium dentatum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflowered sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Ixeridium dentatum var. albiflorum is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to coastal and inland dunes."
