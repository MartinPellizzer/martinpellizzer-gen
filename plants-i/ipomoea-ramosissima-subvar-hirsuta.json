    "intro": "Ipomoea ramosissima subvar. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a vigorous annual vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped, pale green leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the morning and closing by midday. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing along fences, walls, or in disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
