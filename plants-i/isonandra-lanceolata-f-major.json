    "intro": "Isonandra lanceolata f. major, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are typically lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its robust growth and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
