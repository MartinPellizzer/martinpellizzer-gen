    "intro": "Impatiens munnarensis, commonly known as the Munnar impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
