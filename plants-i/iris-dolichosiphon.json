    "intro": "Iris dolichosiphon, commonly known as the slender beak iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive beak-like spur at the base of the petals. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Iris dolichosiphon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
