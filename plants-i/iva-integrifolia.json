    "intro": "Iva integrifolia, commonly known as the common marshelder, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in clusters. Iva integrifolia is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
