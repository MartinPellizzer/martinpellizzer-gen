    "intro": "Ixia tenella, commonly known as the silver flame lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces striking, fiery orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients. Ixia tenella thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and unique coloration."
