    "intro": "Ibetralia, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers with red and orange markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Ibetralia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
