It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is widely cultivated as a ornamental plant for its dense foliage and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. Ilex crenata var. scoriarum is often used in landscaping for hedges and topiary due to its slow growth and hardy nature."
