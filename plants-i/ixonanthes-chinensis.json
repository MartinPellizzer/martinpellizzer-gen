    "intro": "Ixonanthes chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese starfruit, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its striking, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often mistaken for starfruit due to their star-shaped appearance. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Ixonanthes chinensis is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
