    "intro": "Isolepis ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands and forest margins. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
