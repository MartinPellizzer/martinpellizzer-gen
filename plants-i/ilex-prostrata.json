    "intro": "Ilex prostrata, commonly known as creeping winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with cascading clusters of bright red berries that appear in the winter. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Ilex prostrata is valued for its ornamental berries and its ability to provide food for wildlife during the winter months."
