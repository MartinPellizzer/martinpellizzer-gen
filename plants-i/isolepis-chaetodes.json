    "intro": "Isolepis chaetodes, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes and pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late summer. Isolepis chaetodes plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
