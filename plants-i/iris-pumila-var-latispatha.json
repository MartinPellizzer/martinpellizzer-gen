It features slender, creeping rhizomes and produces clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often form a dense mat on the ground. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable habitats."
