    "intro": "Iria biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered iria, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, often with two flowers per inflorescence, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Iria biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
