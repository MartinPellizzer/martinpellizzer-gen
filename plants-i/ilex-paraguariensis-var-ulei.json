    "intro": "Ilex paraguariensis var. ulei, commonly known as the Brazilian holly or ulei, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is closely related to the yerba mate plant and belongs to the Aquifoliaceae family. The plant is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves and produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. The leaves are often used for making tea, similar to yerba mate, and are valued for their caffeine and xanthine content. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in the understory of forests."
