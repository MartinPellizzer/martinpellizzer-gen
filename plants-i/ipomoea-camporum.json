    "intro": "Ipomoea camporum, commonly known as the Florida morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found growing along stream banks and in moist woodlands. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a desirable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas. The seeds are dispersed by birds and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
