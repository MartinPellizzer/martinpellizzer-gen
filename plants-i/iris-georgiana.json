It features sword-shaped, grass-like leaves and striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed upper petal. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and blooms in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
