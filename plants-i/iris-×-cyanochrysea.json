    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 cyanochrysea, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a hybrid perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an effective wetland stabilizer. The leaves are sword-shaped, narrow, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vivid flower colors."
