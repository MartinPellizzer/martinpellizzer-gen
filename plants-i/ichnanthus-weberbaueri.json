    "intro": "Ichnanthus weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and has a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
