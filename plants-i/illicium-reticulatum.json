    "intro": "Illicium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined star anise, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Schisandraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruit that resembles the spice star anise. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit develops from a single flower and contains several oil-rich seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
