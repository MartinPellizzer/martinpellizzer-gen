It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Inga leptingoides is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
