    "intro": "Isopogon attenuatus var. angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces cylindrical, yellowish flower spikes that bloom in winter. The plant is part of the Proteaceae family and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
