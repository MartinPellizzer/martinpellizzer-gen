    "intro": "Ichthyothere garcia-barrigae, commonly known as the Garcia-Barriga's ichthyothere, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are covered in a dense, waxy cuticle to retain moisture in its humid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and moths. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded understory conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
