    "intro": "Ischnosiphon neotericus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in wetland environments. Ischnosiphon neotericus plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
