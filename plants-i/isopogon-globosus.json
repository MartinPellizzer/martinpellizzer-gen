    "intro": "Isopogon globosus, commonly known as the globular honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, cylindrical stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spherical seed pods. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a rough texture, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Isopogon globosus is adapted to dry conditions and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
