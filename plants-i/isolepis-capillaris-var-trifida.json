    "intro": "Isolepis capillaris var. trifida, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, cylindrical flower spikes that emerge from the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that stabilize shoreline areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind for pollination. This variant is distinguished by its trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Isolepis capillaris."
