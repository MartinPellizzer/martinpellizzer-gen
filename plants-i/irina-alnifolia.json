    "intro": "Irina alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Irina alnifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
