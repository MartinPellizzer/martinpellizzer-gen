    "intro": "Ilex ambigua var. macropoda, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a humid climate."
