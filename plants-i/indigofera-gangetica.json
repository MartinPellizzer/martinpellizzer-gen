    "intro": "Indigofera gangetica, commonly known as Indian indigo, is a flowering plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and showy blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils, and it prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical significance lies in its historical use in dye production, particularly for producing the deep blue color associated with traditional textiles."
