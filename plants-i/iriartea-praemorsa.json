    "intro": "Iriartea praemorsa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the rainforests of northern South America. It is characterized by its massive, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Iriartea praemorsa is a slow-growing species that can live for hundreds of years. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
