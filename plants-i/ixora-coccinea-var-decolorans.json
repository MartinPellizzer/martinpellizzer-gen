    "intro": "Ixora coccinea var. decolorans, commonly known as the decoloring flame tree, is a variant of the ixora plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that gradually fade to a lighter pink or even white as they age, giving it its common name. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hedge due to its compact growth habit. The flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
