    "intro": "Isolepis tenuis, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences of spikelets. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Isolepis tenuis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
