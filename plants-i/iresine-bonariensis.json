    "intro": "Iresine bonariensis, commonly known as the flame flower or red leaf plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored foliage, which can range from deep red to violet and pink hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which appear in clusters. Iresine bonariensis thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and as a landscape plant in tropical regions."
