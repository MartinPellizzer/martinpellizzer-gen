    "intro": "Isatis transsilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian woad, is a perennial herb native to Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. Its historical significance lies in its use for producing indigo dye, similar to its more well-known relative, Isatis tinctoria."
