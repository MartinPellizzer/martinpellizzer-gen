    "intro": "Isachne hispidula, commonly known as the hairy isachne, is a small grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on the underside, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of tiny flowers. Isachne hispidula is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
