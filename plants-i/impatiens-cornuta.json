    "intro": "Impatiens cornuta, commonly known as the horned impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like calyx that encloses the flower buds, giving it its unique appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Impatiens cornuta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
