    "intro": "Isolepis globosa, commonly known as the globular bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It forms dense, spherical clusters of flowering heads, which are typically composed of small, spike-like structures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing shoreline habitats."
