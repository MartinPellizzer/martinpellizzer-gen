    "intro": "Ilex peragua, commonly known as the Peragua holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex peragua thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky coastal habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
