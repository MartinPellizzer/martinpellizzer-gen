    "intro": "Inga candida, commonly known as white inga, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy white flowers. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common species in secondary forests. Its fruit is a pod containing edible seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Inga candida is also valued for its timber and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
