    "intro": "Ilex cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is notable for its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and subsequently fruits develop directly on the trunk and older branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
