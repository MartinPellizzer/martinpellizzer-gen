    "intro": "Isoloma pardinum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. Isoloma pardinum is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
