    "intro": "Ilex megistocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex megistocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly in forest ecosystems."
