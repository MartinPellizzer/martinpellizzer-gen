    "intro": "Iris papilionacea, commonly known as the fringed iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive white or pale yellow center. The flowers have three outer petals that are broader and more showy than the inner three, giving it a papilionaceous appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
