    "intro": "Impatiens linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, spurred flowers that come in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Impatiens linearifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
