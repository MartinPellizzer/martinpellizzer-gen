    "intro": "Isoetes tegulensis, commonly known as the rock fern moss, is a species of water plantain belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a structure known as a sorus. This plant is typically found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as wetlands and marshes. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, with a distinct midrib and a waxy coating. Isoetes tegulensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
