    "intro": "Ilex corymbosa, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex corymbosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in USDA zones 7 through 10. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a versatile plant for both natural and cultivated environments."
