    "intro": "Icomum biformifolium, commonly known as the two-leaf fern, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed fronds that resemble a split leaf, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
