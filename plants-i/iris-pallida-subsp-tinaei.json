It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three spreading sepals. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale coloration and specific habitat preferences."
