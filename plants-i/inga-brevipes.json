    "intro": "Inga brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed inga, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy and rapid growth rate. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Inga brevipes is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
