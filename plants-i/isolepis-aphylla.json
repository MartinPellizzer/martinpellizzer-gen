    "intro": "Isolepis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other similar plants. This plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only flowering spikes emerging from a basal rosette of sterile stems. Isolepis aphylla typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and pond margins. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
