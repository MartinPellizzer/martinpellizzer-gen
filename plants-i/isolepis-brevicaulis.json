    "intro": "Isolepis brevicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit forming tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often concealed within the foliage. Isolepis brevicaulis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
