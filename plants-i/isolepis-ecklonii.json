    "intro": "Isolepis ecklonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Isolepis ecklonii is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
