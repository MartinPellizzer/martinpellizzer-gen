    "intro": "Impatiens quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Impatiens quadriloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
