    "intro": "Ilex rotunda var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a decorative hedge or specimen plant."
