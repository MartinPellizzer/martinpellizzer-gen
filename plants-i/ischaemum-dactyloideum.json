    "intro": "Ischaemum dactyloideum, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats or tufts, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
