    "intro": "Impatiens jurpia var. jurpioides, commonly known as the dwarf impatiens, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
