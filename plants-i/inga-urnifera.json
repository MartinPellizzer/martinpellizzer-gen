    "intro": "Inga urnifera, commonly known as the urn-leaf inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, urn-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
