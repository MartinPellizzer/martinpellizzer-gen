    "intro": "Impatiens brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces seed pods that split open when mature, dispersing seeds by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Impatiens brevipes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
