    "intro": "Ichnanthus lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies. Ichnanthus lanceolatus plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
