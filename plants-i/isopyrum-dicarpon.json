    "intro": "Isopyrum dicarpon, commonly known as the two-seeded burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive bur-like fruits that contain two seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. Isopyrum dicarpon thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
