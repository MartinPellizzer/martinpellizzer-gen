    "intro": "Ivesia lycopodioides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Ivesia lycopodioides thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine forests or shaded rock crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
