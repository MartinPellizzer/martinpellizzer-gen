    "intro": "Ipomoea fulvicaulis var. fulvicaulis, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a herbaceous annual vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The flowers open in the morning and close by late afternoon, hence its common name."
