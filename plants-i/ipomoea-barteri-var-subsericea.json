    "intro": "Ipomoea barteri var. subsericea, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind and animals."
