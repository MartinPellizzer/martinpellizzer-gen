    "intro": "Iris korolkowii, commonly known as the Siberian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive white or pale yellow center. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
