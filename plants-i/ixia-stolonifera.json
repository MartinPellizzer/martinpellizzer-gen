    "intro": "Ixia stolonifera, commonly known as the yellow ox-eye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It produces vibrant yellow flowers with a prominent central disk, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features a fibrous root system and exhibits stoloniferous growth, allowing it to spread horizontally along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette. Ixia stolonifera is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
