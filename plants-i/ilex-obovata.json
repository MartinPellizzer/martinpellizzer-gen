    "intro": "Ilex obovata, commonly known as the southern wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its evergreen-like foliage and aromatic leaves make it a popular ornamental plant. Ilex obovata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
