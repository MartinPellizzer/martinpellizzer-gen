    "intro": "Isodon angustifolius var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous narrow-leaved honeysuckle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are typically hairless or very sparsely hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in forest edges or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
