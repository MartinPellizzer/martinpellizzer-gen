    "intro": "Iria scaberrima, commonly known as the roughleaf iria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, red berries. Iria scaberrima is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its leaves are rough and hairy, contributing to its common name and providing some protection against herbivores."
