It is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the star anise (Illicium verum). Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant's botanical features make it valuable for both ornamental purposes and potential medicinal applications."
