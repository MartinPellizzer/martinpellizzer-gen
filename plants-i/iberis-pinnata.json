    "intro": "Iberis pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are pinnately divided, giving the plant its scientific name, and they are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
