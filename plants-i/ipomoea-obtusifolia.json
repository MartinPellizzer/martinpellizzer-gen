    "intro": "Ipomoea obtusifolia, commonly known as morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny capsule that splits open when mature. Ipomoea obtusifolia is often cultivated for ornamental purposes but can become invasive in some regions."
