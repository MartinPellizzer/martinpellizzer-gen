    "intro": "Iridorkis lunata, commonly known as the moonlit iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers with a unique bi-color pattern. The flowers typically bloom in late spring and early summer, featuring a deep violet-purple hue on the outer petals and a pale white or cream center. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in botanical gardens and specialized horticulture."
