    "intro": "Iberis bicolor, commonly known as the white and yellow candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in white and yellow hues. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and hairy, while the stems are covered with fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Iberis bicolor is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
