    "intro": "Ipomoea noctiluca, commonly known as moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy blooms that attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it popular in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions. The species is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
