    "intro": "Ionoxalis dimidiata, commonly known as the half-leaf sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often divided into two distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
