It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, azure-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Isolobus roxburghianus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
