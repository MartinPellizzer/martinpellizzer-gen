    "intro": "Inga stenopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for reforestation and soil enrichment. Inga stenopoda is also cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fodder."
