    "intro": "Indigastrum parviflorum subsp. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered indigastrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth margin and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among plants in its ecological niche. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively short flowering period."
