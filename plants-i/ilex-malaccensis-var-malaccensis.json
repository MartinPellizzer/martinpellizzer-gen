    "intro": "Ilex malaccensis var. malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and seasonal fruit display."
