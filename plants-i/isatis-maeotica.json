    "intro": "Isatis maeotica, commonly known as the Crimean woad, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically broad and lobed. Isatis maeotica is characterized by its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland ecosystems. It has been historically used for its potential medicinal properties, though its use is less common today compared to other members of its family."
