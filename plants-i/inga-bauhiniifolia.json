    "intro": "Inga bauhiniifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pea tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for reforestation and soil enrichment."
