It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Isolepis meruensis produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
