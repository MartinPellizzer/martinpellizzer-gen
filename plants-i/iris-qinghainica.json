It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its hardiness in cold climates. The Qinghai iris is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
