    "intro": "Isolepis racemosa, commonly known as the tufted spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Isolepis racemosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
