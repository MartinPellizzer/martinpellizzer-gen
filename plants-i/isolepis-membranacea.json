    "intro": "Isolepis membranacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its slender, cylindrical stems are covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces tiny, spike-like clusters of flowers. Isolepis membranacea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
