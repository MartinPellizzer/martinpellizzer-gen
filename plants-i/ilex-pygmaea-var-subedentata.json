It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for privacy screens or as a specimen plant."
