    "intro": "Indigofera oblonga, commonly known as African indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are often used in traditional medicine. Indigofera oblonga is also cultivated for its dye-producing properties, though it is less commonly used than other indigo species."
