It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Indigastrum costatum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
