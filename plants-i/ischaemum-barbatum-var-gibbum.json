It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered along the stem, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers."
