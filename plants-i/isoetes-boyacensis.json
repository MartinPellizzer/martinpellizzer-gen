    "intro": "Isoetes boyacensis, commonly known as the Boyac\u00e1 watermace, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a structure known as a strobilus. This plant is native to South America, specifically found in the Andean regions of Colombia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds, often growing in shallow, still waters. The plant's morphology includes a rhizome with leaves that are often submerged, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
