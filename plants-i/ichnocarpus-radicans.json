    "intro": "Ichnocarpus radicans, commonly known as the spreading horse-gram, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has slender, twining stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground or climb other vegetation. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods. The seeds are enclosed in hard, ribbed capsules, which are adapted for dispersal by animals or through mechanical means."
