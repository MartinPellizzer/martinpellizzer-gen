    "intro": "Ipomoea saccata, commonly known as the sandpiper vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple throat. Ipomoea saccata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it suitable for trellises, hanging baskets, or as a ground cover."
