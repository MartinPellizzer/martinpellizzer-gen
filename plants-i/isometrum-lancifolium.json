    "intro": "Isometrum lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved isometrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lanceolate, hence the species name, with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Isometrum lancifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
