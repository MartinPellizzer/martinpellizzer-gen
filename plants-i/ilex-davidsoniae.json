    "intro": "Ilex davidsoniae, commonly known as David's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex davidsoniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its year-round foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable plant for temperate climates."
