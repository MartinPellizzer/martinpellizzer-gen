It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance for pollution and compacted soils. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide year-round visual interest."
