    "intro": "Isocoma latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a rough texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Isocoma latifolia is an important component of its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
