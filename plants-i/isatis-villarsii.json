    "intro": "Isatis villarsii, commonly known as the yellow flag or yellow isatis, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Isatis villarsii is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, fertile soils."
