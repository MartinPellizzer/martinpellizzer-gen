    "intro": "Impatiens parviflora var. brachycentra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical parviflora. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
