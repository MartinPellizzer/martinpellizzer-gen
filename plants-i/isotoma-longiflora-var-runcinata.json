It features small, silver-gray leaves that are lanceolate in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
