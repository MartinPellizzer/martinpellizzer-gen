    "intro": "Ichthyomethia mollis, commonly known as the soft aquatic fern, is a delicate aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, soft, and feathery leaves. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant's leaves are usually submerged, though some may extend above the water surface. It lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Ichthyomethia mollis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
