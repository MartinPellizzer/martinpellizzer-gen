It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in dry, open habitats. Ischaemum afrum is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
