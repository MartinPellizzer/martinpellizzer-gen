It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in gardens and natural habitats alike."
