    "intro": "Indigofera densa, commonly known as the dense indigo or African indigo, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, dark blue dye, which has been historically used for natural dyeing. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Indigofera densa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
