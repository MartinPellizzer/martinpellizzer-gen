    "intro": "Involucraria cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaved involucraria, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often deeply lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
