    "intro": "Ipomoea borneoensis, commonly known as Bornean morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
