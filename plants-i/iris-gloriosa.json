    "intro": "Iris gloriosa, commonly known as the glory iris, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white stripe running down the center. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late spring to early summer."
