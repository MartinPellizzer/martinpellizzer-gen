    "intro": "Isolepis chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden-fruited spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of yellowish-brown inflorescences that mature into small, fleshy, orange-red fruits. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as pond margins and damp meadows, where it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
