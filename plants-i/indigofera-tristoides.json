    "intro": "Indigofera tristoides, commonly known as the desert indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1-3 meters, characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often appearing in spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine and has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers."
