It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the early morning. The plant is native to Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for climbing structures or as a decorative ground cover. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
