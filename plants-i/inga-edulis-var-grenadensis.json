    "intro": "Inga edulis var. grenadensis, commonly known as the \"ice cream bean,\" is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The tree produces long, pod-like fruits that contain edible, sweet, and creamy seeds often used in traditional cuisine. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for agroforestry and soil enrichment. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental qualities."
