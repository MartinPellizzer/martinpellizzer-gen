    "intro": "Iberis glaucescens, commonly known as white candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
