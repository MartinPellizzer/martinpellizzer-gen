    "intro": "Iris cristata var. lacustris, commonly known as the lake iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white stripe along the dorsal sepal. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a fan shape at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near wetlands or along the edges of lakes. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat."
