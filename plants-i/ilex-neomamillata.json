    "intro": "Ilex neomamillata, commonly known as the New Mexico holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly New Mexico, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that have spiny margins. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex neomamillata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
