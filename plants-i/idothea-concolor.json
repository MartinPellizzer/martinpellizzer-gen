    "intro": "Idothea concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf corymbia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Idothea concolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
