    "intro": "Impatiens hians f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth impatiens, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has smooth, hairless foliage, giving it its \"glabra\" designation, meaning \"smooth\" in Latin. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
