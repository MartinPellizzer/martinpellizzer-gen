    "intro": "Ischyrolepis duthieae, commonly known as the Duthie's rock fern, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that help it anchor to steep and exposed terrain. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, often serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ischyrolepis duthieae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
