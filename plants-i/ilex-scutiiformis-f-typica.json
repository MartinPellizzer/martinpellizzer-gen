    "intro": "Ilex scutiiformis f. typica, commonly known as the typical form of the broadleaf holly, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its dense foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy texture and a slightly serrated edge."
