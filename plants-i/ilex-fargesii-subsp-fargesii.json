    "intro": "Ilex fargesii subsp. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used in rock gardens or as a specimen plant in landscaped settings."
