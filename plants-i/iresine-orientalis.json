    "intro": "Iresine orientalis, commonly known as the oriental flame flower, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features vibrant, bi-color leaves with a deep red or purple upper surface and a contrasting green underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, which are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Iresine orientalis is often cultivated for its eye-catching foliage rather than its flowers."
