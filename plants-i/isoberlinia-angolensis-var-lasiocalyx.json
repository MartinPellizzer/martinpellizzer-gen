    "intro": "Isoberlinia angolensis var. lasiocalyx, commonly known as the Angolan tamarind tree, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
