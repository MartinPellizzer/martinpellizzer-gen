    "intro": "Inga hispida, commonly known as the hairy inga, is a tropical tree belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, hairy textures. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in racemose inflorescences, and the tree produces pods that contain edible seeds. Inga hispida is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it an important component of agroforestry systems."
