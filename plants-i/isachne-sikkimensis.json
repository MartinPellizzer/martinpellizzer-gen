    "intro": "Isachne sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim isachne, is a grass species native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small flowering structures. Isachne sikkimensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
