    "intro": "Indigofera boviperda subsp. eremaea, commonly known as the desert indigo, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife in its native environment."
