    "intro": "Indigofera kerstingii, commonly known as Kersting's indigo, is a leguminous shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, enriching the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation projects."
