    "intro": "Isachne tricarinata, commonly known as the three-ribbed isachne, is a grass species native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with distinct three longitudinal ribs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers. Isachne tricarinata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
