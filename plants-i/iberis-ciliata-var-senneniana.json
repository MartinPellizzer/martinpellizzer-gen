    "intro": "Iberis ciliata var. senneniana, commonly known as the Sennenian winter jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. Its foliage consists of narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
