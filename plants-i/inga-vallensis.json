    "intro": "Inga vallensis, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, often referred to as a \"bean\" due to its shape. Inga vallensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
