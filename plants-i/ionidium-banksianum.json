It is native to the coastal regions of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun. The plant is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, yellowish flowers. It produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ionidium banksianum is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
