    "intro": "Indigofera dissitiflora var. tenuis, commonly known as narrow-leaved indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. Its root system has been traditionally used for dyeing fabrics due to the presence of indigoid compounds. The varietal form tenuis distinguishes it by its narrower leaf blades compared to other varieties of Indigofera dissitiflora."
