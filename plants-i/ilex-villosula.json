    "intro": "Ilex villosula, commonly known as the woolly holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is covered in fine, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Ilex villosula thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable climates."
