It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped white flowers that open in the early morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trellises. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance and are pollinated primarily by insects. Ipomoea tamnifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
