    "intro": "Ilex bioritsensis var. ciliospinosa, commonly known as the Ciliated Spiny Holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
