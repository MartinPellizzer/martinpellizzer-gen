    "intro": "Ilex pubescens var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and lack the fine hairs found in the typical Ilex pubescens. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild climates."
