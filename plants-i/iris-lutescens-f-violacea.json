    "intro": "Iris lutescens f. violacea, commonly known as the violet-flowered iris, is a botanical variant of the yellow iris species. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals, which contrast with its yellowish-green sepals. This form is typically found in wetland habitats, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, three-parted flowers. Its botanical interest lies in its color variation and its role in ecological systems."
