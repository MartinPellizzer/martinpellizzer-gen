    "intro": "Indigofera longimucronata, commonly known as the long-pointed indigo, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in elongated, slender pods that split open when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
