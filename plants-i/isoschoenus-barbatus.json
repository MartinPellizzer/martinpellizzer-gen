    "intro": "Isoschoenus barbatus, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is subtended by a bract with a distinctive barbed tip. Isoschoenus barbatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
