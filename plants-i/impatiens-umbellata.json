    "intro": "Impatiens umbellata, commonly known as the umbellate touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when disturbed. Impatiens umbellata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it a common sight in its native habitats."
