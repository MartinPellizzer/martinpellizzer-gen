    "intro": "Ixeris strigosa, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats. Ixeris strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
