    "intro": "Isertia haenkeana, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, and is adapted to cooler climates. Its leaves are usually palmate, with five to seven lobes, and the flowers range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Isertia haenkeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
