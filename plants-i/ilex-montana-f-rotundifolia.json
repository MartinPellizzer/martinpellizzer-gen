    "intro": "Ilex montana f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaved holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are rounded at the tip, distinguishing it from other holly varieties. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and attractive form make it suitable for use as a hedge or specimen plant."
