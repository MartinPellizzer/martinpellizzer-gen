It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces violet or blue flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It is typically found in wetland areas and can grow up to several meters in length. Ipomoea malvifolia is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
