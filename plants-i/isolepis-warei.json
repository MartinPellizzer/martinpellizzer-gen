    "intro": "Isolepis warei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and grassy slopes. Isolepis warei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
