It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a branched stem covered with fine, white hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Botanically, it is characterized by its aromatic leaves and is part of the Asteraceae family."
