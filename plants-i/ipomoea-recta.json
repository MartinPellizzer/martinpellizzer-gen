    "intro": "Ipomoea recta, commonly known as the straight morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length, making it a vigorous climber. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds and insects, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
