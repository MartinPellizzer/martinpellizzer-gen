    "intro": "Isolepis exigua, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in restoration projects due to their ability to prevent erosion. Isolepis exigua plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
