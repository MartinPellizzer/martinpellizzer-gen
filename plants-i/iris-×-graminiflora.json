    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 graminiflora, commonly known as the grass-like iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris pseudacorus and Iris sibirica. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
