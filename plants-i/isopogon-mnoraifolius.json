It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-red floral spikes. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The narrow, leathery leaves are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its adaptability in harsh environmental conditions."
