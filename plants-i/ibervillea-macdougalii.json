    "intro": "Ibervillea macdougalii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Its leaves are typically small, succulent, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Ibervillea macdougalii is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
