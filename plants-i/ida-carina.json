    "intro": "Ida carina, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its fruit, which resembles a small tamarind pod, contains seeds that can be planted to grow new plants. Ida carina thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
