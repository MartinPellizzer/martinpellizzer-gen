    "intro": "Iris lutescens subsp. subbiflora, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often classified as a noxious weed."
