    "intro": "Ipomoea eriosperma, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with sprawling vines that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, spiny capsule that splits open when mature to disperse the seeds."
