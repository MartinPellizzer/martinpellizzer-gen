    "intro": "Ilex kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex kinabaluensis is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in the cool, moist conditions of montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
