    "intro": "Ipomoea bonariensis var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a perennial climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to violet, often appearing in the early morning. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its specific variety name \"hispida.\" Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions. The flowers are typically trumpet-shaped and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
