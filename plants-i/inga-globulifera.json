    "intro": "Inga globulifera, commonly known as the globular inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Inga globulifera is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its natural habitat."
