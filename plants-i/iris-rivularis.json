    "intro": "Iris rivularis, commonly known as the river iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and streamside habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Iris rivularis has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil in riparian zones. It is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
