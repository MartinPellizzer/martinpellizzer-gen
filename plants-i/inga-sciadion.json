    "intro": "Inga sciadion, commonly known as the \"little umbrella tree,\" is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble an umbrella, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Inga sciadion is often valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade in tropical landscapes."
