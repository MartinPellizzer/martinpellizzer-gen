    "intro": "Ipomoea pandurata, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blooms that open in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature. Ipomoea pandurata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
