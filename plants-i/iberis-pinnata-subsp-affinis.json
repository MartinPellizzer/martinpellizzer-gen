    "intro": "Iberis pinnata subsp. affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with profuse clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are pinnately divided, giving the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is closely related to Iberis pinnata and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
