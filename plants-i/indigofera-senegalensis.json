    "intro": "Indigofera senegalensis, commonly known as African indigo, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces pods containing dark blue to black seeds, which have been traditionally used for dyeing textiles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays an important role in soil fertility and ecological balance."
