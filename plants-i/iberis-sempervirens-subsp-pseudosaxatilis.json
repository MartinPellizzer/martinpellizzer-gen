    "intro": "Iberis sempervirens subsp. pseudosaxatilis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it tolerates harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
