    "intro": "Ilex buxifolioides, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it suitable for hedges and topiaries. Ilex buxifolioides is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its resistance to pests and diseases."
