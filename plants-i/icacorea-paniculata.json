    "intro": "Icacorea paniculata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences known as paniculata, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed and have a rough, textured surface. Icacorea paniculata is well adapted to saline and coastal environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
