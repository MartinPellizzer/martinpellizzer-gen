    "intro": "Ilex maxima, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. Ilex maxima is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
