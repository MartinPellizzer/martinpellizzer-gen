    "intro": "Ichnocarpus oliganthus, commonly known as the African burr or sand bur, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive seed pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by tough, spiny fruits containing several seeds. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind or animals due to the hooked structures on the fruit, which aid in attachment to fur or clothing. Ichnocarpus oliganthus is adapted to arid and sandy environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
