    "intro": "Ionopsidium prolongoi, commonly known as the long-stemmed ionopsidium, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its elongated, wiry stems. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is often found in rocky or arid environments. Ionopsidium prolongoi has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is known for its ability to store water in its stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
