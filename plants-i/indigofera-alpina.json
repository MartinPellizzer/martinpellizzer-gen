    "intro": "Indigofera alpina, commonly known as alpine indigo, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are usually hairy to reduce water loss. Indigofera alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in high-altitude ecosystems."
