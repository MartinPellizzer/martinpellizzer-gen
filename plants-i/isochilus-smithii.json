    "intro": "Isochilus smithii, commonly known as the Smith's isochilus, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Isochilus smithii is considered endangered in its natural range."
