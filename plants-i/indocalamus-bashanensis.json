    "intro": "Indocalamus bashanensis, commonly known as the Bashan bamboo, is a species native to China, particularly in the Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces. It is a tall, slender bamboo that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with slender, green culms that are often used in traditional Chinese architecture and crafts. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the culms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. Its rapid growth and strong, flexible stalks make it a valuable resource for both ecological and practical purposes."
