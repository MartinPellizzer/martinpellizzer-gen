    "intro": "Icomum elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed ivy, is a climbing plant characterized by its trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported calming effects. Icomum elongatum is also valued in horticulture for its ability to cover walls and trellises effectively."
