    "intro": "Ipomoea lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb various structures make it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
