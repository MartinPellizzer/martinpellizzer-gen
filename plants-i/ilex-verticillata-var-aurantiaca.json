It is characterized by its striking red berries that persist through the winter, providing food for wildlife. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn bright red in the fall before dropping. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant seasonal color changes and unique fruiting habit."
