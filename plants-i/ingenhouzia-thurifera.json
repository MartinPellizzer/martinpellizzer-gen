    "intro": "Ingenhouzia thurifera, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid tropical climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, Ingenhouzia thurifera is considered endangered and is protected in its native environment."
