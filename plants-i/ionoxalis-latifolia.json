    "intro": "Ionoxalis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hairy textures, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Ionoxalis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
