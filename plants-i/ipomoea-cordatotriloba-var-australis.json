It is characterized by its heart-shaped, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple and blue, which bloom in the morning. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
