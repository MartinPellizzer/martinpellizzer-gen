    "intro": "Isonandra zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
