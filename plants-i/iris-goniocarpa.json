    "intro": "Iris goniocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved iris, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its robust rhizomes and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often reaching several feet in length. The flowers are usually blue or violet in color, with a distinctive three-lobed structure that sets it apart from other iris species."
