    "intro": "Ilex uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It has a slow growth rate and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Ilex uniflora is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife in forested areas."
