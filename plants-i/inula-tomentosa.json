    "intro": "Inula tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly fleabane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sturdy, upright stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and also covered in fine, soft hairs. Inula tomentosa is often found in dry grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
