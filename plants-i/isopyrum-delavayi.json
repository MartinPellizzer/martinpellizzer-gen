    "intro": "Isopyrum delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Asia, including regions of China, India, and Nepal. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to arid and rocky environments. Isopyrum delavayi is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
