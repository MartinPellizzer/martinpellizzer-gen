    "intro": "Iris alata var. cupreata, commonly known as the copper iris, is a striking ornamental plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive copper-colored beard on the lower petals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for wetland or bog gardens. Its foliage consists of grass-like leaves that are dark green and narrow, adding texture to the landscape. The copper iris is valued for its unique coloration and is often used in water gardens or as a border plant."
