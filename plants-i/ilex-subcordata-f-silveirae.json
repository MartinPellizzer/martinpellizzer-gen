It features small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well adapted to shady, moist environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in warm climates."
