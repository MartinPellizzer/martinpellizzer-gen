    "intro": "Iris missouriensis var. pelogonus, commonly known as the Missouri gentian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
