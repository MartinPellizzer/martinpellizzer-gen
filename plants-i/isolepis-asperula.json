    "intro": "Isolepis asperula, commonly known as rough spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that gives it its common name. Isolepis asperula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
