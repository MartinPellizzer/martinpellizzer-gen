    "intro": "Isolepis dura, commonly known as rigid spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds, where it forms dense stands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in stabilizing soil, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Isolepis dura is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions."
