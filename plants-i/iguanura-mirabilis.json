    "intro": "Iguanura mirabilis, commonly known as the red-veined sapote, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green bark and large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both ornamental horticulture and as a food source. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
