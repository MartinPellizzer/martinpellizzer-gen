    "intro": "Inga myriocephala, commonly known as the \"Brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain up to 20 seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Inga myriocephala plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
