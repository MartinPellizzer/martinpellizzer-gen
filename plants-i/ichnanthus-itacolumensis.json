    "intro": "Ichnanthus itacolumensis, commonly known as the Itacolumi orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Brazil. This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. The plant's botanical features include long, narrow leaves and intricate floral structures that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ichnanthus itacolumensis is considered a vulnerable species."
