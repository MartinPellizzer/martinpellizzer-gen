    "intro": "Inga tessmannii, commonly known as the yellow inga, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays an important ecological role in soil enrichment and habitat restoration."
