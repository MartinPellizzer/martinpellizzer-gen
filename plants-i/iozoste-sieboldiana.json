    "intro": "Iozoste sieboldiana, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
