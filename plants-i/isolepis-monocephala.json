    "intro": "Isolepis monocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant forms dense tussocks with upright, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis monocephala plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
