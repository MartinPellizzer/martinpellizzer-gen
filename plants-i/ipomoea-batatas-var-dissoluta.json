    "intro": "Ipomoea batatas var. dissoluta, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a tropical perennial vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, variegated foliage that ranges from green to purple and gold. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late summer. Its tuberous roots, while not as commonly cultivated as the standard sweet potato, are edible and have a slightly sweeter flavor. This variety is often grown as an ornamental plant for its colorful leaves and is well-suited to warm, humid climates."
