    "intro": "Ilex cornuta var. fortunei, commonly known as the Fortune's holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its spiny, alternate leaves that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its hardy nature and attractive foliage make it a valuable addition to gardens in temperate climates."
