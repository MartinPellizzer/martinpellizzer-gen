    "intro": "Icica trianensis, commonly known as the Trianese icica, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Icica trianensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
