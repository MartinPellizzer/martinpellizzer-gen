    "intro": "Ipomoea altoparanaensis, commonly known as the Parana morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in riverbanks and forest edges. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a common ornamental species in some regions. The flowers bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name."
