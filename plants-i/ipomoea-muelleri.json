It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is characterized by its rapid growth habit. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
