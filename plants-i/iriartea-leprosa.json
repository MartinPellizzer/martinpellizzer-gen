    "intro": "Iriartea leprosa, commonly known as the Leprous Pitcher Plant, is a species of epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a stout, woody stem and a rosette of broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric humidity to flourish. Iriartea leprosa is notable for its carnivorous nature, which helps it obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
