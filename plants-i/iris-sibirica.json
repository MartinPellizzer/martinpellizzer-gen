    "intro": "Iris sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves and tall, slender stems that bear showy, blue to purple flowers with a distinctive dark veining. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, three-petaled flowers that are highly ornamental. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens and bog landscapes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological value in natural habitats."
