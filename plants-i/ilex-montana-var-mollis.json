    "intro": "Ilex montana var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are soft to the touch, distinguishing it from other holly varieties. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded gardens."
