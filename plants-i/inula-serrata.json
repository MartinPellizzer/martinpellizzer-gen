It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are serrated and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Inula serrata is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
