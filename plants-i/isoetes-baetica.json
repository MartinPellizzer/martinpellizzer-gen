    "intro": "Isoetes baetica, commonly known as the Spanish water clover, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its unique, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in freshwater environments. Isoetes baetica has a complex morphology, with a distinct spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll. It plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
