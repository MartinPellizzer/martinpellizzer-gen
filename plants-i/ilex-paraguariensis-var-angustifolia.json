    "intro": "Ilex paraguariensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as Brazilian holly or yerba mate, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant features alternate, lanceolate leaves that are glossy and dark green on the upper surface. Its small, white flowers are followed by bright red berries containing one or two seeds. This variety is closely related to the plant used for making mate tea, which is valued for its stimulant properties due to the presence of caffeine and other compounds."
