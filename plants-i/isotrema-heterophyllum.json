It is native to parts of North America, particularly the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Isotrema heterophyllum is often found in association with other woodland flora and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
