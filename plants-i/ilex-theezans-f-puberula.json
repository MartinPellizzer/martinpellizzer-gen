    "intro": "Ilex theezans f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent ilex, is a variant of the evergreen holly species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy, or pubescent, foliage, which distinguishes it from other forms of Ilex. The leaves are typically elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a characteristic feature of the genus. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
