    "intro": "Ipomoea pentadactylis var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not controlled."
