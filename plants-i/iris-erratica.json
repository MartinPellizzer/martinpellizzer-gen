    "intro": "Iris erratica, commonly known as the wandering iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features grass-like basal leaves and striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its native habitat. Iris erratica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
