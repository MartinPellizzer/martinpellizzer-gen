    "intro": "Iris lutescens var. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense Iris, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to golden orange flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in suitable habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
