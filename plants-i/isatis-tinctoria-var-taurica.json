    "intro": "Isatis tinctoria var. taurica, commonly known as the Crimean woad, is a variant of the common woad plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by spherical, dark blue or black seed pods. It is cultivated for its historical use in producing indigo dye, though its role in modern dye production has diminished. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various temperate climates."
