    "intro": "Intsia madagascariensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a large tropical tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has a straight trunk and broad, spreading crown with pinnate leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
