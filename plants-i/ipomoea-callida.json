    "intro": "Ipomoea callida, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that come in various shades of green, red, and purple. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in clusters. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover. While it is not related to the edible sweet potato, it shares the same genus as the sweet potato."
