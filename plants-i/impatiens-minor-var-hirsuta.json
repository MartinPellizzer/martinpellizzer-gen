    "intro": "Impatiens minor var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming from summer to autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a desirable ornamental plant and a potential weed in some environments."
