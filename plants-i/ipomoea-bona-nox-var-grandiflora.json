    "intro": "Ipomoea bona-nox var. grandiflora, commonly known as the evening trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The flowers open in the late afternoon and emit a strong, sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective climbing plant, often seen in gardens and natural habitats. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
