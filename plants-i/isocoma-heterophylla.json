It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as hairy leaves to reduce water loss. Its leaves vary in shape and size along the stem, a trait known as heterophylly, which is a notable botanical feature. Isocoma heterophylla produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators."
