    "intro": "Iberidella tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan ibera, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iberidella tibetica is considered a sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystem health."
