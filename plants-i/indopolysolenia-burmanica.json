    "intro": "Indopolysolenia burmanica, commonly known as the Burmese liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant forms dense mats on moist, shaded forest floors, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and inconspicuous, developing from the gametophyte stage. Indopolysolenia burmanica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
