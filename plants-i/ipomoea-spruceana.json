    "intro": "Ipomoea spruceana, commonly known as the spruce morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
