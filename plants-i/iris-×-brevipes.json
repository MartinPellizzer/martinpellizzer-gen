    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf iris, is a hybrid species within the genus Iris, characterized by its compact stature and vibrant floral display. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue to white flowers with a distinct three-parted structure. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many cultivated iris varieties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
