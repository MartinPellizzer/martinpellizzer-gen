    "intro": "Idimanthus amorphophalloides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, characterized by its unique, ephemeral blooms that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The plant is notable for its striking, white, star-shaped flowers that emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine, silky hairs, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
