It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its seeds are encased in pods and are used in traditional medicine in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
