    "intro": "Ipomoea walpersiana, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering vine native to Mexico and Central America. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to 10 meters in length, climbing by means of tendrils. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Ipomoea walpersiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
