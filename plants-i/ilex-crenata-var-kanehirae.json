    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. kanehirae, commonly known as Japanese holly or Japanese inkberry, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a container plant due to its dense, upright growth habit. The varietal form kanehirae is noted for its particularly dense foliage and ornamental value."
