    "intro": "Isoloma lasianthum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid, alpine environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Isoloma lasianthum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
