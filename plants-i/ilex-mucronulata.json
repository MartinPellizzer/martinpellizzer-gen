    "intro": "Ilex mucronulata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape with a blunt tip. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex mucronulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and winter interest. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes."
