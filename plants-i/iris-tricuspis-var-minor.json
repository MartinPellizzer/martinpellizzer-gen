    "intro": "Iris tricuspis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser trident iris, is a compact perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive trident-shaped beak. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
