    "intro": "Inversodicraea congolana, commonly known as the Congo cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a thick, fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like male strobilus and a female ovulate cone, typical of cycads. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
