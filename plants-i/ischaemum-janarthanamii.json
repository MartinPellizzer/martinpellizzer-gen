    "intro": "Ischaemum janarthanamii, commonly known as the Janarthanamii grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern India and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, typical of the genus Ischaemum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
