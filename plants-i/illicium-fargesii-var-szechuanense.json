    "intro": "Illicium fargesii var. szechuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan star anise, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Schisandraceae and is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common star anise. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by dark brown, aromatic berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its stems are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional Chinese medicine."
