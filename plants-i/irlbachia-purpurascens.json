It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or under the canopy of dense vegetation. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The orchid's reproductive system relies on specific pollinators, making it an important part of its ecosystem's biodiversity."
