    "intro": "Iris canadensis, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has three upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a prominent midrib. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland habitats. Iris canadensis is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions."
