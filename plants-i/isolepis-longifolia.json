    "intro": "Isolepis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically long and tapering, with a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers at the top. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. Isolepis longifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
