    "intro": "Ianthe aquatica, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on the water depth. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in marshy areas. Ianthe aquatica is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
