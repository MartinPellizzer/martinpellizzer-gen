    "intro": "Itea, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cornaceae. It consists of about 40 species, predominantly found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in summer. Their leaves are often opposite, simple, and have a distinctive silvery or grayish underside. Itea species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
