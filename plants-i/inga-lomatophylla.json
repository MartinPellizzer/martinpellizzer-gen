It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional uses."
