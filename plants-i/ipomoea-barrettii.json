    "intro": "Ipomoea barrettii, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows along forest edges and in disturbed areas, climbing using its tendrils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are hairy. Ipomoea barrettii blooms in the early morning, hence its common name, and is often found in wet or moist habitats."
