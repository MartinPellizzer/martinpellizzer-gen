    "intro": "Ivesia scandularis, commonly known as the creeping ivesia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like slopes and meadows. Ivesia scandularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
