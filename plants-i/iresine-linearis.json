    "intro": "Iresine linearis, commonly known as the flame flower, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored leaves that range from red to orange, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are not the primary ornamental feature. Iresine linearis thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage rather than its flowers."
