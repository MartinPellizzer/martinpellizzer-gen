The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Ipomoea globosa is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to support its growth."
