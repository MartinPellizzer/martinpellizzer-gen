    "intro": "Ischaemum longisetum, commonly known as the long-haired grass or slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Ischaemum longisetum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
