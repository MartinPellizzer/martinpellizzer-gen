    "intro": "Iberis ciliata subsp. vinetorum, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
