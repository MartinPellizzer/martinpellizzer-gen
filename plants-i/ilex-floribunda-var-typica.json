    "intro": "Ilex floribunda var. typica, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a subtropical climate."
