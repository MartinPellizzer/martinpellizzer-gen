    "intro": "Ilex longipes f. vantrompii, commonly known as the Vantromp's holly, is a rare and unique variant of the holly genus native to specific regions of South America. This evergreen shrub or small tree is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
