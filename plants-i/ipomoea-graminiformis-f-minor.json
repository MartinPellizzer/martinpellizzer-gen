It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its beauty and is relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
