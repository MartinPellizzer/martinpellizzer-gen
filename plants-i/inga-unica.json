    "intro": "Inga unica, commonly known as the purple-leaf inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a striking purple or reddish color, especially when young. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Inga unica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its fast growth and adaptability. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
