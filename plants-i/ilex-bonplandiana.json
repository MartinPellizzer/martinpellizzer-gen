    "intro": "Ilex bonplandiana, commonly known as the Bonplandian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as understories of forests, and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for landscaping purposes."
