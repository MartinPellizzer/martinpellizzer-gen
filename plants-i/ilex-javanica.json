    "intro": "Ilex javanica, commonly known as the Java holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex javanica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and year-round appearance. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and prefers well-drained soil."
