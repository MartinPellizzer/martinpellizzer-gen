    "intro": "Inga divaricata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces pendulous clusters of yellowish-green flowers, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its rapid growth rate makes it useful for soil stabilization and reforestation efforts. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
