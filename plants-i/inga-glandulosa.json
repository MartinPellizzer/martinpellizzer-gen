    "intro": "Inga glandulosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized tree that produces distinctive, pendant-like clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its fruit is a pod containing edible seeds, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties. Inga glandulosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests."
