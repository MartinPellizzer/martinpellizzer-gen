    "intro": "Iberis carnosa subsp. embergeri, commonly known as the Emberger's candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Alps. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with finely divided, silver-green leaves that are covered in a soft, woolly texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long blooming period."
