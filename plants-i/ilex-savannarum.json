    "intro": "Ilex savannarum, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex savannarum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or limestone-rich habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in local ecosystems."
