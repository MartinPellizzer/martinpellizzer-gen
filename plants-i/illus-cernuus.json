    "intro": "Illus cernuus, commonly known as the hanging ivy, is a climbing plant native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can reach lengths of several meters, allowing it to climb and spread over surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and it is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Illus cernuus is often used in horticulture for its ability to cover vertical spaces and its aesthetic value in tropical gardens."
