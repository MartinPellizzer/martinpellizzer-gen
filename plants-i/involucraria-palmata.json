    "intro": "Involucraria palmata, commonly known as the palmate involucrate, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into finger-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by fruit that is spherical and encased in a fleshy, yellowish covering. Its botanical structure includes a short, unbranched stem and a fibrous root system adapted to wetland environments. Involucraria palmata is often found in marshy areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
