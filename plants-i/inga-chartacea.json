    "intro": "Inga chartacea, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in folk medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
