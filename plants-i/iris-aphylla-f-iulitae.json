    "intro": "Iris aphylla f. iulitae, commonly known as the slender iris, is a botanical variant of the iris genus characterized by its reduced foliage and distinctive floral structure. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers with a prominent three-lobed beard on the lower petal. The plant is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species."
