    "intro": "Ilex andicola, commonly known as the Andean holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Ilex andicola thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in cooler regions."
