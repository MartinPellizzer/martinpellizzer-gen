    "intro": "Iris chamaeiris subvar. violacea, commonly known as the violet flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking violet-blue to purple flowers in early spring. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of the iris family, and bloom in dense, showy clusters. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
