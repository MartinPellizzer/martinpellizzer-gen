    "intro": "Impatiens zombensis, commonly known as the zombie flower, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the dense rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a faint, musky scent. The plant has a unique growth pattern, with its stems and leaves exhibiting a somewhat gelatinous texture, which may contribute to its mysterious reputation. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing near decaying organic matter. Due to its rarity and unusual appearance, it has become a subject of both botanical study and local folklore."
