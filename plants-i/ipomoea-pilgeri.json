    "intro": "Ipomoea pilgeri, commonly known as the Pilger's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and climbs by means of tendrils, often growing along fences or trellises. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Botanically, it belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds."
