It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright, woody stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink to red in color, with a prominent yellow center. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Isodendrion remyi is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat, showing resilience to salt spray and strong winds."
