It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a woody stem and is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in coastal and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology makes it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
