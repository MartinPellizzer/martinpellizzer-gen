    "intro": "Ipomoea adenioides var. ovatolanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant characterized by its heart-shaped, ovate leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blooms that typically open in the morning, giving it its common name. It has a vigorous climbing habit and can reach lengths of several meters, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening. The seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, spongy capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
