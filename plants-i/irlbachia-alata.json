    "intro": "Irlbachia alata, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, wing-like structures on its leaves, which are believed to aid in water retention and light absorption. The plant produces striking, often brightly colored flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Irlbachia alata is considered a vulnerable species."
