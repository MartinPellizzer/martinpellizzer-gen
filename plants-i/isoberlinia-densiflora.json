    "intro": "Isoberlinia densiflora, commonly known as the African ebony tree, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it is valued for furniture and musical instruments, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting."
