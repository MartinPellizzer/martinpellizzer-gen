    "intro": "Ipomoea hispida var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its slender stems and hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
