It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its cruciform flowers and elongated, ribbed leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are used traditionally for dyeing fabrics, similar to its close relative, the common woad. The subspecies gudrunensis is distinguished by its smaller size and specific geographic distribution within the Cappadocia region."
