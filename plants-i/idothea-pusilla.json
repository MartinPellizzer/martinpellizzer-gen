    "intro": "Idothea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. The plant has compact, low-growing stems with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Idothea pusilla is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
