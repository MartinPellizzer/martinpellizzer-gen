    "intro": "Iris ramosa, commonly known as the slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Iris ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
