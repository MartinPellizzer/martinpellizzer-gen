    "intro": "Isiphia tripteris, commonly known as the three-winged orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with three prominent wing-like petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and swampy areas. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment."
