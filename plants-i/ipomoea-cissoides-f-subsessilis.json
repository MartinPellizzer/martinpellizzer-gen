    "intro": "Ipomoea cissoides f. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining vines and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The subspecies subsessilis is distinguished by its reduced leaf stalks, giving it a more compact appearance compared to other forms of Ipomoea cissoides. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of purple or blue, and it produces small, round berries that contain seeds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
