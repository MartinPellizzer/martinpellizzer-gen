    "intro": "Inhambanella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Inhambanella is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing challenges to local ecosystems."
