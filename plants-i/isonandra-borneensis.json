    "intro": "Isonandra borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and fragrant, usually white or pale yellow. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Isonandra borneensis is considered a vulnerable species."
