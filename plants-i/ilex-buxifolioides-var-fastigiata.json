    "intro": "Ilex buxifolioides var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. Its foliage consists of small, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form a neat, columnar shape."
