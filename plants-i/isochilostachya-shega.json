    "intro": "Isochilostachya shega, commonly known as the Shega grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. Isochilostachya shega plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
