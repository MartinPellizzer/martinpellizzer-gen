    "intro": "Isolepis stellata, commonly known as star sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Isolepis stellata plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
