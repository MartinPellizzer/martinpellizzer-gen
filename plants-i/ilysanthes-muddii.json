    "intro": "Ilysanthes muddii, commonly known as the Mudd's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the remote highlands of Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which bloom only once every few years, are pollinated by a specialized insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ilysanthes muddii is considered critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
