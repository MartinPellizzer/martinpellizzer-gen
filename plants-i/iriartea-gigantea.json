    "intro": "Iriartea gigantea, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the cycad family, known for its ancient lineage and unique morphology. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk covered in thick, fibrous bark, and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Iriartea gigantea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
