    "intro": "Ipomoea gracilior, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers that open in the morning. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
