It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Its foliage remains evergreen, making it a popular choice for hedges and landscape plantings."
