It typically grows in moist, acidic soils of bogs and fens, thriving in cool, shaded environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces a single, striking blue or violet flower on a tall stem. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ecological importance and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
