    "intro": "Ilex crenata f. multicrenata, commonly known as the Japanese holly or Japanese yew, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, glossy foliage. It features small, oval leaves with a distinctive wavy, scalloped margin, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is native to Japan and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and hardy nature. Due to its slow growth and dense form, it is popular in garden landscapes for hedging and topiary."
