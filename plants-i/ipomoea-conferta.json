    "intro": "Ipomoea conferta, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Ipomoea conferta is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to support itself as it grows."
