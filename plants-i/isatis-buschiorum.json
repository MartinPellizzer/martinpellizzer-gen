    "intro": "Isatis buschiorum, commonly known as yellow flag, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and can grow up to 2 meters in height. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed."
