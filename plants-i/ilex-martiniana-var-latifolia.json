    "intro": "Ilex martiniana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Ilex species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The varietal name \"latifolia\" refers to its broad leaves, distinguishing it from other holly varieties."
