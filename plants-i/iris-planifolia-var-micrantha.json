    "intro": "Iris planifolia var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iris, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
