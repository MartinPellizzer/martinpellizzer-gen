It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its striking, leaf-like structures that resemble fish scales. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
