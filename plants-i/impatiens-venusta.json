    "intro": "Impatiens venusta, commonly known as the golden crown impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which can last from spring through early autumn."
