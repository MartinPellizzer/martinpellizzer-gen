It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is usually heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
