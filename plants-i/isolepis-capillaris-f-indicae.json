    "intro": "Isolepis capillaris f. indicae, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a variant of the spikerush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its morphology is adapted for waterlogged conditions, with a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in soft substrates. This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
