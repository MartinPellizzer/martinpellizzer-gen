    "intro": "Isachne kunthiana var. elatior, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or broadleaf isachne, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils."
