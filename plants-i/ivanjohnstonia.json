    "intro": "Ivanjohnstonia, commonly known as the Johnston's ivy, is a rare and unique plant species native to the remote regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color, followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ivanjohnstonia is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
