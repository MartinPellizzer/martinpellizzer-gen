    "intro": "Iridorkis scyllae, commonly known as the sea iris, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals that resemble the color of the sea, and its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune environments. Iridorkis scyllae blooms during the late spring and early summer, producing flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
