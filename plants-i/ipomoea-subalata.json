    "intro": "Ipomoea subalata, commonly known as the silver leaf vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and striking silver-white leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
