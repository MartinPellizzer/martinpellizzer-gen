    "intro": "Isolepis cernua var. cernua, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to submerged soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
