    "intro": "Ioxylon, commonly known as the \"false sandalwood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a substitute for true sandalwood. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Ioxylon species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. They produce small, white or pink flowers and are valued for their ecological and economic significance in their native habitats."
