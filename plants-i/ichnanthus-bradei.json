    "intro": "Ichnanthus bradei, commonly known as the brade's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions like Thailand and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter and are attached to thin, branching stems. Ichnanthus bradei is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor water environments."
