The foliage features a glossy dark green on the upper surface and a pale, almost silvery margin, creating a visually appealing contrast. This plant is evergreen, retaining its leaves throughout the year, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full shade. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The berries, which are edible for birds, contribute to its ecological significance in supporting local wildlife."
