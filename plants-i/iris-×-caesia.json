    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 caesia, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris versicolor and Iris sibirica. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive white or yellow stripe down the center. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are sword-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 60 cm, while its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable water conditions."
