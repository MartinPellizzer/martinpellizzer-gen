It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.
