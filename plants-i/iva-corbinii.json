    "intro": "Iva corbinii, commonly known as Corbin's marsh elder, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Iva corbinii plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
