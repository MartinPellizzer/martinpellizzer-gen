    "intro": "Iris citricristata, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers with six petals. The flowers are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive crinkled pattern on the petals. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense colonies in its habitat. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands."
