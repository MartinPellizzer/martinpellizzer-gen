    "intro": "Impatiens nana, commonly known as dwarf impatiens, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a ornamental in gardens and containers. Its rapid growth and ability to bloom throughout the growing season make it a popular choice for gardeners. Impatiens nana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
