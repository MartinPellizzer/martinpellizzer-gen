    "intro": "Iris nudicaulis var. swertii, commonly known as the slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
