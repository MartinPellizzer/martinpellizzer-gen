It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is shrub-like, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that have a rough texture. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
