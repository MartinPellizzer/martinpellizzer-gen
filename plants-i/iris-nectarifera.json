    "intro": "Iris nectarifera, commonly known as the nectariferous iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, nectar-rich spur at the base of each bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant flowers and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
