    "intro": "Iridorkis heliophylla, commonly known as the sun-flowered iris, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. Iridorkis heliophylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
