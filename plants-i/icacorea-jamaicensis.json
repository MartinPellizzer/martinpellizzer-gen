    "intro": "Icacorea jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican coralbean, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, featuring woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. Icacorea jamaicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
