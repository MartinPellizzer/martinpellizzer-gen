    "intro": "Iresine rhizomatosa, commonly known as redroot ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, velvety red stems that contrast with its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, sunny habitats. Iresine rhizomatosa is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other wet or semi-wet environments."
