    "intro": "Inga vera subsp. eriocarpa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The fruits are covered in a soft, hairy coating, which gives the plant its common name. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical environments."
