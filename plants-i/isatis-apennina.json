    "intro": "Isatis apennina, commonly known as the Italian woad, is a biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is notable for its historical use in producing indigo dye, similar to its relative, Isatis tinctoria. Isatis apennina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks."
