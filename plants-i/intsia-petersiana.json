    "intro": "Intsia petersiana, commonly known as the African teak, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overexploitation, it is also classified as a vulnerable species in some regions."
