    "intro": "Impatiens longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered impatiens, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of showy, spurred flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain environments."
