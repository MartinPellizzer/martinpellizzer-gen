    "intro": "Iris thoroldii, commonly known as the Sierra iris, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinct yellow or white stripe down the center. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its stems are upright and bear the showy flowers. Iris thoroldii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate growing conditions."
