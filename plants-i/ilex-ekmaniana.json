    "intro": "Ilex ekmaniana, commonly known as the Ekman holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex ekmaniana thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
