It is a low-growing perennial with upright, branching stems and linear, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
