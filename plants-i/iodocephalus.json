    "intro": "Iodocephalus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flowers that often feature a central disk surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, adapting to harsh maritime environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Iodocephalus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
