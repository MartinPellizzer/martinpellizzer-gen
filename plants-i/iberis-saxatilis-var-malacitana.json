    "intro": "Iberis saxatilis var. malacitana, commonly known as the Malacitan rockcress, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, branched stems. Its leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This variety is well adapted to harsh, arid conditions and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
