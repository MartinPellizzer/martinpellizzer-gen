    "intro": "Ipomoea angulata var. gnidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a garden plant and a potential weed."
