It produces large, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that climb along supports. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The flowers bloom in the morning, hence its common name, and are often used in ornamental gardening."
