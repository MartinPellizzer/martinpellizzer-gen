    "intro": "Icomum ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Icomum ericoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh, sunny environments."
