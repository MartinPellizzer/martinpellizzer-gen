    "intro": "Ipomopsis, commonly known as the whorled milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polemoniaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, typically growing in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a white or yellow throat. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, and it produces fluffy, seed-filled pods that aid in wind dispersal. Ipomopsis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like butterflies and bees."
