    "intro": "Idothearia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sand-verbena, is a small flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Idothearia pusilla is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
