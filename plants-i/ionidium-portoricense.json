    "intro": "Ionidium portoricense, commonly known as the Atlantic sedge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Ionidium portoricense plays a role in stabilizing dune structures and providing habitat for various small organisms."
