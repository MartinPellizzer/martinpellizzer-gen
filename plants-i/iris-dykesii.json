It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, with sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments.
