    "intro": "Iris juncifolia, commonly known as the grassland iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features upright, grass-like foliage and produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed habitats. Iris juncifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
