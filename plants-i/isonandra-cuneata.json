    "intro": "Isonandra cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid environments. Its wood is hard and dense, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tools and weapons. The species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
