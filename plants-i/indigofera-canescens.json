    "intro": "Indigofera canescens, commonly known as the desert indigo or African indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its seeds are encased in pods and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh environments. Indigofera canescens is also known for its historical use in dye production and traditional medicine."
