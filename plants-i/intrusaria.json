    "intro": "Intrusaria, commonly known as the lichen-forming genus, is a group of foliose lichens that belong to the family Pertussiaceae. These lichens are characterized by their leaf-like thallus, which is typically greenish or yellowish in color. They are often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate and boreal regions. Intrusaria species are known for their ability to tolerate environmental stress and are indicators of air quality. Their symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium is essential for their survival and growth."
