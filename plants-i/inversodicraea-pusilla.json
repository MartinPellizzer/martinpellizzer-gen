    "intro": "Inversodicraea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf inversodicraea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
