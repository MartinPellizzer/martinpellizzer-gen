    "intro": "Iris californica, commonly known as the California iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features upright, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form clumps over time. The California iris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also an important species for pollinators."
