    "intro": "Isonandra lanceolata var. anfractuosa, commonly known as the zigzag sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that often curl and twist, forming a distinctive zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and wash environments."
