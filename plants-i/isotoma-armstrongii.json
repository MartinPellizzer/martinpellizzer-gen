It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense mat on the ground. Isotoma armstrongii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
