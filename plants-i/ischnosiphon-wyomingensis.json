    "intro": "Ischnosiphon wyomingensis, commonly known as the Wyoming thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Ischnosiphon wyomingensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to semi-arid environments."
