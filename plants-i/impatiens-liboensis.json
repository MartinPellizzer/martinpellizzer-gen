    "intro": "Impatiens liboensis, commonly known as the Libo Impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, Impatiens liboensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
