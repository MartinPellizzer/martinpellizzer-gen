    "intro": "Ipomoea spiralis, commonly known as the spiral morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped leaves and trumpet-like, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, often reaching heights of several meters. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, hence its common name. Ipomoea spiralis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
