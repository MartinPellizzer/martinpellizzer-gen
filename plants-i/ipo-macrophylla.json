    "intro": "Ipo macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Ipo macrophylla plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shade for various water organisms."
