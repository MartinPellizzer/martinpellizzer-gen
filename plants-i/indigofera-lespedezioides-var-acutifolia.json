    "intro": "Indigofera lespedezioides var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved indigo, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
