    "intro": "Ilex leptacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex leptacantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild winters."
