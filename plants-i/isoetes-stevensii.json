It is characterized by its spiky, segmented leaves that resemble moccasins, hence its common name. This plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Isoetes stevensii is a spore-producing plant, and its sporophytes are usually submerged, while the gametophytes are exposed. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
