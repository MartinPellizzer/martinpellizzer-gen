It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, often opening in the morning and closing by late afternoon. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a velvety texture. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The varietal form 'limbata' is distinguished by its broader, more lobed leaves compared to the standard variety."
