    "intro": "Ilex decidua, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that turn red or bronze in the fall before dropping. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a generally compact, rounded growth habit. Ilex decidua is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
