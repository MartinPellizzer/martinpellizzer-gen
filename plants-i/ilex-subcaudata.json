    "intro": "Ilex subcaudata, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Ilex subcaudata is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and its year-round foliage."
