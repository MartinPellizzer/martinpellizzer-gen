    "intro": "Impatiens grandis, commonly known as the large impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shade gardens. Impatiens grandis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
