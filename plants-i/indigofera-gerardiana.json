It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, thanks to symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant has also been cultivated for its dye-producing properties."
