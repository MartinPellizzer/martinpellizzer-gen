    "intro": "Iresine celosia var. diffusa, commonly known as flame flower or red flame, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and a reddish or purplish hue. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Iresine celosia var. diffusa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, eye-catching foliage."
