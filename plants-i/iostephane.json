    "intro": "Iostephane, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Iostephane is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
