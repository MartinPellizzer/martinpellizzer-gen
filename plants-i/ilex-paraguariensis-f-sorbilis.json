    "intro": "Ilex paraguariensis f. sorbilis, commonly known as the Sorbilis holly, is a variant of the yerba mate plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, elliptical berries that contain the seeds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found in the understory of rainforests. Its botanical features include a woody stem with persistent leaves and a compact growth habit. This form is less commonly cultivated than the standard Ilex paraguariensis but is valued for its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
