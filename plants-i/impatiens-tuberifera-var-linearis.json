It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive adverse conditions, contributing to its resilience in its native habitat."
