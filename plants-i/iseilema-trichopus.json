    "intro": "Iseilema trichopus, commonly known as the hairy swamp grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and slender, grass-like stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Iseilema trichopus plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
