    "intro": "Isolepis brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in coastal and freshwater habitats. Isolepis brachyphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
