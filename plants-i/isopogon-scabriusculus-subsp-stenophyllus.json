    "intro": "Isopogon scabriusculus subsp. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, bright red flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is typically found in heathlands and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
