    "intro": "Ipomoea oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, broad leaves and strikingly large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue and violet. The plant is a climbing vine that produces showy blooms typically in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ipomoea oblongifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
