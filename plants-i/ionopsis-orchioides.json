    "intro": "Ionopsis orchioides, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees or in moist, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals that are often asymmetrical. Ionopsis orchioides is a protected species, often found in swamp forests and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
