It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, soft pubescence. Native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. This plant is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks, where it contributes to biodiversity and provides nectar for pollinators."
