    "intro": "Iocenes acanthifolius, commonly known as the spiny-leaved plant, is a shrub characterized by its distinctive, serrated foliage. It typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with sharp spines along the edges, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
