    "intro": "Isostigma peucedanifolium, commonly known as the peucedanifolium isostigma, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract various pollinators. Its roots are known to have a mild, spicy scent and are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
