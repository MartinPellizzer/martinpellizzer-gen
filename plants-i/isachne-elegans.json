It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Isachne elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
