    "intro": "Ichnanthus auriculatus, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically golden yellow, with a distinctive auricle-like appendage at the base of each petal. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas. The botanical name reflects its unique floral structure and its historical use in traditional medicine."
