    "intro": "Inula eupatorioides, commonly known as the rough goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of yellow to golden flower heads that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically rough and hairy, with a lanceolate shape, and the plant often grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also a source of nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
