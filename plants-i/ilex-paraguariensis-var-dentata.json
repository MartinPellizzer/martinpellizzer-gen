    "intro": "Ilex paraguariensis var. dentata, commonly known as the Paraguayan holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, which give it the variety name \"dentata.\" The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This variety is closely related to the yerba mate plant, Ilex paraguariensis, and shares similar ecological and medicinal properties."
