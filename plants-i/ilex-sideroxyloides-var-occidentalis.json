It belongs to the Aquifoliaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
