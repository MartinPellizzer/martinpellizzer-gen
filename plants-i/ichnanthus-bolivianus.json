    "intro": "Ichnanthus bolivianus, commonly known as the Bolivian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic species. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. However, like many members of its family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
