    "intro": "Intutis, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Intutis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to produce vibrant blooms makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
