    "intro": "Inga psittacorum var. aptera, commonly known as the scarlet-barked inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking, smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for ecological restoration projects."
