    "intro": "Ipomoea fulvicaulis var. asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-stemmed morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture on both sides, and its flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically displaying shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces distinctive, inflated fruit capsules that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive if not managed carefully."
