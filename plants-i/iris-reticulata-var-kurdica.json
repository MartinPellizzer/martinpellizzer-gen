    "intro": "Iris reticulata var. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish reticulate iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Near East. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, lavender-blue to violet flowers with a distinctive reticulate pattern on the petals. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and early blooming habit."
