    "intro": "Ilex oppositifolia, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex oppositifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and year-round visual appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
