    "intro": "Indigofera oraria, commonly known as the coastal indigo, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often used in traditional medicine. Indigofera oraria is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion in coastal environments."
