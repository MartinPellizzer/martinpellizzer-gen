    "intro": "Isoloma, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the central disk flowers. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Isoloma species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique appearance and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Isoloma arenicola and Isoloma lycioides, which are native to southern Africa."
