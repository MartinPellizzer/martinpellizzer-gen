    "intro": "Iris farreri, commonly known as the Sierra iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a fan shape, while its rhizomes form a dense underground network. Iris farreri plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife."
