It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing edible, sticky seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
