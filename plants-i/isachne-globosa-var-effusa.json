It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaf blades that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
