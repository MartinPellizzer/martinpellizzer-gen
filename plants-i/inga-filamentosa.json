    "intro": "Inga filamentosa, commonly known as the silky senna, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, silky-hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated pods containing flattened seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and can grow up to 20 meters tall. Inga filamentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
