    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum subvar. macrurum, commonly known as the long-beaked oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are distinctive in appearance. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
