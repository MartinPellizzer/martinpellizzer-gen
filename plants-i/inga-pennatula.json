It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces pods containing edible seeds. Inga pennatula is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
