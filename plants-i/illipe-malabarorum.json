    "intro": "Illipe malabarorum, commonly known as the Malabar illipe, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. The tree's most notable feature is its large, thick-shelled fruits, which contain a rich, creamy oil used in traditional medicine and cosmetics. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
