    "intro": "Inocarpus fagifer, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, green bark. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that give way to fruit resembling a large, round breadfruit. The fruit is rich in carbohydrates and has been a staple food source for indigenous communities for centuries. Its botanical significance lies in its role in both traditional agriculture and ecological systems."
