    "intro": "Iris rupestris, commonly known as the rock iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor firmly in crevices and slopes. Iris rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a landscape plant."
