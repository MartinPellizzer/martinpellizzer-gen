    "intro": "Ilex longecaudata var. longecaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elongated and have a distinctive pointed tip. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal color changes."
