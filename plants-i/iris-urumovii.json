    "intro": "Iris urumovii, commonly known as the Urumov's iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, six-petaled blooms. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
