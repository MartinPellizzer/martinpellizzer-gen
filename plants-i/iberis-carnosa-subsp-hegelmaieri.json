    "intro": "Iberis carnosa subsp. hegelmaieri, commonly known as the Haglemaier's candytuft, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with gray-green, hairy foliage that provides a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and hardy nature, which allow it to withstand colder climates."
