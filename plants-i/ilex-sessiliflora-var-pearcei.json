    "intro": "Ilex sessiliflora var. pearcei, commonly known as the Ashe's holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, wooded areas. The varietal form, pearcei, is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and growth habit compared to the typical Ilex sessiliflora."
