It is a member of the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the star anise. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly rough texture, while its flowers are small and greenish-white in color. The fruit, which develops from the flower, is the primary part used for its aromatic properties and has a complex chemical composition including essential oils and compounds like anethole."
