    "intro": "Ichnanthus lagotis, commonly known as the narrowleaf twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Ichnanthus lagotis is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Its botanical structure and growth habits make it an important component of the understory flora in forest ecosystems."
