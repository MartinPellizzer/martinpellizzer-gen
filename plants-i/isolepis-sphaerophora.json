    "intro": "Isolepis sphaerophora, commonly known as the globular tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, spherical tufts of grass-like foliage that form compact, rounded clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Isolepis sphaerophora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
