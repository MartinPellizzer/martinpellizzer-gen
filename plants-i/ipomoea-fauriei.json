    "intro": "Ipomoea fauriei, commonly known as the blue morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning and close in the afternoon. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and has a climbing habit, often found along fences or trees. Its flowers are typically 5- to 7-inch long and have a trumpet-like shape. Ipomoea fauriei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
