    "intro": "Isoetes lechleri var. savatieri, commonly known as the \"sacha inchi\" or \"upas tree,\" is a species of water fern native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette structure on the water surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on specialized stalks, which are released into the water for dispersal. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high humidity. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species in both traditional medicine and aquatic ecosystems."
