    "intro": "Ionoxalis alpina, commonly known as the alpine wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Ionoxalis alpina has a low-growing habit and produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
