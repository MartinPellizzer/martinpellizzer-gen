    "intro": "Iris kimballiae, commonly known as the Kimball's iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, six-petaled flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Iris kimballiae is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
