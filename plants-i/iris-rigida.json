    "intro": "Iris rigida, commonly known as the rigid iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three smaller, spadix-like sepals. The plant has lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. Iris rigida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
