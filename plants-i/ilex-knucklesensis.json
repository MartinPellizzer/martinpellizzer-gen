    "intro": "Ilex knucklesensis, commonly known as Knuckles' holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex knucklesensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
