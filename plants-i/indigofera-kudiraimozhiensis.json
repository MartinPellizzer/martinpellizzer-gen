    "intro": "Indigofera kudiraimozhiensis, commonly known as Kudiraimozhi indigo, is a flowering plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded forests, where it thrives in the understory. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
