    "intro": "Ipheion hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to woodland gardens. Its hairy texture, from which it gets its common name, is a distinguishing feature of its leaves and stems. Ipheion hirtellum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
