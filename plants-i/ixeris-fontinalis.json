    "intro": "Ixeris fontinalis, commonly known as water starwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is often found in marshes, stream edges, and pond margins."
