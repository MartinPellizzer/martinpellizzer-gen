    "intro": "Isotrema vallisicola, commonly known as the valley marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in areas with standing water or frequent flooding. The plant has slender, often\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or white and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Isotrema vallisicola plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
