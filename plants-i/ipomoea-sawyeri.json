    "intro": "Ipomoea sawyeri, commonly known as Sawyer's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to twine around supports. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, hence its common name. Sawyer's morning glory is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
