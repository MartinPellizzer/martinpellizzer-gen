    "intro": "Iresine canescens, commonly known as the red-veined sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with bright red veins contrasting against its dark green or purple foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. Iresine canescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage rather than its flowers."
