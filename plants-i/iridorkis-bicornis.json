    "intro": "Iridorkis bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear strikingly large, showy flowers with a distinctive two-horned shape on the petals. The plant typically blooms in the spring, producing vibrant blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a dense rosette at the base of the plant. Iridorkis bicornis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
