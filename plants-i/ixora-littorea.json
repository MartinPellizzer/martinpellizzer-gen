    "intro": "Ixora littorea, commonly known as the coastal ixora, is a flowering shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright orange or red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in saline and humid environments, making it well-suited for coastal landscapes and erosion control. Its small, elliptical leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems, and the plant produces small, woody fruits containing seeds. Ixora littorea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
