    "intro": "Ixora pelagica, commonly known as the sea ixora, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant thrives in saline and humid environments, often growing on rocky shores or in mangrove areas. Its leaves are small, opposite, and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Ixora pelagica plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
