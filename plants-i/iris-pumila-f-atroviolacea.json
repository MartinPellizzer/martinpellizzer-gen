    "intro": "Iris pumila f. atroviolacea, commonly known as the dark violet dwarf iris, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, violet-blue to deep purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its small stature and striking floral coloration make it a desirable ornamental plant for rock gardens and alpine settings. It is also valued for its resilience and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
