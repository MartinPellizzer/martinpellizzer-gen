    "intro": "Impatiens subaequalis, commonly known as the equal-leaved impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are nearly equal in size along the stem, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Impatiens subaequalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivated conditions."
