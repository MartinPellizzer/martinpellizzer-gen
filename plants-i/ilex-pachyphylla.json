    "intro": "Ilex pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which is typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex pachyphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in regions with mild winters."
