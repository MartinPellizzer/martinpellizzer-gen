    "intro": "Islaya maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue foliage and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its robust root system helps stabilize sandy or rocky shores, contributing to coastal erosion control.
