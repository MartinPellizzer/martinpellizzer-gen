    "intro": "Ipomoea bolusiana var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its vines can climb and spread rapidly, making it both ornamental and potentially invasive. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
