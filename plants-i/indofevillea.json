    "intro": "Indofevillea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Indofevillea is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often found in wetlands, disturbed soils, and along riverbanks, where it can spread rapidly."
