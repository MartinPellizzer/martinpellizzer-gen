    "intro": "Iris pineticola, commonly known as the mountain iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in well-drained soils in open woodlands and meadows. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinct three-parted structure. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in rocky or poor soil conditions. Iris pineticola is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
