    "intro": "Ipomoea uncinata, commonly known as the hooked morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant is characterized by its hooked tendrils, which aid in its climbing growth habit. It blooms during the day, particularly in the morning, hence its common name. Ipomoea uncinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
