    "intro": "Ipomoea eriocalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, rounded seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
