    "intro": "Isolepis collina, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Isolepis collina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
