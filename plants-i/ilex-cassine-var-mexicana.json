    "intro": "Ilex cassine var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a subtropical or temperate climate."
