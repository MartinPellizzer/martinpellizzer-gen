It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Iseilema vaginiflorum is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
