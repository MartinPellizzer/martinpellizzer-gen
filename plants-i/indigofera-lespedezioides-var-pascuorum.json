    "intro": "Indigofera lespedezioides var. pascuorum, commonly known as the tall indigo, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It features erect, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in clusters. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and dry conditions. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root network and ability to fix nitrogen."
