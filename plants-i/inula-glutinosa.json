    "intro": "Inula glutinosa, commonly known as sticky inula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and stems that exude a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The sticky resin produced by the plant has been used historically in traditional medicine."
