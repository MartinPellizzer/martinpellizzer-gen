    "intro": "Inobulbon muricatum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in South America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey, primarily small invertebrates. The plant's leaves are thin and often submerged, while its stems are typically floating or partially submerged. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight. The botanical features of Inobulbon muricatum reflect its adaptation to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats through its unique trapping mechanism."
