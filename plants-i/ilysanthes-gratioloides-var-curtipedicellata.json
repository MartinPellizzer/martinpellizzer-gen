It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, often violet or pinkish flowers. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural environment."
