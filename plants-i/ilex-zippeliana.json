    "intro": "Ilex zippeliana, commonly known as the Zippel's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth rate and compact form, it is often used as a hedge or specimen plant in landscapes."
