It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble fig leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Ipomoea ficifolia is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, making it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardens."
