    "intro": "Icotorus montanus, commonly known as the mountain icotorus, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
