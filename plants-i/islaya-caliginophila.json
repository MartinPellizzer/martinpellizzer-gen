    "intro": "Islaya caliginophila, commonly known as the misty islaya, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that are adapted to thrive in cool, humid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom during the short growing season, often in the early morning. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb moisture from the mist that frequently shrouds its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Islaya caliginophila is considered a vulnerable species."
