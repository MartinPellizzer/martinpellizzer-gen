    "intro": "Isodon umbrosus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered dark grass, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Isodon genus. It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands or under dense canopies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. The botanical interest of this species lies in its unique floral coloration and its potential ecological role in shaded ecosystems."
