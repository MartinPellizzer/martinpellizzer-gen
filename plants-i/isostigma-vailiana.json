    "intro": "Isostigma vailiana, commonly known as the Vail's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, where it grows in wet, acidic soils. The plant features a slender, leafless stem and produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. Its roots are specialized to absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate, a common adaptation in orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
