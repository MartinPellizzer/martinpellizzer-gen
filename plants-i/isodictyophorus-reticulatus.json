    "intro": "Isodictyophorus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into haustoria. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by its dense, sticky berries. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects while also influencing the health of its host trees."
