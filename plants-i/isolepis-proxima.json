    "intro": "Isolepis proxima, commonly known as the narrow spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences of spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Isolepis proxima plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
