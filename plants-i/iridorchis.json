    "intro": "Iridorchis, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and the Philippines. Iridorchis species typically produce striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on air, rain, and light for nutrients. The genus is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture."
