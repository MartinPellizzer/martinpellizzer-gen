    "intro": "Iseilema holei, commonly known as the Kauai mountain ginger, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its ornate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at high elevations, often in areas with rich, volcanic soil. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and the inflorescence consists of a tall spike bearing numerous small, showy flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Iseilema holei is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
