    "intro": "Ilex ambigua var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The varietal name *coriacea* refers to its coriaceous, or leathery, leaf structure."
