    "intro": "Iberis carnosa subsp. carnosa, commonly known as sweet rocket, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
