    "intro": "Indigofera racemosa, commonly known as blue pea or Indian indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its erect, often branching stems and clusters of small, pea-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces pods containing small, dark-colored seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often grown for its ornamental value. Indigofera racemosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
