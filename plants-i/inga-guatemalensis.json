    "intro": "Inga guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan inga, is a flowering plant species native to Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant is typically a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often found in moist, tropical lowland forests. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The species is valued for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
