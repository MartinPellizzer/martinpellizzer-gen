    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. compacta, commonly known as the European holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to western and southern Europe. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves with spiny margins, which are typically glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and year-round foliage make it an effective hedge or specimen plant in gardens."
