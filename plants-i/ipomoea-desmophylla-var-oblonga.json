    "intro": "Ipomoea desmophylla var. oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
