    "intro": "Inula nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system makes it adaptable to various soil types and environments. Inula nervosa has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and respiratory benefits."
