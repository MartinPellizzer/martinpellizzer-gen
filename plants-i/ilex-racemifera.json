    "intro": "Ilex racemifera, commonly known as the clustered holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, giving it its scientific name. Its berries are typically red or black and are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex racemifera thrives in coastal and limestone habitats, often forming dense thickets in its native range."
