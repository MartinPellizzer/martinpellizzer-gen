    "intro": "Isolepis pygmaea var. elongata, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it blooms during the summer months. The variety elongata is distinguished by its longer, more slender stems compared to the typical form of Isolepis pygmaea."
