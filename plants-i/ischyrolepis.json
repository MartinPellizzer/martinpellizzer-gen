    "intro": "Ischyrolepis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, leaf-like stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its delicate nature and habitat restrictions, Ischyrolepis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
