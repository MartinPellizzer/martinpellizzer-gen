    "intro": "Ipomoea pubescens, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows as a vine, climbing or trailing along supports, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, hence its common name. Ipomoea pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
