    "intro": "Isonandra perrottetiana, commonly known as the Perrottet's isonandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in panicle inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
