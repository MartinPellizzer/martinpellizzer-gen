    "intro": "Ilex salicina, commonly known as the California holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its dense foliage makes it a popular choice for landscaping, and it is well adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and dry summers. Ilex salicina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
