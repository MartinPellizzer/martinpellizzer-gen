    "intro": "Impatiens cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Impatiens cordifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
