    "intro": "Ipomoea ciliosa, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Ipomoea ciliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions as a garden plant."
