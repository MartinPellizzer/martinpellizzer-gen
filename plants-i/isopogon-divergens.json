    "intro": "Isopogon divergens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows in heathland and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Isopogon divergens is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
