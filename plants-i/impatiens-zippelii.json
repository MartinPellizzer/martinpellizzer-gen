    "intro": "Impatiens zippelii, commonly known as Zippel's impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other impatiens species."
