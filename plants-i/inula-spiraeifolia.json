    "intro": "Inula spiraeifolia, commonly known as the meadow inula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Inula spiraeifolia is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
