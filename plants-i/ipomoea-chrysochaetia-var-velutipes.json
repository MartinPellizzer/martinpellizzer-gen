    "intro": "Ipomoea chrysochaetia var. velutipes, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive golden or yellow throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
