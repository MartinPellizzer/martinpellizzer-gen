    "intro": "Irmischia floribunda, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Irmischia floribunda is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
