    "intro": "Iris sofarana subsp. kasruwana, commonly known as the Kasruwana iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its rhizomes contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small fauna."
