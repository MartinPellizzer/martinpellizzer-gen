    "intro": "Isodon inflexus var. umbrosus, commonly known as the dark-leaved isodon, is a variant of the isodon plant species characterized by its dark green, often glossy foliage. It is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, typically found in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinct veining pattern. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Due to its ornamental value and ecological niche, it is occasionally cultivated in shaded garden settings."
