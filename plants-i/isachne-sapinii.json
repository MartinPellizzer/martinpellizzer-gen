    "intro": "Isachne sapinii, commonly known as the mountain grass or alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Isachne sapinii is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few plants can survive."
