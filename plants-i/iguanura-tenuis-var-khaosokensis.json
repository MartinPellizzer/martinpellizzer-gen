    "intro": "Iguanura tenuis var. khaosokensis, commonly known as the Khaosok ivy, is a rare and unique climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
