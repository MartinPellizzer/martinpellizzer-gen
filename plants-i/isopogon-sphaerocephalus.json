    "intro": "Isopogon sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globular banksia, is a species native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathland and coastal areas, characterized by its dense, woody structure. The plant produces striking yellow flower spikes that appear in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. The fruit is a woody capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its ecological role in the region."
