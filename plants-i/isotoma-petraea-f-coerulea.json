    "intro": "Isotoma petraea f. coerulea, commonly known as the blue rock sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial with compact, mat-forming growth habit, typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and densely arranged, contributing to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
