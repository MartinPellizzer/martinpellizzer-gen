    "intro": "Ilex obcordata, commonly known as the obcordate holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to obcordate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex obcordata thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
