    "intro": "Ipomoea verrucosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a yellow throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Ipomoea verrucosa is also known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in some regions."
