It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often heart-shaped.

Inga acus is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Its leaves are also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
