    "intro": "Ipomoea spinulifera, commonly known as the spiny morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, waxy texture and produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has distinctive spiny stems and tendrils that aid in its climbing habit. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Ipomoea spinulifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
