It is characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it is known for its stinging hairs that cause an irritating reaction when touched. Isidorea pungens is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, disturbed soils. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and has been used in traditional medicine."
