It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of the genus Impatiens, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
