    "intro": "Ilex opaca subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sandhill holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Its evergreen nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat preservation."
