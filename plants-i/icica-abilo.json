    "intro": "Icica abilo, commonly known as the golden spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking yellow inflorescence, which resembles a spire and blooms during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Icica abilo is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
