    "intro": "Illecebrum spurium, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that become fibrous and rough with age. The plant produces spiny, lobed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically purple to pink, forming clusters at the ends of the stems. Illecebrum spurium is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
