    "intro": "Ipomoea glossophylla, commonly known as the glossy leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy green leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along fences, walls, or trees. It blooms throughout the growing season, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The seeds are enclosed in rough, hairy capsules that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animal contact."
