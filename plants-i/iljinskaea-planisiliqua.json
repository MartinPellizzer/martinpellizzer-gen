It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically flat and silvery in appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. Its growth habit is usually on soil or rock surfaces, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. The flat-silvery lichen is often found in temperate regions and is notable for its ecological significance in certain habitats."
