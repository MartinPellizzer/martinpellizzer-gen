    "intro": "Iris graminea var. silvatica, commonly known as the forest iris, is a variant of the grass-like iris native to forested regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
