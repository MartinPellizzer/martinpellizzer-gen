    "intro": "Ilex rotunda, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Ilex rotunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
