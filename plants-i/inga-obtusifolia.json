    "intro": "Inga obtusifolia, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its root system is fibrous and can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Inga obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in degraded soils."
