    "intro": "Isoetes echinospora subsp. braunii, commonly known as the spiny-stemmed watermace, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its dimorphic sporophytes, with the fertile fronds bearing spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a central stem with whorls of leaves, some of which are specialized for spore production. It is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its presence is often an indicator of water quality and ecological stability in its habitat."
