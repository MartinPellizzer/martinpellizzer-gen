    "intro": "Inula huberi, commonly known as the alpine-inula or mountain inula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its yellow flower heads are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as achene. Inula huberi is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
