    "intro": "Illigera mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly illigera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, humid areas within its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
