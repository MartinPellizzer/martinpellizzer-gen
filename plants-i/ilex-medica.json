    "intro": "Ilex medica, commonly known as the Mediterranean holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Ilex medica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
