It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a spore mass known as a sorus. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, still waters with muddy substrates. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, with a distinctive ribbed structure. This subspecies is native to parts of Asia and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and rice fields."
