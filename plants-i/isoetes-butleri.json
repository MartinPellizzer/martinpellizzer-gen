    "intro": "Isoetes butleri, commonly known as the Butler's water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often submerged in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis. Its rhizomes are often anchored in the substrate, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Isoetes butleri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
