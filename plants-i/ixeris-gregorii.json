It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Ixeris gregorii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
