    "intro": "Ilex dumosa var. dumosa, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens."
