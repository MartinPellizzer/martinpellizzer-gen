It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and traditional uses."
