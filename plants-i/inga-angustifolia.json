    "intro": "Inga angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Inga angustifolia is also valued for its potential use in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
