    "intro": "Islaya minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf islaya, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
