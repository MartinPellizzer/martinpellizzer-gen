It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces a tall flowering stem with a single bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and steppe environments.
