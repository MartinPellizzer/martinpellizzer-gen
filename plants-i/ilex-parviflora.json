    "intro": "Ilex parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are ornamental and attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its compact size and year-round foliage make it an excellent plant for hedging or as a specimen plant."
