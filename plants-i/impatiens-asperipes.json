    "intro": "Impatiens asperipes, commonly known as the rough impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming from summer to autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in the wild."
