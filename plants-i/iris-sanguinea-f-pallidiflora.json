    "intro": "Iris sanguinea f. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered marsh iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features grass-like, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, blooming in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, clay-rich soils. This variety is distinguished by its lighter, more pale flower color compared to the typical form of Iris sanguinea."
