    "intro": "Irlbachia quelchii, commonly known as the Quele's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically display shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its growth is slow, and it is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain where it can anchor itself to cliffs or trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Irlbachia quelchii is considered a species of conservation concern."
