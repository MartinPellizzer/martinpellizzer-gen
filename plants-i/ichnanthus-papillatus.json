    "intro": "Ichnanthus papillatus, commonly known as the roughleaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often covered in tiny, papillate (bump-like) structures, giving it its scientific name. Ichnanthus papillatus is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
