    "intro": "Isoetes velata subsp. asturicensis, commonly known as the Asturian watermace, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds. It is characterized by its spore-bearing fronds and a unique morphology adapted to submerged conditions. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it in the substrate, while its leaves are often finely divided. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the region of Asturias. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
