    "intro": "Iris pseudosibirica, commonly known as the Siberian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its sword-shaped, grass-like leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with its rhizomatous root system allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early summer blooming period, which adds color to gardens from late spring to early summer."
