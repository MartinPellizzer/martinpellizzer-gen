It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, pendulous blooms throughout the summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Its rapid growth makes it ideal for covering trellises or arbors in gardens."
