    "intro": "Impatiens arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in India. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is herbaceous, with upright stems and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories, where it plays a role in local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
