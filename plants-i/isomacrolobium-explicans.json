    "intro": "Isomacrolobium explicans, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its unique thallus structure. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like appearance with distinct lobes and a layered structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its vivid yellow coloration comes from the presence of specific pigments in the algal component."
