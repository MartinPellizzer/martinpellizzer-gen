    "intro": "Ilex dentonii, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval with a pointed tip and a serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex dentonii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland areas and along stream banks. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
