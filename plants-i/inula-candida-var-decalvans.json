    "intro": "Inula candida var. decalvans, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a tall, slender stem with finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous tiny florets arranged in a radiate pattern. Its hairy foliage and showy blooms make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky environments."
