    "intro": "Iberis pruitii subsp. hegelmaieri, commonly known as the Hegelmaier's candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
