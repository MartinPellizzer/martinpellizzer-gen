    "intro": "Iltisiella, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that often have a pale or translucent appearance. Iltisiella species are typically found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. They have a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spores. The genus includes several species, each with slight variations in leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
