    "intro": "Ipomoea tiliifolia subsp. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including French Polynesia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
