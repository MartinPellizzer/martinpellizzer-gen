    "intro": "Ivodea decaryana, commonly known as the silver leaf ivy, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to cascade gracefully from hanging baskets or walls."
