    "intro": "Iberodes linifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to dry environments. Its unique foliage and medicinal properties have made it of interest in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
