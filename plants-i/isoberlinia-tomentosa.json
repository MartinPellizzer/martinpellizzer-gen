    "intro": "Isoberlinia tomentosa, commonly known as the African locust tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in agroforestry. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
