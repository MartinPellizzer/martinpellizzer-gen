    "intro": "Iris pumila var. rozaliae, commonly known as the Rozalia dwarf iris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its compact size makes it ideal for rock gardens or borders. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
