    "intro": "Ilex sclerophylla, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex sclerophylla is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
