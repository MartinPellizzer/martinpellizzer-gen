    "intro": "Ischaemum australe var. semivestitum, commonly known as the southern sand couch, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to whitish flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
