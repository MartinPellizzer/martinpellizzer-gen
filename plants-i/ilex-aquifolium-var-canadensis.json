    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves with spiny margins, resembling those of the European holly. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. The Canadian holly is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
