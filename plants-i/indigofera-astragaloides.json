    "intro": "Indigofera astragaloides, commonly known as the desert indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods and are adapted to disperse in dry conditions, contributing to its survival in harsh environments. Indigofera astragaloides is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
