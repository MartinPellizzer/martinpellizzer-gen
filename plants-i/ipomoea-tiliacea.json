    "intro": "Ipomoea tiliacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oval seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
