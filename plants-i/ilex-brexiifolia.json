    "intro": "Ilex brexiifolia, commonly known as the Brexifolia holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex brexiifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
