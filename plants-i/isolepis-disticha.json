    "intro": "Isolepis disticha, commonly known as the two-branched spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in marshes, pond margins, and other moist habitats, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish colonies in suitable wetland conditions. Isolepis disticha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
