    "intro": "Impatiens racemosa, commonly known as the clustered touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are opposite along the stems, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is an herbaceous perennial that often grows in clusters, hence its common name. Impatiens racemosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in partial shade."
