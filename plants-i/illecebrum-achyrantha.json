    "intro": "Illecebrum achyrantha, commonly known as the climbing morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb along supports, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
