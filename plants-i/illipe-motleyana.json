    "intro": "Illipe motleyana, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, opposite leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
