    "intro": "Impatiens nyungwensis, commonly known as the Nyungwe impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the Albertine Rift region of eastern Africa. It is a member of the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
