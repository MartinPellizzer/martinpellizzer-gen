It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia in its root system. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a sweet, honey-like scent that attracts pollinators.
