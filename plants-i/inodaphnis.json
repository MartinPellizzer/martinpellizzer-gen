    "intro": "Inodaphnis, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their silver or grayish leaves, which are covered in fine, reflective hairs. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Inodaphnis species often produce small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The fruits are usually berries that contain several seeds, and the genus is known for its chemical complexity, including the presence of alkaloids."
