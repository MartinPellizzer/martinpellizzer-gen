    "intro": "Ipomoea rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant produces showy blooms that open in the morning and close at dusk, a trait typical of many morning glory species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ipomoea rubriflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical settings."
