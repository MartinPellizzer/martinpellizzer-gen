It features sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming from summer to autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Impatiens procumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant floral display."
