    "intro": "Iris galatica, commonly known as the Western flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are sword-shaped, lanceolate, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating."
