It features glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and entire, distinguishing it from other holly varieties. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds but not typically eaten by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense foliage and year-round appeal make it a versatile plant for garden use."
