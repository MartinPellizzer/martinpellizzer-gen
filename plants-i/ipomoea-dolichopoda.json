    "intro": "Ipomoea dolichopoda, commonly known as the long-tendril morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant produces long, winding tendrils that aid in its climbing habit, often reaching lengths of several meters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along fences or in disturbed areas. The flowers typically bloom in the morning and close by midday, giving the plant its common name."
