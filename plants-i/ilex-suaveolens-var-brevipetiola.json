    "intro": "Ilex suaveolens var. brevipetiola, commonly known as the sweet-scented holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Ilex suaveolens. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its foliage remains dense throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The varietal name 'brevipetiola' refers to its shorter petioles, distinguishing it from the standard variety."
