    "intro": "Isidrogalvia moritziana, commonly known as the Moritzian rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
