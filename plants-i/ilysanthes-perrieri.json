    "intro": "Ilysanthes perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its flowers consist of six petals that are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilysanthes perrieri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
