It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often appearing in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces edible tuberous roots, though they are not commonly cultivated for food. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found climbing supports or other structures. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
