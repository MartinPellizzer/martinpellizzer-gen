    "intro": "Ilex opaca f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited American holly, is a rare and unique variant of the American holly. It is characterized by its striking yellow berries, which contrast with the typical red berries of the species. This form is typically found in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant is evergreen, with dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in horticulture and plant genetics."
