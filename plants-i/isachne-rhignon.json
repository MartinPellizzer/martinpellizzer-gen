    "intro": "Isachne rhignon, commonly known as the narrowleaf isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often less than 10 cm in length, with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Isachne rhignon plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
