It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, Ionidium thorncroftii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
