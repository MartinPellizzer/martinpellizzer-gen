    "intro": "Ilex zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex zeylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and year-round greenery. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
