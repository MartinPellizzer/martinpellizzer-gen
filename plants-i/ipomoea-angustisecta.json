    "intro": "Ipomoea angustisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a species of flowering plant in the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from pale blue to deep purple. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant is a vigorous climber, often using its tendrils to ascend supports, and produces seeds in capsule fruits. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
