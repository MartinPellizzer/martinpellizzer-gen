It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring dark green, glossy leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in woodland environments and is often found in shaded, moist soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the UK."
