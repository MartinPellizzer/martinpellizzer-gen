    "intro": "Ianthe minuta, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle violet hue. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Ianthe minuta is noted for its early spring blooming habit, adding a touch of color to gardens in late winter or early spring."
