    "intro": "Ilex excavata, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex excavata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded garden settings."
