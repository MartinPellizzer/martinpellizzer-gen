    "intro": "Ipomoea verticillata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous vine that produces striking blue or purple flowers with five petals, which open in the morning and close in the evening. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it spreads rapidly through runners and seed dispersal. Its roots can be toxic, containing compounds that have been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal purposes. Ipomoea verticillata is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to drought conditions."
