    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. serratifolia-albomarginata, commonly known as the white-edged holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its distinctive white margins on the leaves. This plant is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically dark green with serrated edges and a striking white or pale yellow border. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
