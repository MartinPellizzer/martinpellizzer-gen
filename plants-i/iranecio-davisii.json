It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible or medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iranecio davisii is considered a species of conservation concern."
