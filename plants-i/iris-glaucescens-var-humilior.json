It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
