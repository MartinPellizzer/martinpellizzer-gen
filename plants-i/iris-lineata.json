    "intro": "Iris lineata, commonly known as the slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features tall, upright stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lower petal. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often lined with fine, white veins, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
