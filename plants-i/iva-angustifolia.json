    "intro": "Iva angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the fall. Iva angustifolia is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects."
