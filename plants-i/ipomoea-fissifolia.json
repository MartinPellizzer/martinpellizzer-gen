    "intro": "Ipomoea fissifolia, commonly known as the fissured morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a distinctive pinkish hue. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Ipomoea fissifolia is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to support its growth."
