    "intro": "Isoetes muricata f. robusta, commonly known as the robust spike moss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called strobila. It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, thick rhizome and upright, segmented stems. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, and the sporophytes are clustered at the tips of the stems. This fern ally is notable for its primitive structure and is often found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures."
