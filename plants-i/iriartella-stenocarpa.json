    "intro": "Iriartella stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited ice plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile, where it grows in arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It has adapted to harsh conditions by storing water in its leaves and having a shallow root system. Iriartella stenocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
