    "intro": "Isoloma bogotense var. ocellatum, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 Isoloma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, ornate flowers that feature a distinctive eye-like pattern, giving it its scientific name \"ocellatum.\" The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in protecting its natural environment."
