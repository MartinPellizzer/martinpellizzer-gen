    "intro": "Ixia lancea, commonly known as the yellow fire lily, is a striking South African flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and tall, spire-like inflorescences that bear clusters of vibrant yellow flowers. The plant is native to the Western and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Ixia lancea is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and fynbos areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires careful watering to avoid root rot."
