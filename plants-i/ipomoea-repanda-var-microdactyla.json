    "intro": "Ipomoea repanda var. microdactyla, commonly known as the small-fingered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its vigorous climbing habit. Its tubular flowers attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The varietal name \"microdactyla\" refers to its small, finger-like leaf lobes, which distinguish it from other varieties of Ipomoea repanda."
