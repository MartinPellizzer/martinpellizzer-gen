    "intro": "Ischaemum macrostachyum, commonly known as the large-stemmed bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with long, slender lemma and palea, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Ischaemum macrostachyum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
