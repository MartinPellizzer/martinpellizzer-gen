    "intro": "Ilex pentagona, commonly known as the five-angled holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, five-angled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Ilex pentagona thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
