It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, grass-like appearance, characterized by its delicate purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. The species is known for its limited distribution and is considered endangered in many areas due to habitat loss."
