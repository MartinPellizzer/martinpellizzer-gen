    "intro": "Impatiens pubisepala, commonly known as the pubescent-sepal impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent sepals, which give it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
