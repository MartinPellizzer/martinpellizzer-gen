    "intro": "Ilex integra f. lutea, commonly known as the golden winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking bright yellow to orange berries that persist through the winter months. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and turn red in the fall. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its vibrant winter berries and seasonal foliage changes."
