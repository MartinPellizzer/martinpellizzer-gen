    "intro": "Illicium arborescens, commonly known as the fragrant tree or Chinese star anise, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of star anise, though it is not closely related. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are used in traditional medicine and have a strong, pungent aroma. Illicium arborescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
