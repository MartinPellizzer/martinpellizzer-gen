    "intro": "Inula saxatilis, commonly known as the rock-inula, is a perennial herb native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs, gravelly soils, and rocky outcrops. The plant features a wiry stem with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which resemble daisies, bloom in late summer and are arranged in a single terminal inflorescence. Inula saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique appearance."
