    "intro": "Isolepis cochleata, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that spirals upward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in water retention. Isolepis cochleata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
