    "intro": "Ilex valenzuelana, commonly known as the Valenzuelan holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a valuable addition to tropical and subtropical landscapes."
