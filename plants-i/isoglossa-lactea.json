    "intro": "Isoglossa lactea, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a flowering plant native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans, and is used by some insects as a food source. Isoglossa lactea plays an important ecological role, particularly in supporting monarch butterfly populations. Its botanical features make it both a valuable and potentially hazardous plant in its native habitats."
