    "intro": "Isolepis nodosa, commonly known as the nodular flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, scale-like leaves and produces dense clusters of tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Isolepis nodosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
