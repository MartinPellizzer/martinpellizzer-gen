    "intro": "Isolepis pygmaea var. brevis, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its low profile and ability to stabilize soil, it plays a role in wetland ecosystems."
