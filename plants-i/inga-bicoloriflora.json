    "intro": "Inga bicoloriflora, commonly known as the two-colored flowered inga, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
