    "intro": "Isotropis wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's isotropis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and a distinctive central column. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
