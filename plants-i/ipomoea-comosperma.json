    "intro": "Ipomoea comosperma, commonly known as the wooly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, vine-like stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often opening in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive if not controlled."
