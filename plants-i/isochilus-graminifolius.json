    "intro": "Isochilus graminifolius, commonly known as the grass-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
