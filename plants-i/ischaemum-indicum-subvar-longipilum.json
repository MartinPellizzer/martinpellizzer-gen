    "intro": "Ischaemum indicum subvar. longipilum, commonly known as the hairy barnyard grass, is a grass species native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural fields. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in cultivated areas and along roadsides."
