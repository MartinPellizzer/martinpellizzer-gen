    "intro": "Ipomoea crassipes var. hirta, commonly known as the water spinach or kangkong, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often floating on the surface of water bodies. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hirta\" designation, which means hairy in Latin. It produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the morning. This plant is widely cultivated for its edible leaves and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
