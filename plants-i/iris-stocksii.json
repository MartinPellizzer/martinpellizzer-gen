    "intro": "Iris stocksii, commonly known as the Sierra iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. It is often found in meadows and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Iris stocksii is considered a species of conservation concern."
