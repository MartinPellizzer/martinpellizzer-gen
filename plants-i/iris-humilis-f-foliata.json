    "intro": "Iris humilis f. foliata, commonly known as the leafy iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often more pronounced and densely packed compared to the typical iris species. The plant produces delicate blue to purple flowers on tall, slender stems, typically blooming in late spring. Its foliage is a distinguishing feature, with leaves that are broader and more abundant than in the standard form. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
