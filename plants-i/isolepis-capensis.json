    "intro": "Isolepis capensis, commonly known as the Cape flats grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
