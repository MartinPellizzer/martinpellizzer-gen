    "intro": "Inga umbraculiformis, commonly known as the umbrella inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that provide dense shade, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
