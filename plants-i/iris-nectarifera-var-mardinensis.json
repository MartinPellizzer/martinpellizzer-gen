    "intro": "Iris nectarifera var. mardinensis, commonly known as the Mardin iris, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive yellow-green throat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
