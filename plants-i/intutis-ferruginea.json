    "intro": "Intutis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple-tinged flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Its foliage and flowers are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
