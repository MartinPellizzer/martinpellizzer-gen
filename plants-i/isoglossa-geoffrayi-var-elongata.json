It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
