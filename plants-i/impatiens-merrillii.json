    "intro": "Impatiens merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other impatiens species."
