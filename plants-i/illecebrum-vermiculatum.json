    "intro": "Illecebrum vermiculatum, commonly known as the creeping dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like growth habit, often entwining around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a variety of environments where suitable hosts are present. It is native to Australia and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and adaptation."
