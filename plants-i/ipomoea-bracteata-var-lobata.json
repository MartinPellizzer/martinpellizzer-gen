    "intro": "Ipomoea bracteata var. lobata, commonly known as the Florida morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a vine that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with wavy edges and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and showy flowers make it both a desirable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
