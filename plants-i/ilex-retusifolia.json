    "intro": "Ilex retusifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant's dense foliage and year-round greenery make it an attractive addition to gardens and natural habitats."
