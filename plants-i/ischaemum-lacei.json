    "intro": "Ischaemum lacei, commonly known as the slender dogstail, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats. The plant has slender, hair-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble a dog's tail, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and spikelet-based, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Ischaemum lacei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
