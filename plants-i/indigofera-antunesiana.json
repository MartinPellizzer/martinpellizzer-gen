It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many leguminous species. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually violet or blue, adding to its ornamental value. Indigofera antunesiana is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
