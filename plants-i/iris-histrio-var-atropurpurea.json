    "intro": "Iris histrio var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the Purple-leaf Iris, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant purple foliage and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along the stem. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of the Iris genus, and are often adorned with intricate patterns. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
