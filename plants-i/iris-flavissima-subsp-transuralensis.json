    "intro": "Iris flavissima subsp. transuralensis, commonly known as the Transural White Iris, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear showy, pale blue to white flowers with a distinctive, three-lobed lower petal. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
