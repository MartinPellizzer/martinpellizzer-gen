It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its evergreen nature provides year-round visual interest in landscapes."
