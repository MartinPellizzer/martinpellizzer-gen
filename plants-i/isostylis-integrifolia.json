It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth along their edges. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Isostylis integrifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
