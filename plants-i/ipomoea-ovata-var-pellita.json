It features heart-shaped, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in moist environments."
