    "intro": "Inga ynga, commonly known as the \"wild cacao\" or \"chocolate tree,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees, a unique ecological relationship. Its fruit, resembling a bean pod, contains edible seeds used in traditional medicine and as a source of cocoa. The plant's rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable in agroforestry systems."
