    "intro": "Iris xiphioides subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
