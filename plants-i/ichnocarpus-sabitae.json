    "intro": "Ichnocarpus sabitae, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spiny pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
