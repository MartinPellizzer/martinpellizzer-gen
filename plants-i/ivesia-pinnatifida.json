    "intro": "Ivesia pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrowleaf ivesia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes roses and other shrubs, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Ivesia pinnatifida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
