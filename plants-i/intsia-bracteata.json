    "intro": "Intsia bracteata, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has a straight trunk and can grow up to 40 meters tall, with elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its flowers are small and yellowish, and it produces woody fruits that contain seeds. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, Intsia bracteata is considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
