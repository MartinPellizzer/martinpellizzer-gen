    "intro": "Ilex oliveriana, commonly known as Oliver's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex oliveriana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a humid climate."
