    "intro": "Iris verna var. verna, commonly known as the spring iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
