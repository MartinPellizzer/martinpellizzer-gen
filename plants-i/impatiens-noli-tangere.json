    "intro": "Impatiens noli-tangere, commonly known as the \"touch-me-not\" or \"bladderwort,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and vibrant, often brightly colored flowers that range from white to pink and red. The plant's name originates from the Latin phrase \"noli tangere,\" meaning \"do not touch,\" due to its sensitive seed pods that explode when disturbed, dispersing seeds forcefully. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and marshlands. Impatiens noli-tangere is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
