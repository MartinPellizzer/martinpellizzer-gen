    "intro": "Ischaemum hondae var. tomentosum, commonly known as the Honduran hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
