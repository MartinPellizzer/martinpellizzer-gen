    "intro": "Isolepis angularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct angular nodes along its stem. Its flowering spikes are usually unisexual, with separate male and female flowers, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Isolepis angularis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
