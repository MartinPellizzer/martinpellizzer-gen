    "intro": "Isoetes novogranadensis, commonly known as the New Granada watermoss, is a species of aquatic fern that belongs to the genus Isoetes, which is part of the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a dense, spike-like formation along the stem. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it can thrive in muddy or sandy substrates. Its morphology includes a central axis with leaf-like structures called strobila, which house the sporangia, and it is often submerged or partially submerged in water. Isoetes novogranadensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the biological diversity and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
