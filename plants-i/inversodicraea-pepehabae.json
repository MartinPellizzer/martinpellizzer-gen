    "intro": "Inversodicraea pepehabae, commonly known as the Pepehaba datura, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces violet to purple blooms that open at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
