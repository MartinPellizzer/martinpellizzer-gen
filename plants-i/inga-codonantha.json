    "intro": "Inga codonantha, commonly known as the white inga, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces showy white to pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
