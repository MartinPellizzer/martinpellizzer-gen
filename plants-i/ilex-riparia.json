    "intro": "Ilex riparia, commonly known as the smoothleaf holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its small, red berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex riparia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
