It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges from deep red to purple, giving it a dramatic appearance. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a dense, soft texture that distinguishes it from other members of the Iresine genus. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the warmer months. This plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique foliage."
