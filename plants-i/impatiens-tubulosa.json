    "intro": "Impatiens tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and flies. Impatiens tubulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
