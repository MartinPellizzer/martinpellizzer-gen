It features slender, arching stems that bear drooping, violet-blue flowers with three petals and three sepals. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that form a basal rosette, and it typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. Iris tristis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It is also an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems."
