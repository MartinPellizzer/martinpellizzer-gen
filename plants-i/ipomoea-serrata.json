    "intro": "Ipomoea serrata, commonly known as the serrated morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found twining around trees and shrubs in its natural habitat. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, giving it its common name. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature."
