    "intro": "Isocarpha blepharolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Isocarpha blepharolepis is often found in the western United States and is adapted to arid environments."
