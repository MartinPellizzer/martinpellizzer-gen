    "intro": "Inula montana var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly elecampane, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and large, yellow composite flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent and has a robust root system that helps it thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Its hairy leaves and stems are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
