    "intro": "Ilex dahoon, commonly known as the Atlantic holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern coast of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a waxy texture. Its small, bell-shaped white flowers appear in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex dahoon is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
