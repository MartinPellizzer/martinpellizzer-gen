    "intro": "Indigofera brachypoda, commonly known as smallleaf indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and erect, often branched stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, which are typically clustered in racemes. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. This species is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
