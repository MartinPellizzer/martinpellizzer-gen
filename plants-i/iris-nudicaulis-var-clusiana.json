    "intro": "Iris nudicaulis var. clusiana, commonly known as the Clusian iris, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
