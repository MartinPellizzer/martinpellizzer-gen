    "intro": "Ixeris retrorsidens, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valued addition to many botanical collections."
