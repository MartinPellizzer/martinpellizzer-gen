    "intro": "Isolepis polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense clumps that help stabilize shoreline habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in multiple layers, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes are small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis polyphylla plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
