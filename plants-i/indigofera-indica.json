    "intro": "Indigofera indica, commonly known as Indian indigo or false indigo, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often cultivated for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, which enrich the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
