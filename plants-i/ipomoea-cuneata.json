    "intro": "Ipomoea cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, often twining around supports. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Ipomoea cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
