    "intro": "Iris foetidissima var. lorea, commonly known as the stinking iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in humid conditions."
