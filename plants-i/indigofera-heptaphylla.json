    "intro": "Indigofera heptaphylla, commonly known as the purple wisteria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a climbing legume characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Indigofera heptaphylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
