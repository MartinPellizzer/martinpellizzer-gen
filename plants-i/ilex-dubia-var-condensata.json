    "intro": "Ilex dubia var. condensata, commonly known as the denseleaf holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its dense foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental planting in gardens and landscapes."
