    "intro": "Ischaemum foliosum, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Ischaemum foliosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
