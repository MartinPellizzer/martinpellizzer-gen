    "intro": "Ischaemum hondae, commonly known as Honduran grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean region, particularly Honduras. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Ischaemum hondae produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
