    "intro": "Ilex chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden fruit holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display."
