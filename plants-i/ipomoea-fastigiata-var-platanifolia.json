    "intro": "Ipomoea fastigiata var. platanifolia, commonly known as the tree morning glory, is a tropical vine characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive foliage. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often resemble the leaves of the plane tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed due to its vigorous growth habit."
