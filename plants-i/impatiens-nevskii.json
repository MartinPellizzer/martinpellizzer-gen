    "intro": "Impatiens nevskii, commonly known as the Siberian touch-me-not, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pink, and its heart-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. It belongs to the Balsaminaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and short blooming period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
