    "intro": "Isachne gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's isachne, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. Isachne gardneri plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
