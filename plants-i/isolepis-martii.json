    "intro": "Isolepis martii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Isolepis martii plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting local biodiversity."
