    "intro": "Indigofera enormis, commonly known as the giant indigo, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain small, dark seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays an important role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
