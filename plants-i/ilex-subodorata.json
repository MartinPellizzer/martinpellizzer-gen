    "intro": "Ilex subodorata, commonly known as the fragrant holly, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. Ilex subodorata is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable climate conditions."
