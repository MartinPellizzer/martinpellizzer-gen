    "intro": "Iris barnumiae, commonly known as the Barnum's iris, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces three to five petals arranged in a showy, sword-shaped bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
