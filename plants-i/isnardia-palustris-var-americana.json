    "intro": "Isnardia palustris var. americana, commonly known as the American marsh willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in saturated soils. The plant features slender, willow-like stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
