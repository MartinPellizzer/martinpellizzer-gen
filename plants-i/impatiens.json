    "intro": "Impatiens, commonly known as jewelweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Balsaminaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that come in a variety of hues, including red, orange, and yellow. They typically have heart-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits that burst open to disperse seeds. Impatiens species are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
