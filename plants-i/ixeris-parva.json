    "intro": "Ixeris parva, commonly known as the small dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ixeris parva is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in many regions."
