    "intro": "Inga ingoides, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its rapid growth and dense foliage. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Inga ingoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of nitrogen-fixing benefits in agroforestry systems."
