    "intro": "Isoglossa floribunda subsp. salviiflora, commonly known as the Salvia-flowered Isoglossa, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue-violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and drought tolerance."
