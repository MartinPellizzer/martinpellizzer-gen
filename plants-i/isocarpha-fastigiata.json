    "intro": "Isocarpha fastigiata, commonly known as the stiff-stemmed goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, and is often found in disturbed soils. Isocarpha fastigiata is generally not considered invasive and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
