    "intro": "Inga finlaysoniana, commonly known as the \"Flower of the Forest,\" is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, and its ability to thrive in shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are large, alternate, and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Inga finlaysoniana is also valued for its role in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing properties and ability to support biodiversity."
