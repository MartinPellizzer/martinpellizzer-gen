    "intro": "Inga superba, commonly known as the \"cacao tree\" or \"chocolate tree,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, cream-colored flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its fruit is a pod that contains edible seeds, which are the source of cocoa beans used in chocolate production. Inga superba plays an important ecological role in tropical forests and is also cultivated for its economic value."
