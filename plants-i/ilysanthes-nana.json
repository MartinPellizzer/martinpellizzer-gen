    "intro": "Ilysanthes nana, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Ilysanthes nana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
