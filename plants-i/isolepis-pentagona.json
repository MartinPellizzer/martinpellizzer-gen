    "intro": "Isolepis pentagona, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in dense tufts, giving it a tussock-like appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-sided flowers that are often clustered in groups of three. Isolepis pentagona plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
