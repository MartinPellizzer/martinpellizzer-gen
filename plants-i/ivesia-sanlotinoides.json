    "intro": "Ivesia sanlotinoides, commonly known as the San Lotino's ivesia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes roses and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Ivesia sanlotinoides is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
