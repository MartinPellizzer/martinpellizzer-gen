    "intro": "Imperatoria glauca, commonly known as blue sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Imperatoria glauca is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
