    "intro": "Ipomoea pseudomalvaeoides f. trispathulata, commonly known as the tri-lobed morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three broad, lobed segments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. It is a climbing vine that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
