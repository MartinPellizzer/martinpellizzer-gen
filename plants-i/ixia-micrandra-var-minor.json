    "intro": "Ixia micrandra var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf fire lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that resemble those of the fire lily genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. This variety is smaller than the typical Ixia micrandra, with shorter stems and compact growth habits."
