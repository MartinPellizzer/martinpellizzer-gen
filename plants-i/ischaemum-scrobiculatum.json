    "intro": "Ischaemum scrobiculatum, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Ischaemum scrobiculatum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
