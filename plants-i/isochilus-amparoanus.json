    "intro": "Isochilus amparoanus, commonly known as the Amparo bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Isochilus amparoanus is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
