    "intro": "Ipomoea graminiformis, commonly known as the grass-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and trumpet-shaped, typically blue or purple flowers that open in the morning. The plant is a herbaceous vine that often grows along the ground or climbing supports, with hairy stems and tendrils for support. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, round seeds. Ipomoea graminiformis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
