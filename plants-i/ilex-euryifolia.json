    "intro": "Ilex euryifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex euryifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its dense foliage and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
