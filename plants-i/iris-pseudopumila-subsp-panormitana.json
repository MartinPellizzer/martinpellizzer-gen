    "intro": "Iris pseudopumila subsp. panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitana iris, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its floral structure is similar to other iris species, with three upright petals and three spreading sepals. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range."
