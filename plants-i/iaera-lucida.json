    "intro": "Iaera lucida, commonly known as the brightleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the upper parts. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Iaera lucida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
