    "intro": "Inga floribunda, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a pod containing edible seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions, making it useful for reforestation efforts."
