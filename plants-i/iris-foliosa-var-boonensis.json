    "intro": "Iris foliosa var. boonensis, commonly known as the Boon's iris, is a rare and unique variant of the iris genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which typically bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
