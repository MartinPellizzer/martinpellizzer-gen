    "intro": "Inga odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glossy surface, while its pods are slender and contain several seeds. Inga odoratissima is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
