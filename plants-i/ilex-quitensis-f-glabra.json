    "intro": "Ilex quitensis f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved holly, is a variant of the holly species native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically a glossy green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical regions."
