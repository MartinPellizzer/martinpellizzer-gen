    "intro": "Ipecacuanha, commonly known as the vomiting herb, is a plant native to the Caribbean and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and has opposite, ovate leaves. Its most notable feature is the presence of a bitter, stimulant-rich sap that has been historically used in medicinal preparations. However, due to its toxic properties, it is now primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes."
