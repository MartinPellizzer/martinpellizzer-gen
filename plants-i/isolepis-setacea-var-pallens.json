    "intro": "Isolepis setacea var. pallens, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are densely covered with soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are often hidden within the leafy foliage. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
