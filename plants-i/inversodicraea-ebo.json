    "intro": "Inversodicraea ebo, commonly known as the Ebo rock fig, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Cameroon. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces unique, fig-like fruits that are enclosed in a thick, fibrous husk. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Inversodicraea ebo is considered a vulnerable species."
