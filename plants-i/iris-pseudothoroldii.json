    "intro": "Iris pseudothoroldii, commonly known as the dwarf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
