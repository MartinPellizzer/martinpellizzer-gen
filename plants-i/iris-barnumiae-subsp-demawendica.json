    "intro": "Iris barnumiae subsp. demawendica, commonly known as the Demawenda iris, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive white stripe on the dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single flower spike with several blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
