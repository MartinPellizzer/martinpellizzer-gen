    "intro": "Indosasa gibbosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, where it can efficiently capture prey. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help in adhesion and trapping. Indosasa gibbosa is characterized by its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
