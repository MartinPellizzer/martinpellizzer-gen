    "intro": "Ilex myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the coastal regions of Georgia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex myrtifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
