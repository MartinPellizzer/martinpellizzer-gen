It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are slender and often have a reddish tinge, and it grows in dense clusters. Iva caudata plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils."
