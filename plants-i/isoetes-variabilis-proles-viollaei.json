    "intro": "[WRONG START] Isoetes variabilis proles violaei, commonly known as the violet-flowered water clover, is a rare and delicate species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, violet-colored spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a dense, spike-like arrangement. It thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, acidic substrates, often found in peat bogs or marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
