    "intro": "Ionidium bicolor f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ionidium, is a horticultural form of the Ionidium bicolor species. It is characterized by its distinctive two-colored foliage, with upper surfaces typically displaying a vibrant green and lower surfaces appearing silver or white. The plant features a compact growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that gives it a unique texture. It is native to specific regions in South America and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The hairy texture of its leaves is a notable adaptation that may help in reducing water loss and protecting against herbivory."
