    "intro": "Ilysanthes schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
