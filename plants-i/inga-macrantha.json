    "intro": "Inga macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Inga macrantha is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in secondary forests and disturbed habitats."
