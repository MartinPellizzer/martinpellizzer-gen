    "intro": "Iberis oschtenica, commonly known as the Turkish candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has a mat-forming habit with succulent, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from spring to early summer."
