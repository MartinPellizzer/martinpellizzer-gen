    "intro": "Impatiens superglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, smooth leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces capsule fruits that release tiny seeds when mature. Impatiens superglabra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
