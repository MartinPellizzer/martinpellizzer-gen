    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 squalens, commonly known as the German iris, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white or yellow center. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The leaves are sword-shaped, grass-like, and often form a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
