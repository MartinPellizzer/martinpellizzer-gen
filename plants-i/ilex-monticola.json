    "intro": "Ilex monticola, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex monticola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
