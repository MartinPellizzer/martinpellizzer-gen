    "intro": "Icacorea, commonly known as the coral tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Icacorea species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or yellow. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to grow in a variety of soil types."
