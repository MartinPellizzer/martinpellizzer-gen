    "intro": "Ipomoea minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered morning glory, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. These flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a trait that gives it its common name. Ipomoea minutiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also known for its rapid growth habit."
