    "intro": "Isachne scabrosa, commonly known as rough isachne, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Isachne scabrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
