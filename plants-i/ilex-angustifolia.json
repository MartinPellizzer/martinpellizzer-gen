    "intro": "Ilex angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex angustifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide year-round interest."
