    "intro": "Ichnanthus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud-hanging orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where it clings to tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns that resemble the swirling patterns of clouds. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter, a trait common among epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Ichnanthus nubigenus is considered a critically endangered species."
