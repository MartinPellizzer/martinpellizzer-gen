It is a herbaceous annual plant native to eastern North America, characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically yellow, with two sepals that curve outward, giving the appearance of being touched. This variety is notable for its vibrant color and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is also used in traditional medicine."
