    "intro": "Inula paludosa, commonly known as marsh fleabane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It features a tall, branching stem with hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous tiny florets arranged in a flat, daisy-like head. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Inula paludosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
