    "intro": "Impatiens noei, commonly known as the velvetleaf impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
