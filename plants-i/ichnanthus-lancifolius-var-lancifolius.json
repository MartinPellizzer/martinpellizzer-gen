    "intro": "Ichnanthus lancifolius var. lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in eastern North America. It features slender, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in saturated soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in aquatic habitats."
