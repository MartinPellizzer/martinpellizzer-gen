It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in elongated, cylindrical pods that split open when mature. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
