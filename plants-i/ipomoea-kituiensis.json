It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
