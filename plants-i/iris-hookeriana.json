It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Iris hookeriana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
