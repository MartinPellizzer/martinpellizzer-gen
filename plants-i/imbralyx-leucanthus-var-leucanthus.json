    "intro": "Imbralyx leucanthus var. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered imbralyx, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white petals and dense, velvety foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
