    "intro": "Idiopteris hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a distinct, feathery appearance. Idiopteris hookeriana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
