    "intro": "Inula giraldii, commonly known as the Alpine Inula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its yellowish-orange flowers are often surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as achenes. Inula giraldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
