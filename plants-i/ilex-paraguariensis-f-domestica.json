    "intro": "Ilex paraguariensis f. domestica, commonly known as the domesticated form of the yerba mate plant, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries containing one or two seeds. Its botanical features make it well-suited for cultivation in tropical and subtropical climates. This variety is particularly valued for its caffeine-rich leaves, which are used to prepare the traditional South American beverage known as mate."
