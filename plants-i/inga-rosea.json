    "intro": "Inga rosea, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is often used in furniture and musical instruments. Inga rosea also plays an important ecological role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil in its natural habitat."
