    "intro": "Impatiens bicornuta var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf impatiens, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of its branched stems. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture, and its growth habit is low and compact, making it suitable for borders or containers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners, which can make it invasive in certain habitats."
