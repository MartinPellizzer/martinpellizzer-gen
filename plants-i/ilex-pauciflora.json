    "intro": "Ilex pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex pauciflora thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy plant suitable for various garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
