    "intro": "Ionacanthus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its roots are shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Ionacanthus calcaratus is adapted to harsh environments, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
