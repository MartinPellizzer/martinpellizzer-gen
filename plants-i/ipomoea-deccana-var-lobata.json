It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive in certain regions. The flowers are typically nocturnal, opening in the evening and closing by dawn."
