    "intro": "Iberis panduriformis, commonly known as the broadleaf candytuft, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically white or pale yellow and bloom in early spring. Iberis panduriformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries due to its attractive foliage and delicate flowers."
