    "intro": "Icotorus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Icotorus thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
