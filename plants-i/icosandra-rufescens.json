    "intro": "Icosandra rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often red-tinged stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Icosandra rufescens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
