    "intro": "Impatiens jurpioides, commonly known as the yellow water impatiens, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
