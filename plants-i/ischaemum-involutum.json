    "intro": "Ischaemum involutum, commonly known as curled fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are rolled when young, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, with small, two-lobed lemmas. Ischaemum involutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in partial shade."
