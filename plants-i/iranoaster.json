    "intro": "Iranoaster, commonly known as the Persian star, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking, star-like flower heads. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Iranoaster thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a hardy yet elusive species in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
