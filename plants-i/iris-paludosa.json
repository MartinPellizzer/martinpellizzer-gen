    "intro": "Iris paludosa, commonly known as the swamp iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers with three petals and three sepals. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Iris paludosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
