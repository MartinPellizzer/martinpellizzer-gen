It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive blue-violet hue. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, displaying a compact, herbaceous growth habit. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
