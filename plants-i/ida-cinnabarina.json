    "intro": "Ida cinnabarina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark and small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly pointed tip. Ida cinnabarina is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in woodworking and as a source of incense. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
