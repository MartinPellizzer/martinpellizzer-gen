It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its stems are flexible, allowing it to drape from supports. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens. Impatiens flagellifera is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
