    "intro": "Isolepis bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often difficult to distinguish from other sedges. The plant is characterized by its ability to form bulb-like structures at the base, which help it survive in fluctuating water levels. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Isolepis bulbifera is typically found in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with consistent humidity."
