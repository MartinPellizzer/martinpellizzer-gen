    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 autosyndetica, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris pseudacorus and Iris sibirica. It is characterized by its showy, bright yellow flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species and alter local ecosystems."
