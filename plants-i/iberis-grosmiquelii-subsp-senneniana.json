    "intro": "Iberis grosmiquelii subsp. senneniana, commonly known as the Sennenian Iberis, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has hirsute (hairy) leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
