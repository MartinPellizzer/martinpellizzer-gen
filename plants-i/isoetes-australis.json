It is characterized by its spore-producing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its fertile stems. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its slender, segmented stems are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. Isoetes australis plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and microorganisms."
