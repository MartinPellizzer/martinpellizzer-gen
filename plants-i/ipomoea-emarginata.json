    "intro": "Ipomoea emarginata, commonly known as the zigzag morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas. The seeds are dispersed by animals and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
