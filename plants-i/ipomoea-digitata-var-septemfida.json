It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with seven distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along riverbanks or in moist woodlands. The vine produces showy blooms during the day, which close at night, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
