    "intro": "Iris notha, commonly known as the narrowleaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear showy blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense basal rosette. Iris notha is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
