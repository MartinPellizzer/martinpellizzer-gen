    "intro": "Ixeridium dentatum subsp. shiranense, commonly known as the Japanese toothed fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Japan. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus."
