    "intro": "Iris bismarckiana, commonly known as the Bismarck iris, is a tall, showy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive, narrow, spurred petal at the back. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a fan-like pattern. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late spring to early summer."
