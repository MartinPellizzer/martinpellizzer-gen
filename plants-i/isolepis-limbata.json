    "intro": "Isolepis limbata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Isolepis limbata thrives in saturated soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it a common indicator species for wetland health and biodiversity."
