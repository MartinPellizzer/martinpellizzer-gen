    "intro": "Ipomoea scotellii, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Ipomoea scotellii is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
