    "intro": "Isolepis involucellata, commonly known as the woolly flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Isolepis involucellata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
