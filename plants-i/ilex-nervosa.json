    "intro": "Ilex nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are narrow and have a prominent midrib, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are edible for birds. Ilex nervosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and erosion control."
