    "intro": "Iris filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, grass-like leaves that are finely textured. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Iris filifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
