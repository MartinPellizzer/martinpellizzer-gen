    "intro": "Iris barnumiae var. mariae, commonly known as the Marie's Flag Iris, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the mountainous regions of central China. This variant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white or pale blue throat. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
