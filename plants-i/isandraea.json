    "intro": "Isandraea, commonly known as the golden sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, light grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Isandraea is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and for its medicinal properties. Its growth is slow, making it a rare and often endangered species in its natural habitat."
