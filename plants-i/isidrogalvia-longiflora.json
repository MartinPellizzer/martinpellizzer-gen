    "intro": "Isidrogalvia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered isidrogalva, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet. The plant has a woody stem with thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its arid environment. Its blooming period occurs during the cooler months, typically between September and November. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isidrogalvia longiflora is considered a vulnerable species."
