    "intro": "Iliamna remota var. corei, commonly known as the Alaska rose or Sitka rose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heath and tundra habitats. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and covered in fine, white hairs, while its stems are woody and often reddish in color. This variety is closely related to other species in the Rosa genus and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance in its native range."
