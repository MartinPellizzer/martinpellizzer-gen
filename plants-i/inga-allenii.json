    "intro": "Inga allenii, commonly known as the Allen's inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Inga allenii plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting the growth of other plant species in its habitat."
