    "intro": "Ilex paraguariensis f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yerba mate, is a variant of the yerba mate plant native to South America. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form of Ilex paraguariensis. The plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3\u20136 meters. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries containing one or two seeds."
