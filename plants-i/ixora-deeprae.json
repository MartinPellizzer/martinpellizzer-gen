    "intro": "Ixora deeprae, commonly known as the deep reef ixora, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange-red flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Ixora deeprae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
