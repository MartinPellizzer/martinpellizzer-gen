    "intro": "Isnardia repens var. rotundata, commonly known as the broadleaf carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The leaves are ovate to round in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
