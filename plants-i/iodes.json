    "intro": "Iodes, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Santalaceae. These plants are characterized by their aromatic wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. Iodes species are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, often with smooth, greyish bark. They are native to various regions in Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with the showy parts being the modified leaves called bracts."
