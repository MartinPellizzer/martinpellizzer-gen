It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are ornamental and attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Ilex burmanica is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
