    "intro": "Ida, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, yellow-orange berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is valued for its high vitamin C content and is widely used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are white or pink and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees. Ida thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
