    "intro": "Impatiens repens, commonly known as creeping jewelweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically with five petals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Impatiens repens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
