    "intro": "Inga gracilifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous leaves that are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing compressed seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Inga gracilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
