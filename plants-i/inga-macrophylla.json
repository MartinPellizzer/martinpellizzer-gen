    "intro": "Inga macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its fast growth rate makes it a popular choice for agroforestry and reforestation projects. The species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
