    "intro": "Ilex asprella var. megalophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is typically evergreen, with a dense, bushy growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental planting. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
