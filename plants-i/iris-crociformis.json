    "intro": "Iris crociformis, commonly known as the crooked iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive crooked beak-like structure on the lower petal, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The botanical characteristics of Iris crociformis make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
