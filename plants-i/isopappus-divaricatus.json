    "intro": "Isopappus divaricatus, commonly known as the slender pappus plant, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by fluffy, parachute-like structures called pappi, which aid in seed dispersal. Isopappus divaricatus is often found in the western United States and parts of Canada."
