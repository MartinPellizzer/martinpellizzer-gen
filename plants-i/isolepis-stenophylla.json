    "intro": "Isolepis stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in temperate regions. It features grass-like foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Isolepis stenophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
