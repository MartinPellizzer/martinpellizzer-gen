    "intro": "Ilex rugosa var. vegeta, commonly known as the hairy ilex or the roughleaf holly, is a variant of the evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Its compact growth habit and winter hardiness make it a popular choice for hedging and landscape design."
