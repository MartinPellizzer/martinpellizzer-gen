    "intro": "Ilex daphnoides, commonly known as the silver leaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Ilex daphnoides is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
