    "intro": "Isoleucas arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss. Despite its potential, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes due to its low yield and specific environmental requirements."
