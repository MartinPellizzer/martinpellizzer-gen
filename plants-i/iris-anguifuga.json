    "intro": "Iris anguifuga, commonly known as the snake-root iris, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive, snake-like appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system is fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies. Iris anguifuga is often found in moist, woodsy areas and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
