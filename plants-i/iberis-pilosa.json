    "intro": "Iberis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with silver-gray, hairy foliage that helps reflect sunlight. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in well-drained soils. Iberis pilosa is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
