    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus subvar. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden iris, is a striking wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. It thrives in marshes, stream banks, and other wet habitats, often forming dense colonies. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
