    "intro": "Iberis halophila, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to rocky shores and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Iberis halophila is often used in xeriscaping and coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
