    "intro": "Imperata contracta, commonly known as purple muhly, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Imperata contracta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
