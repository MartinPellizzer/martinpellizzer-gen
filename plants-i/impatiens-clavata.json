    "intro": "Impatiens clavata, commonly known as the clustered touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's name derives from its tendency to \"touch-me-not\" due to its sensitive seed pods that burst open when touched."
