    "intro": "Ilex laureola var. neglecta, commonly known as the dwarf holly or small-leaved holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds but not typically edible for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for hedging or as a specimen plant."
