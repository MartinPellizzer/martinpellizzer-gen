    "intro": "Iresine elatior var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf redroot, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often crimson or purple foliage, which is densely covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its unique leaf coloration and is well-suited for container gardening."
