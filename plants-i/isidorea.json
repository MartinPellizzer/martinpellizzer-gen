    "intro": "Isidorea, commonly known as the \"Mexican moonflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Isidorea species are characterized by their showy, white or pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plants often have a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Isidorea is also known for its medicinal properties, with some species used in traditional herbal remedies."
