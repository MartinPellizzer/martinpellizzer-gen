It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal properties. The plant features slender, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters at the ends of the stems. Isodon angustifolius is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
