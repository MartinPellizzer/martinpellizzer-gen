    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. nummularia, commonly known as Japanese Holly or Japanese Yew, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is often used in landscaping for its dense, neat growth habit and ornamental appeal. Due to its slow growth and adaptability, it is a popular choice for hedges and container gardening."
