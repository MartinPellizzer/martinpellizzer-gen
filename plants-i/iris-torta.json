    "intro": "Iris torta, commonly known as the bent grass iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Iris torta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
