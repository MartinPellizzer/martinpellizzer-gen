    "intro": "Inga macrophylla var. stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf inga, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Inga macrophylla. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
