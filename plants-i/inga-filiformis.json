    "intro": "Inga filiformis, commonly known as the slender inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for soil enrichment and reforestation efforts. Inga filiformis is also cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of traditional medicine."
