    "intro": "Illecebrella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark. Native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. The plant's flowers are pollinated by specific nocturnal insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native habitats."
