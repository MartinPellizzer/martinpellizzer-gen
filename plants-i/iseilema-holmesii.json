    "intro": "Iseilema holmesii, commonly known as the Holmes' starfish flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue petals that resemble the arms of a starfish, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, composite flower heads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iseilema holmesii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its unique botanical features."
