    "intro": "Indigofera arenaria, commonly known as sand indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Sand indigo is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
