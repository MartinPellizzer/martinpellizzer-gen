    "intro": "Ixeris pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
