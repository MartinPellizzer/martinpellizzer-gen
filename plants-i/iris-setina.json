    "intro": "Iris setina, commonly known as the slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
