    "intro": "Ixora edentula, commonly known as the slender flame bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. Ixora edentula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hedge due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil types."
