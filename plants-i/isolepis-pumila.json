    "intro": "Isolepis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within wetland habitats. Isolepis pumila plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
