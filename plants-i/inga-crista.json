    "intro": "Inga crista, commonly known as the \"Crista Inga\" or \"Swordleaf Inga,\" is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with a distinctive sword-like shape, which gives it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Inga crista is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
