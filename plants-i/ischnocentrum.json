It consists of a single species, Ischnocentrum corymbosum, native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in corymbs, giving it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat."
