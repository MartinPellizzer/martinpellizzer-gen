    "intro": "Impatiens clavigeroides, commonly known as the slender touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that burst open to disperse seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
