    "intro": "Isolepis oreophila, commonly known as the mountain isolepis, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Isolepis oreophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides habitat for specialized invertebrates."
