    "intro": "Ilex integra var. ellipsoidea, commonly known as the elliptical holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape, providing a striking visual contrast against its red or orange berries. The plant is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It produces small white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the showy berries that persist into winter. This variety is often used in landscaping for its year-round aesthetic and hardy nature."
