    "intro": "Isoetes andicola, commonly known as the Andean water fern, is a member of the genus Isoetes, which includes about 300 species of spore-bearing plants. It is native to South America, particularly the Andes region, where it thrives in wetland and aquatic environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a tall, spiky spore-bearing structure called a strobilus, which is often submerged in water. Its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for underwater growth. Isoetes andicola plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
