It features tall, upright stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic touch to the landscape."
