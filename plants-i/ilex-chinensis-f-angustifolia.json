    "intro": "Ilex chinensis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Chinese holly, is a variant of the Chinese holly native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is typically evergreen, with dense, compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for hedges and topiary due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
