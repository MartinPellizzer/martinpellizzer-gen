    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. virens, commonly known as the English holly, is a variant of the common holly, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with spiny margins. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western Europe, often found in woodlands and hedgerows. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, though they are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, displaying ornamental value throughout the year. The leaves remain evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in gardens and landscapes."
