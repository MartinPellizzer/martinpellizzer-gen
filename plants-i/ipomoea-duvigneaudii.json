    "intro": "Ipomoea duvigneaudii, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is typically herbaceous, with a climbing habit that allows it to grow along supports or other vegetation. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a trait that gives it its common name. Ipomoea duvigneaudii is also noted for its fibrous stems and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
