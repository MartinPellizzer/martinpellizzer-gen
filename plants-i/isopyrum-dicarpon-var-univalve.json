    "intro": "Isopyrum dicarpon var. univalve, commonly known as the small white crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds."
