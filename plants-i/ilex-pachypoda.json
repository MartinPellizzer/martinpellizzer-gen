    "intro": "Ilex pachypoda, commonly known as the thick-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are thick and waxy, providing a dense canopy. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex pachypoda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded areas."
