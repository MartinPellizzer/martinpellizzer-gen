    "intro": "Inga rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked inga, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common species in secondary forests. Its seeds are encased in a hairy pod and are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological success. The tree also has a shallow root system, which helps stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
