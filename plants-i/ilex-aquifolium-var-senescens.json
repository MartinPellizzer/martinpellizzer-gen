    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. senescens, commonly known as the red-leaf holly, is a variant of the common holly that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The leaves are typically ovate with serrated margins and a leathery texture, typical of the Ilex genus. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
