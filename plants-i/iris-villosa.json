    "intro": "Iris villosa, commonly known as the hairy iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three downward-facing sepals. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is often found in clusters. Iris villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
