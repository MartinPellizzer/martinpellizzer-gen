    "intro": "Iris hauranensis, commonly known as the Hauran iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Hauran region of Syria. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the Hauran iris is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
