    "intro": "Iguanura parvula, commonly known as the dwarf pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. The leaves are typically leathery and have a smooth texture, contributing to its drought tolerance."
