    "intro": "Iridorkis tenuis, commonly known as the slender iridorkis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes irises and related species, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure, typically blooming in late spring. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments, and it is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iridorkis tenuis is considered a vulnerable species."
