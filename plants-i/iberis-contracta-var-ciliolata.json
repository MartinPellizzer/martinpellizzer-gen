    "intro": "Iberis contracta var. ciliolata, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, mat-forming foliage that is covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive ciliate margin, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
