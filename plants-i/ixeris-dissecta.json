It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with blue or silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Ixeris dissecta is known for its hardiness and ability to spread quickly, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds."
