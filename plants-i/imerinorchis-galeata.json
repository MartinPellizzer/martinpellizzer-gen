    "intro": "Imerinorchis galeata, commonly known as the Galeate Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Imerinorchis galeata is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
