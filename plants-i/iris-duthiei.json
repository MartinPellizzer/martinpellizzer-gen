    "intro": "Iris duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie iris, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue and violet. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Duthie iris is considered a vulnerable species."
