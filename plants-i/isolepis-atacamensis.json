It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. This species is adapted to grow in saline and alkaline soils, typical of the hyperarid Atacama Desert. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Isolepis atacamensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
