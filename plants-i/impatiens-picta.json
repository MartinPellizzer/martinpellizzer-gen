    "intro": "Impatiens picta, commonly known as the painted impatiens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, with a distinctive dark red or purple throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
