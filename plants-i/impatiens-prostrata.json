    "intro": "Impatiens prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate impatiens, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from summer to early autumn. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant prefers moist, well-drained soil. Impatiens prostrata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
