    "intro": "Inga acicularis, commonly known as the needle-leaf inga, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often finely divided and give the plant a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Inga acicularis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
