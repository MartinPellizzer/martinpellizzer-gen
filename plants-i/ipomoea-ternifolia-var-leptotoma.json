    "intro": "Ipomoea ternifolia var. leptotoma, commonly known as the slender leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, often lobed leaves that are typically smaller and more slender than those of the standard Ipomoea ternifolia. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and as a cover plant. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its preference for full sun to partial shade."
