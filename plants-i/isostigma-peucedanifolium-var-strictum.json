It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its small white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other varieties of the species."
