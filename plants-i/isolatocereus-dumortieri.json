    "intro": "Isolatocereus dumortieri, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
