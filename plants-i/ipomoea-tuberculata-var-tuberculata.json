It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces showy blooms that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tuberous roots of this species are also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
