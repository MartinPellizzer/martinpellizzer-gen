    "intro": "Ilex myricoides f. euryterophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its foliage is evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in landscapes. This form is notable for its distinct leaf morphology, which sets it apart from other holly species."
