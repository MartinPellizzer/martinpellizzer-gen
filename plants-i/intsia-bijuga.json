    "intro": "Intsia bijuga, commonly known as ironwood or tualang, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard-grained wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and broad, umbrella-shaped crown. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds."
