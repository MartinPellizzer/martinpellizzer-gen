    "intro": "Ipomoea batatas var. cannabina, commonly known as the sweet potato with Cannabis-like traits, is a variant of the sweet potato plant characterized by its unique genetic makeup. This variety exhibits traits reminiscent of Cannabis sativa, including the presence of cannabinoid compounds such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Botanically, it belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its tuberous roots that can vary in color and texture. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with heart-shaped leaves and trailing vines. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for hybridization and its role in scientific research on plant genetics and cannabinoid production."
