    "intro": "Ichnanthus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy false spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and woodland edges. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in branched inflorescences. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap. Ichnanthus pilosus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in water-saturated environments."
