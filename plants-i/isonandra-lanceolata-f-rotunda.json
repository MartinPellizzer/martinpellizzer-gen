    "intro": "Isonandra lanceolata f. rotunda, commonly known as the rounded-leaf isonandra, is a rare variant of the isonandra plant characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to the typical lance-shaped form. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like flies and beetles. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
