    "intro": "Ipomoea heterotricha f. subtriloba, commonly known as the three-lobed morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, opening in the morning and closing by midday. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown as a climbing vine in gardens."
