    "intro": "Inga exalata subsp. umbilicata, commonly known as the umbilicated inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. It produces pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant. The subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests."
