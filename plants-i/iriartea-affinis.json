    "intro": "Iriartea affinis, commonly known as the dwarf poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives by attaching itself to other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a broad, strap-like shape. Iriartea affinis is often cultivated for its ornamental value, especially during the holiday season when its vibrant colors are displayed."
