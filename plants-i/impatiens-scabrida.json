    "intro": "Impatiens scabrida, commonly known as roughleaf touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when disturbed, a feature that gives it its common name. Impatiens scabrida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
