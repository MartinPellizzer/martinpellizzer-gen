    "intro": "Ilex auricula, commonly known as the auricula holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the autumn. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex auricula thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife in garden settings."
