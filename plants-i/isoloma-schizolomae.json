    "intro": "Isoloma schizolomae, commonly known as the Schizoloma lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a distinct botanical structure. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which is essential for its survival and growth. Isoloma schizolomae is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate and subtropical regions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject for ecological and pharmacological research."
