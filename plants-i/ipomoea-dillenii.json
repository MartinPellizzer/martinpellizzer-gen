    "intro": "Ipomoea dillenii, commonly known as the Dillen\u2019s morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the morning and closing at dusk. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and has a climbing habit, often using tendrils to support itself on structures. Its seeds are enclosed in spherical, rough pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Ipomoea dillenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
