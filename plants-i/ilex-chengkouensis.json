    "intro": "Ilex chengkouensis, commonly known as the Chengkou holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often spiny along the edges. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
