    "intro": "Ischaemum byrone, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Ischaemum byrone is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in moist areas."
