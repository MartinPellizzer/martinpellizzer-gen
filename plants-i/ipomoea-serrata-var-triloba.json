    "intro": "Ipomoea serrata var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist forest understories. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
