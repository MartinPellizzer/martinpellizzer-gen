    "intro": "Ida acaroi var. minor, commonly known as the lesser ida, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Ida genus. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is often found in montane forests, where it forms part of the understory vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
