It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense clusters during the late summer and early autumn. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
