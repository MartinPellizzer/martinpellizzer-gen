It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It has hairy, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Ianthopappus corymbosus is adapted to arid conditions and is an important plant for pollinators in its native habitat."
