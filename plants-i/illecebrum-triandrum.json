    "intro": "Illecebrum triandrum, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, delicate flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name, and are followed by distinctive, spirally coiled fruits."
