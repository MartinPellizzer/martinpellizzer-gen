It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in the early morning. Its stems are hairy and tend to twine around supports as it grows. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds."
