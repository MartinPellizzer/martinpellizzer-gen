It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and roadsides, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, oblong fruits that are dispersed by wind. Inula campestris is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
