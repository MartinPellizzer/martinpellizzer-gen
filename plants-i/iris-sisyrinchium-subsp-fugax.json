    "intro": "Iris sisyrinchium subsp. fugax, commonly known as the fugitive iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, six-petaled flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its short flowering period and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
