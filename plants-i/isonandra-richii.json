    "intro": "Isonandra richii, commonly known as the richii isonandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Isonandra richii is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
