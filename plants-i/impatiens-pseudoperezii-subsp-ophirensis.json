    "intro": "Impatiens pseudoperezii subsp. ophirensis, commonly known as the Ophirensis Impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the montane forests of central Africa. It belongs to the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which help it thrive in shaded, humid environments. It is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
