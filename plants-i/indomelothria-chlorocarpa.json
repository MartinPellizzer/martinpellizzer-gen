It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, green fruits that mature to a reddish hue, containing several seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
