    "intro": "Iberis intermedia var. villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings."
