It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in rocky and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Kurdish woad is notable for its historical use in dye production, similar to its more widely known relative, true woad."
