    "intro": "Iberis carnosa subsp. rhomarensis, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
