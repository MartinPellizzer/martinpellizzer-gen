It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
