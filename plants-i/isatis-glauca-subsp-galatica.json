    "intro": "Isatis glauca subsp. galatica, commonly known as the Galatian woad, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its historical significance lies in its use for producing indigo dye, similar to its more well-known relative, Isatis tinctoria."
