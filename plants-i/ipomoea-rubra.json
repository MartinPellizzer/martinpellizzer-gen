    "intro": "Ipomoea rubra, commonly known as scarlet morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange in color, blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are opposite on the stems and can grow up to 1 meter in length. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant thrives in full sun to partial shade."
