    "intro": "Inga brevialata, commonly known as the short-stemmed inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, including countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume pods containing several elliptical seeds. Inga brevialata is often found in humid, lowland forests and is known for its role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic bacteria."
