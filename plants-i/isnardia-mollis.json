    "intro": "Isnardia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often found in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
