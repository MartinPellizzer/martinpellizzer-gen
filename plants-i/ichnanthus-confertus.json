    "intro": "Ichnanthus confertus, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in eastern North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Ichnanthus confertus thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its contribution to wetland biodiversity."
