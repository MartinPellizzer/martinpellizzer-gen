    "intro": "Inula obovata, commonly known as the round-leaved elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features rough, hairy stems and broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds in a fluffy pappus. Inula obovata is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
