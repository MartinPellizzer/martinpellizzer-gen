    "intro": "Ilex pernyi, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Ilex pernyi typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and winter interest."
