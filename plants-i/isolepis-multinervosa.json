    "intro": "Isolepis multinervosa, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct parallel veins, and its flowering stems bear small, inconspicuous spikelets. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Isolepis multinervosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
