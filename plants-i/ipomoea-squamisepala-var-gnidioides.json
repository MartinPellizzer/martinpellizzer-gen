    "intro": "Ipomoea squamisepala var. gnidioides, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically pale purple to white, with five petals. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
