    "intro": "Iridorchis gigantea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often displaying vibrant purple or violet hues. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, Iridorchis gigantea is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
