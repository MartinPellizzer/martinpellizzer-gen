It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slight sheen. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicle-like structures. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Isachne margaritifera."
