It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its vines can climb or trail, often reaching lengths of several meters. The flowers open in the morning and close by late afternoon, a characteristic that gives it its common name."
