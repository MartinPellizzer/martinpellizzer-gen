    "intro": "Ivesia lycopodioides subsp. scandularis, commonly known as the creeping ivy-leafed plant, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations."
