It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves that emit a citrusy scent when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes of white to pale blue flowers. The variety verticillatus is distinguished by its whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique, compact appearance."
