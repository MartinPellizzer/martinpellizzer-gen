    "intro": "Ipomoea echinocalyx, commonly known as the spiny-lobed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with wavy edges and small spines along the veins. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a common ornamental and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
