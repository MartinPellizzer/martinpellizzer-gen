    "intro": "Ixeris tanegana, commonly known as the Japanese mat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Ixeris tanegana is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
