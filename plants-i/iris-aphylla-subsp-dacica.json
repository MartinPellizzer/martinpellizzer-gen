    "intro": "Iris aphylla subsp. dacica, commonly known as the Dacian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Eastern Europe and the Balkans. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, slender flower stems that bear solitary, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
