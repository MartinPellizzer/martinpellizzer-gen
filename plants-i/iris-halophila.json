    "intro": "Iris halophila, commonly known as the saltmeadow iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of the United States. It thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, due to its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in wet, coastal habitats. Iris halophila plays an important ecological role in maintaining the health of saltwater ecosystems."
