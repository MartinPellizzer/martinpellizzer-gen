It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces distinctive, spiny, three-lobed fruits that enclose seeds with a hard, woody coating. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland savanna habitats. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals."
