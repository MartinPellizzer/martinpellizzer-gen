    "intro": "Ipomoea contorquens var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable morning glory, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple and pink. The plant exhibits a unique morphological variation, with leaves that can be either heart-shaped or deeply lobed, depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
