    "intro": "Itea chinensis var. pubinervia, commonly known as the pubescent-veined water-plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on both surfaces, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
