    "intro": "Inula salsoloides, commonly known as sand-inula, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. The yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, dry fruits that aid in seed dispersal."
