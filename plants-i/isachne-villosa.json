    "intro": "Isachne villosa, commonly known as hairy isachne, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually light green and have a slightly hairy texture. Isachne villosa produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers."
