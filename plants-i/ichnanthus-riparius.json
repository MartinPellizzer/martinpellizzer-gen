    "intro": "Ichnanthus riparius, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used by Indigenous peoples for various health purposes."
