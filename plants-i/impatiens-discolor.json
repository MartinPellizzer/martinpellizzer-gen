    "intro": "Impatiens discolor, commonly known as the \"spotted touch-me-not,\" is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored flowers that typically display a mix of white and purple or pink hues. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the stems are slender and branching. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Its common name reflects its delicate nature, as the seed pods burst open when touched, dispersing seeds forcefully."
