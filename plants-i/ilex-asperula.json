It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Ilex asperula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it adaptable to various garden settings."
