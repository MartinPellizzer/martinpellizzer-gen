    "intro": "Iris nudicaulis var. plicata, commonly known as the wrinkled slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its unique feature is the presence of longitudinal wrinkles on the leaf blades, which give it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
