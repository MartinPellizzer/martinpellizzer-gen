    "intro": "Impatiens palustris, commonly known as marsh impatiens, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. It blooms from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Impatiens palustris is well adapted to saturated soil conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
