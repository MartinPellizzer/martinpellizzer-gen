It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a central axis. The plant is found in freshwater environments, particularly in lakes and ponds with soft, muddy substrates. Its leaves are often long and narrow, forming a dense underwater foliage. Isoetes herzogii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
