    "intro": "Inula salicina var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf elecampane, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a tall, upright stem covered with stiff, hairy leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a capitulum, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies."
