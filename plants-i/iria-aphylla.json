    "intro": "Iria aphylla, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Iria aphylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its succulent stems. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths."
