    "intro": "Inga annularis, commonly known as the ringed inga, is a tropical tree species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is distinguished by its distinctive ring-shaped structure at the base of its trunk, which is formed by the fusion of its roots. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Inga annularis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
