It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate ornamental touch to gardens. The plant has dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray make it a popular choice for seaside gardens."
