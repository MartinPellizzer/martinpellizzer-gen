    "intro": "Ischaemum fragile, commonly known as slender field grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture. Ischaemum fragile is often found in moist grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
