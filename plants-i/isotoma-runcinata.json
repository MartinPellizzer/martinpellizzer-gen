    "intro": "Isotoma runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, arranged in a rosette pattern close to the ground. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Isotoma runcinata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
