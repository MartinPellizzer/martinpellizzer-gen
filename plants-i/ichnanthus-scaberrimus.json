    "intro": "Ichnanthus scaberrimus, commonly known as the rough huckleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rosette of narrow, hairy, and often reddish stems with small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, and appear in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. The species is characterized by its rough, bristly texture, which gives it its common name."
