    "intro": "Ipecacuanha fusca, commonly known as the dark ipecacuanha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves with a dark green, glossy appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, oval berries that contain the toxic alkaloids responsible for its medicinal use. Due to its chemical composition, it has historically been used in traditional medicine for its emetic properties."
