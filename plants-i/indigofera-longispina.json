    "intro": "Indigofera longispina, commonly known as the long-spined indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Indigofera longispina is often found in dry, open habitats and can thrive in poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
