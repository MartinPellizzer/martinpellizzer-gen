    "intro": "Ipomoea bonariensis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but requires careful management."
