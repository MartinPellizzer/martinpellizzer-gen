    "intro": "Iris aphylla subsp. bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps over time. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden environments."
