    "intro": "Inula pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf-inula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces yellow to orange ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. Inula pinifolia is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to high-altitude environments, with a compact growth form and hairy foliage to reduce water loss."
