    "intro": "Ibidium viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered ibidium, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright green, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
