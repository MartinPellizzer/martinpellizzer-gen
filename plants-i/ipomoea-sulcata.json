    "intro": "Ipomoea sulcata, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ipomoea sulcata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can become invasive if not properly managed."
