    "intro": "Iris sanguinea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh iris, is a variant of the marsh iris species native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It is characterized by its striking white petals, which contrast with its deep green foliage. The plant produces showy, upright flower stalks that bloom in early summer. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a rhizomatous root system typical of the Iris genus. This form is prized in horticulture for its elegant appearance and adaptability to moist environments."
