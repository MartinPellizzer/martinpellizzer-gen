    "intro": "Iridorkis recurva, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, often blooming during the cooler months. Iridorkis recurva thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
