It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Iberis stilosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
