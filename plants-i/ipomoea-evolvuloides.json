    "intro": "Ipomoea evolvuloides, commonly known as the wild morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
