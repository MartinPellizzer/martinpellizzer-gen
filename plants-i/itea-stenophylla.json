    "intro": "Itea stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, dark berries as fruits. Itea stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
