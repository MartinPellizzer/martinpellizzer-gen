    "intro": "Iris persica var. sieheana, commonly known as the Persian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in late May to early June. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its rhizomes are fibrous and somewhat succulent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is heightened by its elegant, tall flower stalks that rise above the foliage."
