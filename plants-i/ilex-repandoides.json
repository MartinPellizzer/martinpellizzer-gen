    "intro": "Ilex repandoides, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex repandoides thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild winters."
