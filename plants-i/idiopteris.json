    "intro": "Idiopteris, commonly known as the common hayscented fern, is a member of the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. Idiopteris thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
