It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.
