    "intro": "Ilex pedunculosa var. continentalis, commonly known as the European holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and features glossy, dark green leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice in gardens. The variety continentalis is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other holly species."
