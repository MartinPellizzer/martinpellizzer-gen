    "intro": "Iosanthus toxicarius, commonly known as the toxic sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that features fleshy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its toxic properties, as its sap contains irritants that can cause skin rashes. Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environments, it is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
