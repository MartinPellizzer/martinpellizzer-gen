    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. arbutifolia, commonly known as the common holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy, elliptical leaves with spiny margins, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Its evergreen appearance in winter provides seasonal interest and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
