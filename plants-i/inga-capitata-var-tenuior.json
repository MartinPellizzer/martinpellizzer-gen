    "intro": "Inga capitata var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and pinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited economic use compared to other Inga species."
