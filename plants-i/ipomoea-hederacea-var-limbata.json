It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in gardens."
