It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose, drooping cluster. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland grasslands. Isochilostachya caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
