    "intro": "Isoetes coromandelina subsp. coromandelina, commonly known as the Coromandel watermace, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically arranged in a rosette-like formation along the stem. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in Asia, particularly in regions such as India and Southeast Asia. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshy or pond environments. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important species in the study of aquatic botany."
