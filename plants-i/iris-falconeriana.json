    "intro": "Iris falconeriana, commonly known as the Falconer's iris, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive white or pale yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The leaves are sword-shaped, narrow, and often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating that reflects light."
