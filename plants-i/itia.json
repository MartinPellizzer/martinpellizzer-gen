    "intro": "Itia, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Itia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps retain moisture."
