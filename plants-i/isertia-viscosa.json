    "intro": "Isertia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky isertia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its stems and leaves exude a sticky resin, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Isertia viscosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
