    "intro": "Indigofera tinctoria var. brachycarpa, commonly known as dwarf indigo, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its most notable feature is the production of a deep blue dye from its seed pods, which has been historically used in textile industries. The variety brachycarpa is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other indigo species."
