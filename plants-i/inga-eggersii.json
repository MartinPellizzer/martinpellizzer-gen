    "intro": "Inga eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers's inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple leaflets, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Inga eggersii is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential ecological benefits in tropical ecosystems."
