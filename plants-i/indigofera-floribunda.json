It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a woody stem, making it a shrub-like species. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its profuse flowering and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
