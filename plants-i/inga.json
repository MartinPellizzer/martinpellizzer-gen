    "intro": "Inga, commonly known as the \"rainforest bean\" or \"silk tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Inga species typically have compound leaves and produce small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The fruit is a pod that contains edible seeds, often used in traditional cuisines. Many Inga species are also valued for their nitrogen-fixing ability, making them important in agroforestry systems."
