    "intro": "Ipomoea platensis var. subnovempartita, commonly known as the nine-parted morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly pubescent surface. The flowers are large, trumpet-shaped, and display a striking combination of white and purple hues, often with a prominent violet throat. It blooms throughout the growing season, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its nine distinct lobes on the leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"subnovempartita.\""
