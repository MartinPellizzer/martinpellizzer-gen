    "intro": "Ilex oblonga, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex oblonga is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
