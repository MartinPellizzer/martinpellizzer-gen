    "intro": "Isatis biscutellifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woad, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is valued for its historical use in dye production and as a potential medicinal plant."
