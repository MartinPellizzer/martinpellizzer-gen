It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are often blue-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is heightened by its long flowering period, which can last several weeks during the warmer months."
