It is characterized by its dimorphic spores, with distinct male and female spore forms, a feature common in many species of the genus. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually submerged, with a dark coloration that helps in absorbing light for photosynthesis. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
