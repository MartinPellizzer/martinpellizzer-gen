    "intro": "Ilex dioica, commonly known as the male and female evergreen holly, is a dioecious shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically spiny and alternate along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Female plants bear red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
