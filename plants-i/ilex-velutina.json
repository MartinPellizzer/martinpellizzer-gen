    "intro": "Ilex velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Ilex velutina is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
