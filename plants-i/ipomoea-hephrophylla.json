    "intro": "Ipomoea hephrophylla, commonly known as the golden morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and can grow as a vine or shrub depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped, with five petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ipomoea hephrophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
