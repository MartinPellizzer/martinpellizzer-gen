    "intro": "Iris rosenbachiana, commonly known as the Rosenbach iris, is a striking ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, spurred petals that resemble those of the bearded iris. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Iris rosenbachiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique beauty and hardiness."
