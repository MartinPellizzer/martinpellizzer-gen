    "intro": "Ilex tuerckheimii var. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features evergreen leaves that are glossy and lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
