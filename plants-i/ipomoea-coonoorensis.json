    "intro": "Ipomoea coonoorensis, commonly known as the Coonoor morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a climbing vine that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea coonoorensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine."
