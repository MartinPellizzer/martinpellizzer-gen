    "intro": "Inga corymbifera var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate arrangements, and its flowers are typically clustered in corymbs, giving it its species name. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests."
