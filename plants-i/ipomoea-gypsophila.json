    "intro": "Ipomoea gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in gypsum-rich environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its vines can grow up to several meters in length. Ipomoea gypsophila is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh, dry climates."
