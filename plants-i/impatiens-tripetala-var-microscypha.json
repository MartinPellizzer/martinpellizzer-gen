The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, and its stems are slender and often trailing. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
