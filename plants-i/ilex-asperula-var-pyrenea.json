    "intro": "Ilex asperula var. pyrenea, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used as a ornamental plant in gardens. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hedges or foundation plantings."
