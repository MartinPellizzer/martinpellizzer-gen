It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves are paired on either side of the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth, waxy surface. Ilysanthes oppositifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
