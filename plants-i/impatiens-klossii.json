    "intro": "Impatiens klossii, commonly known as Kloss's impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that come in a range of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with heart-shaped, glossy leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
