    "intro": "Ilex microwrightioides, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 feet, featuring dense, glossy dark green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Ilex microwrightioides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact growth."
