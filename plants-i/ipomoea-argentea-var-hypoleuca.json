    "intro": "Ipomoea argentea var. hypoleuca, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, blooming in the early morning. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, often using its tendrils to support itself on structures or other plants. The species is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered invasive in certain areas."
