    "intro": "Iris caurina, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in natural wetlands. The showy, sword-shaped leaves and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
