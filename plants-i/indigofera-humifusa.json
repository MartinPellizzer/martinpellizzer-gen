    "intro": "Indigofera humifusa, commonly known as dwarf indigo, is a low-growing perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions. It has a fibrous root system and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense growth habit. Additionally, it is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
