It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces upright, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
