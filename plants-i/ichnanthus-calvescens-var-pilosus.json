    "intro": "Ichnanthus calvescens var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy yellow iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow flowers with a prominent central ridge. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it forms dense stands. Its hairy texture, particularly on the leaves and stems, is a distinguishing characteristic of the variety. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
