    "intro": "Iva imbricata, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, roadsides, and wetlands. It has a creeping rootstock and produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds. Iva imbricata is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
