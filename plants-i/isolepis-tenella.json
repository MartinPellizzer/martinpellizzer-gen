    "intro": "Isolepis tenella, commonly known as the narrow spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats. Isolepis tenella is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
