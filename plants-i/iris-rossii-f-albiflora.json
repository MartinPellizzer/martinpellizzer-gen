    "intro": "Iris rossii f. albiflora, commonly known as the White-flowered Ross Iris, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale blue flowers with a distinctive violet-blue stripe down the center. The plant features tall, grass-like leaves and blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its limited natural habitat and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
