    "intro": "Ilex ligustrina var. minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces tiny white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for hedges or as a specimen plant."
