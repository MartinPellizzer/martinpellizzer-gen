    "intro": "Isolepis cartilaginea var. rigida, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically rigid and slightly hairy, adapted to its moist habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshes and pond edges. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
