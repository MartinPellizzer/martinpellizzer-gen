    "intro": "Ilex nothophoeboides, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex nothophoeboides is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dense foliage and seasonal color changes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
