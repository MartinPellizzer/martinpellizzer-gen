It features heart-shaped, pale green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, opening in the morning. Its flowering period occurs throughout the growing season, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Ipomoea gracilisepala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can climb supports using its twining stems."
