It is characterized by its large, round leaves that are elongated in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
