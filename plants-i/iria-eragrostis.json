    "intro": "Iria eragrostis, commonly known as rigid lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Iria eragrostis is valued for its use in livestock forage and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
