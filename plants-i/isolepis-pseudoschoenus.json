It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
