    "intro": "Iris pumila var. pseudopumilioides, commonly known as the dwarf iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear delicate, violet-blue to purple flowers with a distinctive spur. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often carpeting rocky or alpine slopes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, preferring cooler climates. This variety is notable for its compact size and early blooming habit, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
