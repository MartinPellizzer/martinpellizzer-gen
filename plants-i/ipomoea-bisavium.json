    "intro": "Ipomoea bisavium, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces distinctive, spherical seed pods that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
