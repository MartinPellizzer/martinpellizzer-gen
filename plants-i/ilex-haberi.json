    "intro": "Ilex haberi, commonly known as the Haber's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Ilex haberi is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in shaded environments."
