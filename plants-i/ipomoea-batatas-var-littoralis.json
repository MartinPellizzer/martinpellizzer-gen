It features thick, fleshy roots that store carbohydrates, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate saline conditions, making it suitable for coastal regions. It produces vibrant violet or purple flowers, which are often followed by orange or yellow tuberous roots. This variety is valued for its resilience and potential use in both ornamental and agricultural settings."
