    "intro": "Ilex domestica, commonly known as the common holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically spiny and have a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex domestica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial shade to full sun."
