    "intro": "Isoglossa, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish, are clustered in umbels and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Isoglossa species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. These plants are often found in woodland habitats and are known for their toxicity, containing compounds such as isoquinoline alkaloids."
