    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing showy, yellow flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a fan-like pattern. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed."
