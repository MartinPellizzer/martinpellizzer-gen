    "intro": "Isostigma hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a single, short-lived flower. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
