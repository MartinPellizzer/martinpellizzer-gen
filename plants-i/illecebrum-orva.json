    "intro": "Illecebrum orva, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features spreading, stoloniferous growth with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological research."
