    "intro": "Ixora heterophylla, commonly known as the variable ixora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, usually in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels and are surrounded by a ring of small, petal-like bracts. Ixora heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
