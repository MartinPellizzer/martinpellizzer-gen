    "intro": "Inga stipularis, commonly known as the yellow inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its rapid growth rate makes it a valuable species for agroforestry and reforestation projects. The plant also has a shallow root system, which helps in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in tropical ecosystems."
