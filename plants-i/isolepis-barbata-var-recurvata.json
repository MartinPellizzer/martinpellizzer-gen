    "intro": "Isolepis barbata var. recurvata, commonly known as the recurved tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often form dense tussocks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils. This variety is distinguished by its recurved leaf tips, giving it a unique appearance compared to other sedge species."
