    "intro": "Ilex maasiana, commonly known as Maas's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Ilex maasiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
