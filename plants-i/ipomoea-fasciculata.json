    "intro": "Ipomoea fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ipomoea fasciculata is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
