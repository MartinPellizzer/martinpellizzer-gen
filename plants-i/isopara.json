    "intro": "Isopara, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structure and is typically found in marine environments. Isopara thrives in shallow, tide-pool areas where it can absorb nutrients from the water. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released into the surrounding water to start new growth. Its simple morphology and rapid growth make it an important part of coastal ecosystems."
