    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 citriviola, commonly known as the lemon iris, is a hybrid perennial plant that combines traits from the bearded iris and the iris citriodora. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which resemble those of the lemon-scented iris, and its upright, sword-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is well-suited for gardens and landscapes due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements. Iris \u00d7 citriviola is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
