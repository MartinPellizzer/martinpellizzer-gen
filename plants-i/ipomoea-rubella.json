It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking red-orange flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, using its tendrils to support itself. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
