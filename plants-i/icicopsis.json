It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Icicopsis is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies."
