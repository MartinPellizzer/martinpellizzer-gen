    "intro": "Iris macrosiphon, commonly known as the giant iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to six feet. The plant produces showy, lavender-blue flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur at the base of each petal. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Iris macrosiphon is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks, where it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
