It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.
