    "intro": "Inga semicordata, commonly known as the red inga, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is distinguished by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests."
