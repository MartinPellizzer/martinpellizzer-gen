    "intro": "Iris pumila var. barthii, commonly known as the Barth's dwarf iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue to violet flowers in early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
