    "intro": "Inga rhoifolia, commonly known as the \"coffee tree,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Inga rhoifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
