    "intro": "Isodon calcicola var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lemongrass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves that contain high concentrations of essential oils, particularly citral, which gives it a strong lemon scent. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically short-lived. Due to its unique chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in local medicine for its antiseptic and digestive properties."
