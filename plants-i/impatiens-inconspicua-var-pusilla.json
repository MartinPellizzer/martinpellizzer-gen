    "intro": "Impatiens inconspicua var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf impatiens, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring delicate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and subtle appearance, it is a less commonly cultivated but ecologically significant species."
