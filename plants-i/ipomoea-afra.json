    "intro": "Ipomoea afra, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple, blue, and white. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its rapid growth and attractive flowers make it both ornamental and invasive in some regions. The seeds are dispersed by birds and can germinate quickly, contributing to its widespread distribution."
