    "intro": "Isoetes occidentalis, commonly known as the western water starwort, is a member of the genus Isoetes, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a central axis known as the strobilus. This plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it anchors itself in the substrate. Its leaves are usually dimorphic, with some being photosynthetic and others specialized for spore production. The plant's unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
