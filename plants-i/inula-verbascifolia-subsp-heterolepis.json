    "intro": "Inula verbascifolia subsp. heterolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with soft, grayish-green hairy foliage. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, arranged in a spherical cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a slightly rough texture, while the roots are thick and fleshy. This subspecies is often found in moist meadows and along streambanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
