It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The showy flowers bloom in late spring and are often used in traditional medicine and ornamental gardening."
