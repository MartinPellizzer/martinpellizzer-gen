    "intro": "Indigofera cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved indigo, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are typically pink to violet in color, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine and soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
