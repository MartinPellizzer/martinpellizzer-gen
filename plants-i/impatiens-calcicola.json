    "intro": "Impatiens calcicola, commonly known as the limestone impatiens, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to white. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well-adapted to dry conditions. Impatiens calcicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
