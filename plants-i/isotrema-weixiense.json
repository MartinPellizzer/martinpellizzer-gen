    "intro": "Isotrema weixiense, commonly known as the Weixi fern, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of China. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
