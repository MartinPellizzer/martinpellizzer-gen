It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring hairy, serrated margins on its leaves, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure typical of the orchid family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions for successful cultivation.
