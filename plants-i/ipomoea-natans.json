    "intro": "Ipomoea natans, commonly known as the water spinach or swamp morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its floating leaves that rest on the surface of water, with long, trailing stems that can spread across the water's surface. The plant produces small, pale purple or white flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. Its roots are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, while the leaves are also consumed as a vegetable. Ipomoea natans thrives in wetland environments and is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams."
