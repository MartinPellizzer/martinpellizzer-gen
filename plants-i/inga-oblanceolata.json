    "intro": "Inga oblanceolata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pink shower tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible, red, cherry-like fruits that are rich in nutrients and often consumed fresh or processed into jams. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for reforestation and soil enrichment. The species is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy floral display."
