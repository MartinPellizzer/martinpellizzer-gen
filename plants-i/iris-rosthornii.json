    "intro": "Iris rosthornii, commonly known as the Namib Desert iris, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, adapted to the extreme conditions of its habitat. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems with showy blue or violet flowers. Its blooming period typically occurs during the rainy season, adding a splash of color to the otherwise barren landscape. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native environment."
