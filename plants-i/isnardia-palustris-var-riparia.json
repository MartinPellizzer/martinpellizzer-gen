    "intro": "Isnardia palustris var. riparia, commonly known as the riparian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
