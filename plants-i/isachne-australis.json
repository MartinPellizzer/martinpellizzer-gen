    "intro": "Isachne australis, commonly known as the Australian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Isachne australis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
