    "intro": "Ianthe monophylla, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, white, ghost-like blooms that appear in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, scale-like leaves and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
