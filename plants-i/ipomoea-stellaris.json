    "intro": "Ipomoea stellaris, commonly known as the star morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, with five petals and a distinctive central cluster of stamens. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along fences, walls, or in garden beds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its vines can reach lengths of several meters. Ipomoea stellaris blooms in the early morning, hence its common name, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
