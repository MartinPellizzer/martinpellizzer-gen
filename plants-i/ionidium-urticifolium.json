    "intro": "Ionidium urticifolium, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its serrated, hollow stems and heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures that release an irritating substance. The plant belongs to the family Urticaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and greenish, typically appearing in clusters, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators. Despite its defensive properties, it has been used historically for its nutritional and medicinal properties."
