    "intro": "Inga uncinata, commonly known as the hooked inga, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with hairy appendages, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Inga uncinata plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root system."
