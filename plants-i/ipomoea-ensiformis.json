    "intro": "Ipomoea ensiformis, commonly known as the arrowleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a vigorous vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, with heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woods. Ipomoea ensiformis is also known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
