    "intro": "Ixeridium aculeolatum, commonly known as the spiny centipede grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy ornamental and turfgrass species. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress weed growth."
