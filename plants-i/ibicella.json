    "intro": "Ibicella, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Nyctaginaceae. It is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves, which help it thrive in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in pink or purple hues. Ibicella plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
