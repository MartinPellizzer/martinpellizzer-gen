    "intro": "Indigofera grandifoliola, commonly known as the large-leaf indigo plant, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces long, slender pods containing small, dark seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
