    "intro": "Ipomoea dasyclada, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the morning. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Ipomoea dasyclada is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but can become invasive in certain environments."
