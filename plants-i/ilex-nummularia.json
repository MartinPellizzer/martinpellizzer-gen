    "intro": "Ilex nummularia, commonly known as the silver mohave or dollar tree, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features dense, rounded foliage composed of small, leathery, silver-gray leaves that are about 1 inch in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a versatile plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
