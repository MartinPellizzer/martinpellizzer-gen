It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Ipomoea canescens is also notable for its fibrous roots, which have been used in traditional medicine."
