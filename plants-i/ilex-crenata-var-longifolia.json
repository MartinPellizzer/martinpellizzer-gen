    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. longifolia, commonly known as Japanese holly or Japanese yew, is a dense, evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact foliage. Ilex crenata var. longifolia is well-suited for hedges, topiaries, and rock gardens due to its slow growth and adaptability."
