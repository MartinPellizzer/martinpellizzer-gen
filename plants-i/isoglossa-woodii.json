    "intro": "Isoglossa woodii, commonly known as the Wood's isoglossa, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isoglossa woodii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
