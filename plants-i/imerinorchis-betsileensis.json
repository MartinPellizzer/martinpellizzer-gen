    "intro": "Imerinorchis betsileensis, commonly known as the Betsilean orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually small and have a distinctive coloration, often featuring shades of white and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Imerinorchis betsileensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
