    "intro": "Iris zaprjagajevii, commonly known as the Zaprjagajev's iris, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
