It is a leguminous shrub characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Its seeds produce a deep blue dye historically used in textile industries. This variety is distinguished by its larger seed pods compared to other indigo species."
