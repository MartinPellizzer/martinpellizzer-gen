    "intro": "Imhofia tenella, commonly known as the dwarf arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color, followed by edible tubers that resemble those of arrowroot. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Imhofia tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential as a food source in certain regions."
