    "intro": "Isolepis sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globular bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Isolepis sphaerocarpa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
