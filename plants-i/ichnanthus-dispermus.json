    "intro": "Ichnanthus dispermus, commonly known as the two-seeded ichnanthus, is a small flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces two seeds per fruit, a unique feature that distinguishes it from many other members of its family. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
