    "intro": "Iresine nitens, commonly known as the red leaf iron plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, bi-colored leaves that range from deep red to dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, which appear in clusters along the stems. Iresine nitens thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
