    "intro": "Ipomoea pachypus, commonly known as the thick-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, thick, and waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its vines can grow up to several meters long, climbing or trailing along supports. Ipomoea pachypus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
