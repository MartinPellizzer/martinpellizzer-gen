    "intro": "Iris pallida subsp. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Italy. It features striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and scrub habitats. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and slightly hairy, while its rhizomes are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other iris species."
