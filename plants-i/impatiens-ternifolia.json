    "intro": "Impatiens ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf jewelweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Impatiens ternifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks."
