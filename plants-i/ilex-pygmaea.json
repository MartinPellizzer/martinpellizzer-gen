    "intro": "Ilex pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only 1 to 3 feet, making it an ideal plant for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Ilex pygmaea is well-suited for USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9 and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun."
