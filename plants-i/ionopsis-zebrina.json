    "intro": "Ionopsis zebrina, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure. It features a striking, colorful spathe that surrounds a central spadix, which is typical of many aroid plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers within the spadix, which are pollinated by insects. Ionopsis zebrina is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its foliage is usually dark green with a waxy texture, making it an attractive addition to indoor gardens."
