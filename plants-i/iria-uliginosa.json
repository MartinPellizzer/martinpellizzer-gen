    "intro": "Iria uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Iria uliginosa is known for its adaptability to waterlogged conditions and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
