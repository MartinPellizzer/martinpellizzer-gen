It is a herbaceous vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a desirable garden plant and an invasive species in some areas."
