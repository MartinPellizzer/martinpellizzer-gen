    "intro": "Itea indochinensis var. pubinervia, commonly known as the pubescent-veined water-plantain, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems that often grow in wet or marshy environments. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they have prominent, pubescent veins that give the plant its varietal name. The flowers are small and white, arranged in spikes, and are typically borne on slender pedicels. This plant is often found in freshwater habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
