    "intro": "Ichnanthus angustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf twayblade, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces tiny, tuber-like structures for storage. Ichnanthus angustus is a non-photosynthetic plant, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
