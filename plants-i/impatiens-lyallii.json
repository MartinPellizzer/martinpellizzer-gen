    "intro": "Impatiens lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that come in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. Impatiens lyallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
