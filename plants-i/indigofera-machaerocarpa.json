    "intro": "Indigofera machaerocarpa, commonly known as the rock indigo, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several elliptical seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Indigofera machaerocarpa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
