    "intro": "Isachne altissima, commonly known as tall isachne, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and riparian zones. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Isachne altissima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
