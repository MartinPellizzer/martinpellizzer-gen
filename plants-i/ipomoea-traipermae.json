    "intro": "Ipomoea traipermae, commonly known as the Traiperm's morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and has a climbing habit, often twining around supports. Its flowers open in the morning and close by late afternoon, a trait typical of many morning glory species. Ipomoea traipermae is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
