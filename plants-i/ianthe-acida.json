    "intro": "Ianthe acida, commonly known as the sour thorn, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its sharp, spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ianthe acida thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its acidic sap contributes to its common name and can cause skin irritation upon contact."
