    "intro": "Inga flexuosa, commonly known as the \"banana tree of the Amazon,\" is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is a fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant has compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing pods that contain edible seeds. Inga flexuosa also plays an important role in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
