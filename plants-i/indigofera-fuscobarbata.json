    "intro": "Indigofera fuscobarbata, commonly known as the dark-barbed indigo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pods that contain small, dark seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can contribute to soil fertility in agricultural settings."
