It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as achene. Inula somalensis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along rocky outcrops."
