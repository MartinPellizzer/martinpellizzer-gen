    "intro": "Isolepis prolifera, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense mats through its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Isolepis prolifera is valued for its ability to stabilize shorelines and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting diverse aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
