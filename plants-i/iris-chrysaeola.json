    "intro": "Iris chrysaeola, commonly known as the golden iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive dark central stripe. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
