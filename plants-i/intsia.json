    "intro": "Intsia, commonly known as ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These trees are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they have small leaflets arranged in pairs along the stem. Intsia species often grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
