It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and features narrow, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. Iris \u00d7 fulvala thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens and pond edges."
