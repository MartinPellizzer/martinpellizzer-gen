    "intro": "Inga vera subsp. affinis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pink shower tree, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, round pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
