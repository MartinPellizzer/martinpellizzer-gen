    "intro": "Impatiens cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinated and remain closed, while the open flowers are typically pollinated by insects. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
