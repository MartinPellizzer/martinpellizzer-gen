    "intro": "Indigofera filifolia, commonly known as the silky indigo, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces vibrant purple to blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in elongated, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Indigofera filifolia is also valued for its historical use in natural dye production."
