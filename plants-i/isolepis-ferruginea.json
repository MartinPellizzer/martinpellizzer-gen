    "intro": "Isolepis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Isolepis ferruginea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms."
