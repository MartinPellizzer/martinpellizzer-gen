    "intro": "Idiopappus quitensis, commonly known as the Andean burweed, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called achenes, which are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Its foliage is typically hairy and adapted to the cold, high-altitude environment. Idiopappus quitensis is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
