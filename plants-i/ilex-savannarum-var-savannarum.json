    "intro": "Ilex savannarum var. savannarum, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, featuring dense, glossy green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
