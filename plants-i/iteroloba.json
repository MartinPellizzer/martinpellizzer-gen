    "intro": "Iteroloba, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, colorful bracts that resemble butterfly wings, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plants typically have palmate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in inflorescences. Iteroloba species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They thrive in warm, humid climates and require well-drained soil for optimal growth."
