    "intro": "Impatiens sarissiformis, commonly known as the swordleaf impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that typically range from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Impatiens sarissiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
