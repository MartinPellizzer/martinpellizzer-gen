    "intro": "Illicium floridanum, commonly known as the Florida anise, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by dark blue berries. The plant has aromatic leaves and fruits that contain essential oils, contributing to its distinctive scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and swamps. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
