    "intro": "Indigofera sericophylla, commonly known as velvetleaf indigo, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which have a velvety texture due to fine hairs covering the surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is native to parts of Asia and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or as a forage plant."
