    "intro": "Iriartea, commonly known as the cycad, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cycadaceae. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. Iriartea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. They are often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plants have a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Mesozoic era, and are considered living fossils."
