    "intro": "Ichnanthus ruprechtii, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in wetland environments. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to the ecological health of its habitat. Ichnanthus ruprechtii is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
