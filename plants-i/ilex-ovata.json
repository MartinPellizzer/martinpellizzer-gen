    "intro": "Ilex ovata, commonly known as the Japanese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex ovata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its hardiness and attractive appearance make it a valued addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
