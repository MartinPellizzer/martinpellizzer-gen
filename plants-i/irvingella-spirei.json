It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or red. Irvingella spirei is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
