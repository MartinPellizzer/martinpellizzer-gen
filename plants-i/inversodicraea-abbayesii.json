It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and thorny stems. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with small leaves that reduce water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
