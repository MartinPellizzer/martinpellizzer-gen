The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet environments and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it an important plant for studying wetland ecosystems and grassland biodiversity."
