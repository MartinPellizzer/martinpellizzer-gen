    "intro": "Ixeris japonica, commonly known as Japanese carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Ixeris japonica is known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain environments."
