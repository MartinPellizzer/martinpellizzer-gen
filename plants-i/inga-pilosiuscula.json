    "intro": "Inga pilosiuscula, commonly known as the silky inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its fast growth rate makes it a useful species for reforestation and agroforestry projects."
