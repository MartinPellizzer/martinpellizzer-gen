    "intro": "Ilex radicans, commonly known as the creeping winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, cascading growth habit and its striking red berries that appear in the winter. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its berries provide an important food source for birds and other wildlife during the colder months."
