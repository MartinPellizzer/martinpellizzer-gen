It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
