It is characterized by its hairy, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the early morning. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Ipomoea lachnaea is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
