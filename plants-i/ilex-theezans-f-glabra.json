    "intro": "Ilex theezans f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental planting in gardens. The shrub has a dense, compact growth habit and is often used for hedges or as a specimen plant."
