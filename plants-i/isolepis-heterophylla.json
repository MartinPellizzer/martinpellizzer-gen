    "intro": "Isolepis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Australia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often subtended by bracts, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, playing a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Its variability in leaf shape and size contributes to its common name and ecological adaptability."
