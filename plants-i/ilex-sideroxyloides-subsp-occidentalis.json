    "intro": "Ilex sideroxyloides subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically leathery and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to other Ilex species."
