    "intro": "Ipomoea rumphii, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its rapid growth habit and ornamental flowers make it popular in gardens, though it can become invasive in some environments. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red berry that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals."
