    "intro": "Ilex crenata f. microphylla, commonly known as Japanese holly or dwarf Japanese holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically a glossy dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is valued for its dense, bushy growth habit and is often used in landscape design for its ornamental appeal. This variety is more compact than the standard Ilex crenata, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant."
