    "intro": "Iberis carnosa subsp. lagascana, commonly known as the Spanish rockcress, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant features compact, mat-forming growth with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are small, lobed, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
