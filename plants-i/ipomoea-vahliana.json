    "intro": "Ipomoea vahliana, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oblong seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
