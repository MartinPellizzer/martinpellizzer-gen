    "intro": "Isotrema tadungense, commonly known as the Tadung rock fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and intricate rhizome system. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its fronds are usually small and leathery, with a distinctive, serrated margin that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isotrema tadungense is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
