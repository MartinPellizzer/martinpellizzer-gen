    "intro": "Ictodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, thin roots and a single, showy flower that is usually white or pale green. Ictodes thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of old-growth forests. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species."
