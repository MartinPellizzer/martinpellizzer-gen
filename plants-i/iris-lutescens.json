    "intro": "Iris lutescens, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a species native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and grow in dense clusters. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, making it a common sight in marshes and along riverbanks. However, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
