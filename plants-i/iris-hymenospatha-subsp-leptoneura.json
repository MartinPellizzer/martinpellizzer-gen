    "intro": "Iris hymenospatha subsp. leptoneura, commonly known as the slender-veined iris, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive white or pale yellow center. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender leaf veins and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other iris species."
