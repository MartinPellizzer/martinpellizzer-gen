    "intro": "Ipomoea trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the Caribbean. It produces strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a trumpet-shaped form. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found growing along coastal areas and in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a common ornamental plant in tropical regions. The species is also known for its short blooming period, typically in the early morning, hence its common name."
