    "intro": "Ilex vomitoria f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping inkberry, is a cultivar of the evergreen holly species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. Its dense, glossy foliage provides year-round visual interest and makes it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sun for optimal growth."
