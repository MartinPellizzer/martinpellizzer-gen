It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green markings. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and hanging baskets."
