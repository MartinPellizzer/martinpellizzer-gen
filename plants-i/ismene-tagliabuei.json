    "intro": "Ismene tagliabuei, commonly known as the Tagliabue's ismene, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ismene tagliabuei is considered a species of conservation concern."
