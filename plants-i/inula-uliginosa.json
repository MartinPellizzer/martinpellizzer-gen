    "intro": "Inula uliginosa, commonly known as yellow cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Inula uliginosa plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
