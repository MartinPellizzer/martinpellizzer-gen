    "intro": "Iris sisyrinchium var. fugax, commonly known as the transient iris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant characterized by its slender stems and striking blue-violet flowers. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is native to specific regions in North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with its petals resembling those of true irises, though it is botanically classified as a member of the genus Iris. Its ephemeral nature, both in growth cycle and bloom time, contributes to its common name, reflecting its fleeting presence in the ecosystem. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
