    "intro": "Ilex percoriacea, commonly known as the smoothleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Ilex percoriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
