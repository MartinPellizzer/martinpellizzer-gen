    "intro": "Illecebrum polygonoides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and an invasive species in some areas."
