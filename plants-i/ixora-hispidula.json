    "intro": "Ixora hispidula, commonly known as the rough ixora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers, which are borne on long, slender peduncles. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Ixora hispidula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
