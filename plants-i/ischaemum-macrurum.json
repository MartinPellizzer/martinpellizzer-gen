It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, linear leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Ischaemum macrurum plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
