    "intro": "Ipomoea velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a common weed in agricultural fields."
