    "intro": "Ilex teratopis, commonly known as the twisted holly, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, twisted growth pattern, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are typically clustered in whorls along its stems. Its small, red berries are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex teratopis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
