    "intro": "Ilex tadiandamolensis, commonly known as the Tadiandamol holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution."
