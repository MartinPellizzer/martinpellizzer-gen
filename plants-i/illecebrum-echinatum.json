It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features slender, climbing stems with spiny nodes, and its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a weed and a subject of ecological study."
