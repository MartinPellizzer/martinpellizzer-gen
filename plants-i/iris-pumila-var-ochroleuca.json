    "intro": "Iris pumila var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white woodland iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches a height of 6 to 12 inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense clump. The plant produces delicate, nodding flowers in shades of white to pale blue, often with a yellowish throat. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. This variety is characterized by its small size and subtle floral coloration, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
