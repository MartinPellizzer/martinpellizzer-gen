    "intro": "Ilex flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, arching growth habit and its striking red berries that persist through the winter. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall before dropping. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, particularly in areas with wet soil conditions."
