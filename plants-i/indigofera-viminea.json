It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically blue or purple, and it produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. Indigofera viminea is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye due to its rich pigment content."
