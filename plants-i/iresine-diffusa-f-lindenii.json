It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety red or pink bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle contrast to the showy bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sun for optimal growth. Its foliage is often variegated, with a mix of green and reddish tones, enhancing its ornamental value in gardens."
