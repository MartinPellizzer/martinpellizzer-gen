    "intro": "Iris ensata var. spontanea, commonly known as the Japanese water iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves and produces showy, lavender-blue flowers with a distinctive three-dimensional structure. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize waterlogged soils effectively. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in wetland habitats."
