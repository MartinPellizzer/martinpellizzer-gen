    "intro": "Ilex editicostata var. litseifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
