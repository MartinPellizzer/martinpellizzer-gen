    "intro": "Ixia bulbocodioides, commonly known as the yellow ox tongue, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features showy, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact, grass-like foliage that grows from a basal rosette of narrow leaves. Its bulbous structure stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated in gardens for its striking, long-lasting blooms."
