    "intro": "Iris versicolor var. communis, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense stands. The leaves are sword-shaped, narrow, and often have a slight waxy coating, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
