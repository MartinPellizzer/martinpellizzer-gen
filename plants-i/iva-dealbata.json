    "intro": "Iva dealbata, commonly known as the white cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is an annual herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring lobed leaves and spiny, spherical fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, prickly seed capsules. Iva dealbata is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can become invasive. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
