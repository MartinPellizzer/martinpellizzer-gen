    "intro": "Iris lilacina, commonly known as the lilac iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The iris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
