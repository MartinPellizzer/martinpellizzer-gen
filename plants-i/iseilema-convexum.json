    "intro": "Iseilema convexum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow water and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. Iseilema convexum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shade for various aquatic organisms."
