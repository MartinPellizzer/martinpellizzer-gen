    "intro": "Illecebrum verticillatum, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils along stream banks and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
