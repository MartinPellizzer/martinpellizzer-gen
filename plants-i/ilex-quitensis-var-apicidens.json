    "intro": "Ilex quitensis var. apicidens, commonly known as the Andean holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
