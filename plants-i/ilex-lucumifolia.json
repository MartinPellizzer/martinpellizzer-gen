    "intro": "Ilex lucumifolia, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Ilex lucumifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation in wetland environments."
