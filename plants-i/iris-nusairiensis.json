It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
