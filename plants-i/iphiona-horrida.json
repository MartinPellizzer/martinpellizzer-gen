    "intro": "Iphiona horrida, commonly known as the horrid iphiona, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought periods. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Iphiona horrida is also notable for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by local communities for treating various ailments."
