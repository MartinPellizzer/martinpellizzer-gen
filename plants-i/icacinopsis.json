It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically showy, with clusters of small, tubular blooms that range in color from yellow to orange. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils due to their adaptability and rapid growth."
