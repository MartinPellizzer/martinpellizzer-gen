    "intro": "Illicium guajaibonense, commonly known as the Guajibonense star anise, is a species of flowering plant in the family Schisandraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the star anise (Illicium verum). Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while the flowers are small and greenish-white in color. Illicium guajaibonense is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties, though it remains less studied compared to its more commercially known relatives."
