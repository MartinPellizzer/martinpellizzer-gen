    "intro": "Ixeris nikoensis, commonly known as Niko's carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Japan. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Ixeris nikoensis is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodland floors and stream banks."
