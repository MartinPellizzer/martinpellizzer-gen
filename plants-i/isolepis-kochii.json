    "intro": "Isolepis kochii, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence and is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Isolepis kochii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience in wet environments."
