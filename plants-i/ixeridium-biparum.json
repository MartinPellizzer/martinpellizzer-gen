    "intro": "Ixeridium biparum, commonly known as the two-branched fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that often have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Ixeridium biparum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
