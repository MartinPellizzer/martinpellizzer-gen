    "intro": "Isomeris aborea, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Isomeris aborea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
