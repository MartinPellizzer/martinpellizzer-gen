    "intro": "Ischnosiphon colombianus, commonly known as the Colombian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds through wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
