    "intro": "Iris foetidissima var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in many regions. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often forming dense colonies that can dominate wetland ecosystems."
