    "intro": "Isometrum villosum, commonly known as the silky isometrum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall textured foliage. Isometrum villosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
