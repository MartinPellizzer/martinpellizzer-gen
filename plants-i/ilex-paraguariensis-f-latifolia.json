    "intro": "Ilex paraguariensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved yerba mate, is a variant of the yerba mate plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and is typically found in the subtropical regions of Paraguay and Brazil. The plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. Its leaves are used to prepare the traditional South American beverage known as mate. The botanical features of this form make it distinct from the standard Ilex paraguariensis, particularly in leaf morphology and growth habit."
