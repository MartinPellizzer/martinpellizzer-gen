    "intro": "Incarvillea variabilis var. przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's incarvillea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
