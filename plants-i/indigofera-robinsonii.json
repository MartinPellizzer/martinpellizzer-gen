It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
