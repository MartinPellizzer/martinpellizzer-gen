    "intro": "Ionidium durum, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a resilient shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, woody stems that are highly resistant to drought and extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, angular seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Ionidium durum plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert wildlife species."
