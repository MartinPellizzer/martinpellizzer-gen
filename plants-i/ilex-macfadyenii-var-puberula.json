It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a pubescent texture. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
