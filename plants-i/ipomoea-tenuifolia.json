    "intro": "Ipomoea tenuifolia, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has thin, trailing stems that can spread rapidly, making it both ornamental and invasive in some areas. Its flowers are typically 2\u20135 cm in length and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and gardens."
