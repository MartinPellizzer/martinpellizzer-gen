    "intro": "Ionidium rivale, commonly known as the river orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found near streams or in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ionidium rivale is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
