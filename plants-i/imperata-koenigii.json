    "intro": "Imperata koenigii, commonly known as cinnamon grass, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily in moist, well-drained soils. Cinnamon grass is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
