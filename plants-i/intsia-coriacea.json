    "intro": "Intsia coriacea, commonly known as ironwood or African teak, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has a straight trunk with a smooth, dark-brown to black bark that is often fissured. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The small, pale yellow flowers are followed by woody pods containing several seeds."
