    "intro": "Isoetes velata subsp. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed water shield, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporocarps, are distinctive and help in its reproduction. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to low-light conditions."
