    "intro": "Ichthyothere woodii, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plumbaginaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which reflect its adaptation to coastal environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions, while its deep root system stabilizes dune ecosystems. Ichthyothere woodii is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
