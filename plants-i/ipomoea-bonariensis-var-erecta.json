    "intro": "Ipomoea bonariensis var. erecta, commonly known as the climbing morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pale blue, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and along fences."
