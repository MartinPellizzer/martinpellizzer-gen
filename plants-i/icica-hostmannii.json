    "intro": "Icica hostmannii, commonly known as the Hostmann's icica, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with narrow, silvery-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in dense clusters, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Icica hostmannii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
