    "intro": "Ilex subcordata f. nummularioides, commonly known as the Nummularioides holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its slow growth and dense foliage. Its unique leaf shape and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
