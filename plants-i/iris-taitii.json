    "intro": "Iris taitii, commonly known as the Tahiti iris, is a striking plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its large, showy blue-violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
