    "intro": "Inga ilta, commonly known as the white inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, and it is often found in humid lowland forests. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of secondary forest regeneration."
