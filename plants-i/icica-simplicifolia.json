    "intro": "Icica simplicifolia, commonly known as the simpleleaf icica, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its slender stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are followed by small, dry fruits. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often used in xeriscaping and traditional medicine."
