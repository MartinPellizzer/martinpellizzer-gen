    "intro": "Indigofera pilosa var. multiflora, commonly known as the hairy indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often arranged in clusters. It is a legume, meaning it belongs to the Fabaceae family, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria. This makes it useful in agricultural settings for soil enrichment."
