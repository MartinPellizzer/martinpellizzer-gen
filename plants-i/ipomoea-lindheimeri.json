    "intro": "Ipomoea lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea lindheimeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
