    "intro": "Iaravaea aquatica, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to prevent water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pink and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Iaravaea aquatica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
