    "intro": "Isachne, commonly known as the \"false brome,\" is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their fine, tufted growth habit. Isachne species often have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spikelet-based flowers. They are often used in landscaping due to their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements. Some species are also valued for their role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
