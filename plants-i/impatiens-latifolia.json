It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures. Impatiens latifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
