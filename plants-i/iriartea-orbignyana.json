    "intro": "Iriartea orbignyana, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a thick, unbranched trunk that develops as it matures, often covered in a rough, fibrous bark. Its cones, which are typically yellowish-green, are used for propagation and are an important feature in its reproductive cycle. Iriartea orbignyana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
