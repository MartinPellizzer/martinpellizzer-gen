    "intro": "Indigofera elatior var. dumosa, commonly known as the dwarf indigo, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fibrous roots and nitrogen-fixing capabilities make it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
