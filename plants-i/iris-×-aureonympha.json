    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 aureonympha, commonly known as the golden iris, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Iris sibirica and Iris \u00d7 germanica. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to golden orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are dark green and sturdy. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for garden borders and water features. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their striking color and long-lasting blooms."
