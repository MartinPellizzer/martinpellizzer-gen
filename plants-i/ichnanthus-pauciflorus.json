    "intro": "Ichnanthus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered ichnanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Ichnanthus pauciflorus plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and supporting biodiversity."
