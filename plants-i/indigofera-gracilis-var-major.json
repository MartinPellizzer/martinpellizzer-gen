    "intro": "Indigofera gracilis var. major, commonly known as the slender indigo or slender cowpea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has a climbing habit and can produce small, edible pods, though it is more valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it useful in soil enrichment and as a cover crop."
