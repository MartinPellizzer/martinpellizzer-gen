    "intro": "Illecebrum divaricatum, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue, often opening in the morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
