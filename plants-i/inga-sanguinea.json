    "intro": "Inga sanguinea, commonly known as the red inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth, compound leaves, and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that contains several seeds. Inga sanguinea is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
