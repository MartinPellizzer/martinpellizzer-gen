    "intro": "Isatis bitlisica, commonly known as the Turkish woad, is a perennial herb native to Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Isatis bitlisica has been historically used for its dye-producing properties, similar to its more famous relative, the common woad."
