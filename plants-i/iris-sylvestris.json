    "intro": "Iris sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright, sword-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Iris sylvestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant blooms."
