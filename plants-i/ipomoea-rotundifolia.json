    "intro": "Ipomoea rotundifolia, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by afternoon. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that help it ascend supports. It produces blue, purple, or white flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature. Ipomoea rotundifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
