    "intro": "Ischaemum glabrum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairless. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its native range."
