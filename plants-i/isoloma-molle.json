    "intro": "Isoloma molle, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central column. Isoloma molle thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an attractive ornamental plant, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
