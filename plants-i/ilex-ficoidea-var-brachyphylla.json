    "intro": "Ilex ficoidea var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf persimmon holly, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its dense foliage and seasonal color changes. This variety is noted for its slow growth and ability to tolerate partial shade."
