    "intro": "Ilex ligustrina f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved holly, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically no larger than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are ornamental and attract wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and winter hardiness make it suitable for a variety of garden settings."
