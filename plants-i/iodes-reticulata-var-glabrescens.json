    "intro": "Iodes reticulata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth nettle, is a variant of the nettle family (Urticaceae) characterized by its reduced pubescence. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside, though the variant is noted for its smoother texture. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are usually wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and as a food source for certain herbivores."
