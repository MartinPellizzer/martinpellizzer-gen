    "intro": "Isolepis gracillima, commonly known as slender tussock sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late summer. Isolepis gracillima thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats."
