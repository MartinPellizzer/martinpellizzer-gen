It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannah and woodland habitats. While not widely cultivated for commercial purposes, it holds ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
