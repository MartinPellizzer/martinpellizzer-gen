    "intro": "Isolepis setacea, commonly known as the tufted spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. Its slender, cylindrical stems are covered in stiff, bristle-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Isolepis setacea produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are often concealed by the dense foliage."
