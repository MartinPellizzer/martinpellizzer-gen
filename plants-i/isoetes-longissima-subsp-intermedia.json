    "intro": "Isoetes longissima subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water horsetail, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and small, spore-bearing cones. This subspecies is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and wetlands. Its morphology includes whorls of small, needle-like leaves along the stem. The plant plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique reproductive structures."
