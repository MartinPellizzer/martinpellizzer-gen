    "intro": "Inga tergemina, commonly known as the \"white inga,\" is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, elliptical leaflets and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the forest understory. Inga tergemina is often found in moist, shaded environments and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
