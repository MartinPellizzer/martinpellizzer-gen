    "intro": "Indigofera conferta, commonly known as the woolly indigo, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules makes it valuable in soil enrichment. The plant is also appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
