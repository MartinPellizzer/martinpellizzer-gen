It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. The species is notable for its historical use in producing indigo dye, similar to its more widely known relative, Isatis tinctoria."
