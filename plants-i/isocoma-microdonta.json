    "intro": "Isocoma microdonta, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
