    "intro": "Ischaemum sunilii, commonly known as the Sunil's grass, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed florets, typical of the genus Ischaemum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ischaemum sunilii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
