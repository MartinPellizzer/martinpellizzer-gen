    "intro": "Indigofera nematopoda, commonly known as the African indigo plant, is a leguminous shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pods containing small, dark seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in agricultural settings."
