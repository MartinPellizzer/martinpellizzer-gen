    "intro": "Isolepis alpina, commonly known as the alpine flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates. Isolepis alpina plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration."
