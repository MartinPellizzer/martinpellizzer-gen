    "intro": "Iris pumila var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded dwarf iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue to purple flowers with three upright petals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The varietal name \"macrocarpa\" refers to its larger seed capsules compared to the typical variety."
