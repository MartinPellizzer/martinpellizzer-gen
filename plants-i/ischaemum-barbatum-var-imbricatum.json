    "intro": "Ischaemum barbatum var. imbricatum, commonly known as the hairy grass or bristly grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks. This variant is distinguished by its imbricate (overlapping) leaf arrangement, which gives it its specific name."
