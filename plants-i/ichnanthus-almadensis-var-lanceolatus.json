    "intro": "Ichnanthus almadensis var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
