    "intro": "Ischaemum bombaiense, commonly known as the Bombay grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, riverbanks, and floodplains. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
