    "intro": "Iris helena, commonly known as the Helena iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often adorned with a distinct yellow or white stripe along the inner edges. Iris helena thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
