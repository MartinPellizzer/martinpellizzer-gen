    "intro": "Ipomoea venosa var. obtusifoliola, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green color and a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
