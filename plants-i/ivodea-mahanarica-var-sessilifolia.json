    "intro": "Ivodea mahanarica var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the Mahanarica ivy, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
