    "intro": "Indigofera, commonly known as the indigo plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and are characterized by their compound leaves and small, often fragrant flowers. Many species of Indigofera are cultivated for their ability to produce a deep blue dye, historically used in textile industries. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it an important crop for soil enrichment. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
