    "intro": "Icma involucrata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that shelters its reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms during the spring season. Due to its habitat specificity, Icma involucrata is considered a rare and endangered species."
