    "intro": "Ilex \u00d7 fauriei var. rugosa, commonly known as the Japanese holly or roughleaf holly, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which is typically dark green with a rough, textured surface. The leaves are usually elliptical to ovate in shape and have a distinctive, slightly wavy margin. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its year-round foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
