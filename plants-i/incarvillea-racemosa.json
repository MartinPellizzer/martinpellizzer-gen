    "intro": "Incarvillea racemosa, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant's fibrous roots enable it to survive in poor soil and withstand periods of drought."
