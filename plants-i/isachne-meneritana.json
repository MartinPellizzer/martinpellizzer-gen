    "intro": "Isachne meneritana, commonly known as the slender grass or narrow-leaved rice grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and rice fields, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Isachne meneritana has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
