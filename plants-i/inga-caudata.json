    "intro": "Inga caudata, commonly known as the \"silk cotton tree\" or \"chocolate tree,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, with numerous small leaflets. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds enclosed in silky, cotton-like fibers. Inga caudata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
