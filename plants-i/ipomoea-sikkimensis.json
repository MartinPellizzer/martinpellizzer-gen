    "intro": "Ipomoea sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
