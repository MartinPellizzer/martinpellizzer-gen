It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
