It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by birds and mammals. Inga psittacorum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important component of agroforestry systems. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
