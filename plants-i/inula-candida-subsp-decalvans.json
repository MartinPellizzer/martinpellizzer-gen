It is characterized by its showy, yellow-centered composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The subspecies decalvans is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs compared to other subspecies of Inula candida."
