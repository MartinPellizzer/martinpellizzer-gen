    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus var. longifolia, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a striking wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
