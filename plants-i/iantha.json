    "intro": "Iantha, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue, often with a prominent central disk. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, across eastern North America. Iantha has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
