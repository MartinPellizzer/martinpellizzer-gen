    "intro": "Inga foetida, commonly known as the stinking acacia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate, and its distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Inga foetida is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
