    "intro": "Ilex amboroica, commonly known as the Ambor\u00f3 holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red berries that are often consumed by local wildlife. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Ilex amboroica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
