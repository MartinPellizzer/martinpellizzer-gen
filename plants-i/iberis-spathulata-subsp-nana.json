    "intro": "Iberis spathulata subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, lobed leaves that are slightly hairy, and it typically reaches a height of only a few inches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers make it a valuable addition to alpine and Mediterranean-style gardens."
