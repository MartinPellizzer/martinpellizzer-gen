    "intro": "Inula acaulis subsp. acaulis, commonly known as the barrenwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a single terminal head. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
