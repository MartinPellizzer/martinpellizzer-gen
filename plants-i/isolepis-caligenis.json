    "intro": "Isolepis caligenis, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Micropteris. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form compact, cushion-like structures, typically growing in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the foliage, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Isolepis caligenis is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of peatland ecosystems."
