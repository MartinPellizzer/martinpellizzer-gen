    "intro": "Ipomoea rubens, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange in color, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are usually light green and velvety in texture. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Ipomoea rubens is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
