    "intro": "Isoetes muricata subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea spike moss, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. This subspecies typically grows in brackish or marine environments, such as salt marshes and coastal areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, adapted to withstand saline conditions. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
