    "intro": "Impatientella inaperta var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled impatient plant, is a rare and unique species within the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other members of the genus. The plant produces small, violet-like flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
