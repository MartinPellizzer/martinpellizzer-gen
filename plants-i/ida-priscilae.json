    "intro": "Ida priscilae, commonly known as the ancient beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Ida priscilae is known for its slow growth and long blooming period, which can last several months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
