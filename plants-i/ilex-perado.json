    "intro": "Ilex perado, commonly known as the Japanese holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Ilex perado is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
