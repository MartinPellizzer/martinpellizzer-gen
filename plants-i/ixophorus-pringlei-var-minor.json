    "intro": "Ixophorus pringlei var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion grass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features tufts of dense, spiky, green to bluish-green foliage that resembles small pincushions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale blue flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
