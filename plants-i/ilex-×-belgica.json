    "intro": "Ilex \u00d7 belgica, commonly known as the Belgian holly, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree resulting from the cross between Ilex aquifolium (European holly) and Ilex crenata (Japanese holly). It is characterized by its dense, spiny leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hybrid nature, Ilex \u00d7 belgica exhibits a range of variability in leaf shape and size."
