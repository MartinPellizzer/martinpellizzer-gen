    "intro": "Ipomoea erythraea, commonly known as the red-veined morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with prominent red veins. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant blooms and rapid growth habit. The seeds are encased in a fibrous, fleshy capsule that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the ground."
