    "intro": "Iris pumila subsp. sintenisiiformis, commonly known as the Sintenisiiformis dwarf iris, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, lavender-blue flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches, making it a compact and ornamental choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, and is known for its hardiness in cooler climates. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in the study of iris evolution and taxonomy."
