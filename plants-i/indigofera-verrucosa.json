It is characterized by its erect or sprawling growth habit and compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in elongated, twisted pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
