    "intro": "Isochilus major var. amparoanus, commonly known as the Amparo orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of clustered, showy blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
