It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is also known for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions due to its specialized adaptations. Ipomoea welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back millions of years."
