    "intro": "Inula arenaria, commonly known as sand inula, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its flowering heads are composed of many small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Inula arenaria is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
