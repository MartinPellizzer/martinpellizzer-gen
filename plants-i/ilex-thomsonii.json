    "intro": "Ilex thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex thomsonii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky habitats, making it a hardy and adaptable species. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
