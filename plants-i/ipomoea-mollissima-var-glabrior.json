It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often opening in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can become invasive if not managed. The species is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
