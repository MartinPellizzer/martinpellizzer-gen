    "intro": "Iris unguicularis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-green in color. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It blooms in early summer, often in moist meadows and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in water-saturated environments, making it an important indicator species for wetland health."
