It typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are typically blue or violet, with five petals and prominent yellow stamens. It blooms from late spring to early summer, contributing to the floral diversity of its wetland habitats."
