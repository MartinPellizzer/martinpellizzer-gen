It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots contain compounds that have been traditionally used in dyeing textiles, similar to other members of the Fabaceae family. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens due to its attractive foliage and vibrant floral display."
