    "intro": "Ipomopsis congesta subsp. congesta, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is perennial, growing from a woody base and producing a dense cluster of flowers at the top of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky habitats and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
