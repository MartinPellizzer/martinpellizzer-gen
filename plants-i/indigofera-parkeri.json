    "intro": "Indigofera parkeri, commonly known as the African indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and makes it a valuable component of agroforestry systems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and environmental conservation."
