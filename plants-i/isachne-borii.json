    "intro": "Isachne borii, commonly known as the alpine isachne, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Isachne borii is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems."
