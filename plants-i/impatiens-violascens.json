    "intro": "Impatiens violascens, commonly known as the violet impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Impatiens violascens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
