    "intro": "Inga santanderensis, commonly known as the Santander velvet tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. The leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets, and the plant has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
