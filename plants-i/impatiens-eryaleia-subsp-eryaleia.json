    "intro": "Impatiens eryaleia subsp. eryaleia, commonly known as the water impatiens, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of showy, pink or red flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its stems are semi-woody and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily in wet habitats. The flowers are typically borne on long, slender pedicels, adding to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
