It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets during the spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and freshwater habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
