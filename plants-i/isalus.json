    "intro": "Isalus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices where it can access limited nutrients. Its unique morphology includes a short stem and small, inconspicuous leaves that help it conserve water. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Isalus is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
