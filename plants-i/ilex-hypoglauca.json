    "intro": "Ilex hypoglauca, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking silver-gray in the autumn. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Ilex hypoglauca is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban environments."
