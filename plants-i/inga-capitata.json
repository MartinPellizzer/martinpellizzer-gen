    "intro": "Inga capitata, commonly known as the \"capitata\" or \"sugar apple\" tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible fruits that are often referred to as \"sugar apples\" due to their sweet, honey-like flavor. Inga capitata is also valued for its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it useful in agroforestry systems. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
