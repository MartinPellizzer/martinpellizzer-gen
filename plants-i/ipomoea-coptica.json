    "intro": "Ipomoea coptica, commonly known as the Egyptian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is a climbing vine that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist, sunny habitats. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea coptica is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
