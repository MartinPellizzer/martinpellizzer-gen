    "intro": "Intsia rhombodea, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
