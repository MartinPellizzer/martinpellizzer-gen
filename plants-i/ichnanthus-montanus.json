    "intro": "Ichnanthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a valuable ornamental and ecological plant. Ichnanthus montanus is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
