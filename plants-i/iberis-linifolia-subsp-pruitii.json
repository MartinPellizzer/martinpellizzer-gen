    "intro": "Iberis linifolia subsp. pruitii, commonly known as coastal candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds."
