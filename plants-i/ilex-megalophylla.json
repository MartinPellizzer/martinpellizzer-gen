    "intro": "Ilex megalophylla, commonly known as the giant holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that can grow up to 10 inches in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex megalophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its dense foliage makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation."
