    "intro": "Indotristicha tirunelveliana, commonly known as the Tamil Nadu tristicha, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern regions of India. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
