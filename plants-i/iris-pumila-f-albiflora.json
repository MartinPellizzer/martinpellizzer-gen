    "intro": "Iris pumila f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered dwarf iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy white flowers with a distinctive blue-violet stripe on the inner petals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for wetland gardens or bog environments. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant for water gardens and naturalized landscapes. The white flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle elegance to the early season flora."
