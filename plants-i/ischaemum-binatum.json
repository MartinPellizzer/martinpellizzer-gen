    "intro": "Ischaemum binatum, commonly known as two-flowered goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two flowers per spikelet. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Ischaemum binatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
