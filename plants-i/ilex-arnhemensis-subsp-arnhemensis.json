    "intro": "Ilex arnhemensis subsp. arnhemensis, commonly known as the Arnhem ironwood, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
