    "intro": "Ilex mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Ilex mollis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping."
