    "intro": "Ilex malaccensis var. stenura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Ilex malaccensis. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
