    "intro": "Iris pumila subsp. tristis, commonly known as the slender iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact size and early blooming period make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller stature and more delicate floral structure compared to other iris species."
