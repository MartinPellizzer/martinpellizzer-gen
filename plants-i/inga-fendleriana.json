    "intro": "Inga fendleriana, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Inga fendleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
