    "intro": "Isolepis miliacea, commonly known as the millet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Isolepis miliacea is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
