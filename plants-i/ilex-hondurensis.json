    "intro": "Ilex hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex hondurensis thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warmer regions."
