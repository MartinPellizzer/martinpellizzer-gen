    "intro": "Ipomoea \u00d7 blancoi, commonly known as the hybrid sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) and Ipomoea triloba (common morning glory). The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its rapid growth and ability to trail or climb. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
