    "intro": "Isopyrum trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy whip-poor-will, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive hairy texture, contributing to its common name.
