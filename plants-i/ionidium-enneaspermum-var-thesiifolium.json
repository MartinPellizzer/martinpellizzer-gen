    "intro": "Ionidium enneaspermum var. thesiifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ionidium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with five petals, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
