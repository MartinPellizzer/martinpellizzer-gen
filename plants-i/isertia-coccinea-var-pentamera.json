    "intro": "Isertia coccinea var. pentamera, commonly known as the red coral tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant features a woody stem with a distinctive coral-like appearance, giving it its common name. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly glossy texture. While it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value, it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
