    "intro": "Ichnanthus calvescens, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, and its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The flowers are typically borne in clusters at the base of the plant, with three petals and three sepals that are often reflexed backward. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
