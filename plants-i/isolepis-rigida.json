    "intro": "Isolepis rigida, commonly known as rigid spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of stiff, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often hidden within the leafy sheaths. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Isolepis rigida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
