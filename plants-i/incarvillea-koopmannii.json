    "intro": "Incarvillea koopmannii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. Incarvillea koopmannii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
