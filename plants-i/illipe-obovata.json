    "intro": "Illipe obovata, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree's fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds surrounded by a rich, buttery pulp. The seeds are widely used to produce shea butter, a valuable natural product in cosmetics and food industries. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
