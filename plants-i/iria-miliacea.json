    "intro": "Iria miliacea, commonly known as the millet grass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Iria miliacea is sometimes considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
