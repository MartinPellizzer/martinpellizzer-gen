    "intro": "Inga umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella inga, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Inga umbellifera is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
