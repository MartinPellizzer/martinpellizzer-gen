    "intro": "Iris oxypetala, commonly known as the Sierra iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems that bear showy blue to violet flowers with a distinctive white or pale yellow center. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. Iris oxypetala thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
