    "intro": "Ilex engleriana, commonly known as Engler's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andes in South America. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Ilex engleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
