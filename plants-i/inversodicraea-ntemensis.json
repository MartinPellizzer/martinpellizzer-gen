    "intro": "Inversodicraea ntemensis, commonly known as the Cameroon orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its intricate, showy floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with purple markings, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, Inversodicraea ntemensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
