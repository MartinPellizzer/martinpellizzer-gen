    "intro": "Ipomoea arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnott's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, with heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that help it climb. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, hence its common name. Ipomoea arnottiana is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streams and in woodlands."
