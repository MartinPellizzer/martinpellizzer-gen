    "intro": "Iris aegyptia, commonly known as the Egyptian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Nile Valley and surrounding regions of Egypt. It features sword-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies. It is characterized by its rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread vegetatively. Iris aegyptia is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
