    "intro": "Isoptera lissophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight. Isoptera lissophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
