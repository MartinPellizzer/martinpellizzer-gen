The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ipomoea prostrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can spread rapidly, making it both a garden favorite and a potential weed."
