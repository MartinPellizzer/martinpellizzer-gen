    "intro": "Ichnanthus umbraphilus, commonly known as the shadowy bellflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, shaded understories of temperate forests. It thrives in low-light conditions, typically found growing along the forest floor where sunlight is filtered through a thick canopy. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are often pale green or white, adapted to attract specific pollinators in its dim environment. Its leaves are broad and waxy, helping to retain moisture in the moist, cool conditions of its habitat. Due to its specialized requirements, Ichnanthus umbraphilus is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
