    "intro": "Inula salicina subsp. semiamplexicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and basal leaves that are semi-amplexicaul, meaning they partially clasping the stem. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitats."
