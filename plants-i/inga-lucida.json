    "intro": "Inga lucida, commonly known as the coffee tree or wild coffee, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, which are used in the production of coffee. Inga lucida also plays an important ecological role in tropical forests by providing habitat and food for various animals."
