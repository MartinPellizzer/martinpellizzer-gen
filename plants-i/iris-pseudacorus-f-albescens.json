    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus f. albescens, commonly known as the white flag iris, is a striking variant of the yellow flag iris. This plant is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast sharply with its narrow, grass-like leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing showy, three-petaled structures that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water garden landscapes."
