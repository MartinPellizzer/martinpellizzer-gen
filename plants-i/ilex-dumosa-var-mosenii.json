    "intro": "Ilex dumosa var. mosenii, commonly known as the Mosenii holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedging plant. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
