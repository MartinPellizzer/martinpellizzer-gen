    "intro": "Ipomoea orizabensis subsp. austromexicana, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is often found growing in open areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
