    "intro": "Indigofera supralevis, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking clusters of yellow flowers that resemble showers of light. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
