    "intro": "Ipomoea riparum, commonly known as the water morning glory, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows along the edges of streams, ponds, and other water bodies. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its vines can climb or trail along the ground. Ipomoea riparum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
