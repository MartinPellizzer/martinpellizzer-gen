    "intro": "Idria columnaria, commonly known as the columnar cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the tips of the stems during the warmer months. Idria columnaria is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
