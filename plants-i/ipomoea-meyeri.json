    "intro": "Ipomoea meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from purple to blue, often with a white or yellow throat. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, spiral-shaped seed pods that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
