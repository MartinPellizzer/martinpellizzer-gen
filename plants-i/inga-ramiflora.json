    "intro": "Inga ramiflora, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, and the tree is often found in moist, shaded habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions make it ecologically significant in tropical ecosystems."
