It is characterized by its evergreen, spiny leaves that are typically glossy and dark green with white or yellow midribs. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex vulgaris thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
