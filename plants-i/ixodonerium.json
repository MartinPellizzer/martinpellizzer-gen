    "intro": "Ixodonerium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and striking, often purple or red, floral bracts. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are often found in high-altitude grasslands. Ixodonerium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
