    "intro": "Isolepis hemisphaerica, commonly known as the spherical spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It forms dense, compact clumps with cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis hemisphaerica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
