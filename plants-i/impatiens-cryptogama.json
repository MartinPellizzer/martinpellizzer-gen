    "intro": "Impatiens cryptogama, commonly known as the ghost impatiens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has a sprawling or trailing growth habit. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
