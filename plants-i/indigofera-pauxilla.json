It is native to South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. It produces small, hard pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Indigofera pauxilla is also valued for its historical use in dyeing textiles with a deep blue pigment."
