    "intro": "Incarvillea compacta var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf iron plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces striking blue-violet flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
