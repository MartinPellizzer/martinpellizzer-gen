    "intro": "Inversodicraea keayi, commonly known as the Keay's hakea, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and spiny stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Inversodicraea keayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to thrive."
