It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive white throat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure."
