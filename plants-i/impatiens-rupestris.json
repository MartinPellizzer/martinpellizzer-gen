    "intro": "Impatiens rupestris, commonly known as the rock impatiens, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its fleshy, succulent-like leaves help it store water, adapting it to its dry environment. Impatiens rupestris is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
