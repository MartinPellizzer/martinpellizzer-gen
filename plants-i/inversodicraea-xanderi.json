    "intro": "Inversodicraea xanderi, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. It has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often sprawling or ascending. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
