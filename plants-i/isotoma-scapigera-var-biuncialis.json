    "intro": "Isotoma scapigera var. biuncialis, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often rise from a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are characterized by their elongated, tubular shape and are often clustered in small groups at the ends of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Isotoma scapigera."
