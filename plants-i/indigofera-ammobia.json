    "intro": "Indigofera ammobia, commonly known as the coastal indigo or sandplain indigo, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its seeds are encased in hard, pod-like fruits that can remain viable in the soil for several years. Indigofera ammobia is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments."
