    "intro": "Iris napocae var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety is notable for its larger, more robust seed pods compared to other iris species."
