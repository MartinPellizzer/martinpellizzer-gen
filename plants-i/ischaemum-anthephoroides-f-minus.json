It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet bearing two to three small, two-lobed florets. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other similar grasses by its reduced floral structure and compact growth form."
