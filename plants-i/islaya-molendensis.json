    "intro": "Islaya molendensis, commonly known as the Molendens Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Molendens in the southern Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or marshy habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and typically have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Islaya molendensis is considered a vulnerable species."
