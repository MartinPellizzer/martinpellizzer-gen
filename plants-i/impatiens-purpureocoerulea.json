    "intro": "Impatiens purpureocoerulea, commonly known as the purple-blue impatiens, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored flowers that range from deep purple to bright blue, making it a visually appealing ornamental species. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. The flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures, facilitating self-pollination in the absence of pollinators."
