    "intro": "Ixia reclinata, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red stripe. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Ixia reclinata is known for its short blooming period, typically in late summer to early autumn."
