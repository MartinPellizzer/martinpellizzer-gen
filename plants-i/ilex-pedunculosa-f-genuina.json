    "intro": "Ilex pedunculosa f. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Mexico. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a hedge or specimen plant."
