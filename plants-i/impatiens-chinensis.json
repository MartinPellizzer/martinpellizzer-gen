    "intro": "Impatiens chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese impatiens, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden use. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
