    "intro": "Ilex graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are usually leathery in texture. The plant produces tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex graciliflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a humid climate."
