    "intro": "Ilex cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex cochinchinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for a variety of garden environments."
