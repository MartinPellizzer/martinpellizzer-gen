    "intro": "Ischaemum indicum var. villosum, commonly known as hairy goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are covered in short, bristly hairs. This species is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
