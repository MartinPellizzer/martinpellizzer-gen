    "intro": "Isachne bomoensis, commonly known as the Bomo grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it forms dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a compact panicle. Isachne bomoensis is characterized by its small, wind-pollinated flowers and produces small, dry seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
