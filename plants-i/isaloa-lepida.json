    "intro": "Isaloa lepida, commonly known as the Hawaiian starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often found in dry, sandy soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Isaloa lepida is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
