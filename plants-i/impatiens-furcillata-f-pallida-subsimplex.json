    "intro": "Impatiens furcillata f. pallida-subsimplex, commonly known as the pale subsimple leaf impatiens, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant tends to grow in moist, shaded environments. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf complexity compared to the typical form, giving it a more compact appearance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
