    "intro": "Ipomoea pterygocaulos, commonly known as the winged morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces distinctive, winged seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive if not managed properly."
