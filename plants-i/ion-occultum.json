    "intro": "Ion occultum, commonly known as the hidden ion plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the dense, mist-covered forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with an iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale-blue flowers that emit a faint, electric-like glow at night. Its roots are said to absorb trace minerals from the soil, contributing to its unique bioelectrical properties. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Ion occultum remains a subject of scientific curiosity and botanical study."
