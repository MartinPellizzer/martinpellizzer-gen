    "intro": "Ionidium buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf ionidium, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, rounded leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant. Due to its compact growth habit, it is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
