    "intro": "Impatiens bakthangensis, commonly known as the Bhutan impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the Eastern Himalayas, primarily found in Bhutan and parts of India. It is a member of the Balsaminaceae family, characterized by its showy, brightly colored flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
