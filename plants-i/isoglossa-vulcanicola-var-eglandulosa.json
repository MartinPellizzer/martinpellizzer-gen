    "intro": "Isoglossa vulcanicola var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the volcanic glandular isoglossa, is a unique plant species characterized by its glandular structures on its leaves and stems. It thrives in nutrient-rich volcanic soils, often found in areas with high mineral content and moderate humidity. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with short, thick stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in tiny, secreting glands. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically producing a distinctive yellowish or greenish hue. This variant is particularly adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of volcanic environments, making it a rare and specialized flora."
