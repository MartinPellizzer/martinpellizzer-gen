It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, three-petaled flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, often with a distinctive yellow or brown marking at the base of the petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Iris vicaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
