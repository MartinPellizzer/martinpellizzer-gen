    "intro": "Iris pallida, commonly known as the pale iris, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a silvery-blue hue, adding to its ornamental appeal."
