    "intro": "Ilex amelanchier, commonly known as the common holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and has a dense, compact form. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a leathery texture, and it flowers in late spring with inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The berries mature in late summer and are often used in traditional herbal medicine."
