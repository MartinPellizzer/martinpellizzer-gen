    "intro": "Ilex retusa f. major, commonly known as the large-leaved holly, is a shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical Ilex retusa. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its evergreen nature provides year-round visual interest in gardens."
