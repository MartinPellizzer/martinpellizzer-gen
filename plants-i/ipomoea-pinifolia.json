    "intro": "Ipomoea pinifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is a climbing vine with a vigorous growth habit, often seen twining around supports in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening in the evening and closing by dawn, a trait that contributes to its pollination by night-active insects. Ipomoea pinifolia is also known for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
