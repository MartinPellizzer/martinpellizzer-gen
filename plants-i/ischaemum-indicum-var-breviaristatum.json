    "intro": "Ischaemum indicum var. breviaristatum, commonly known as the narrow-awned barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers. Its seeds are typically small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural settings. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in cultivated fields."
