    "intro": "Ilex buxifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico. The plant is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex buxifolia is often used in landscaping for its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
