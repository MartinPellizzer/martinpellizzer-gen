It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and dark green, glossy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
