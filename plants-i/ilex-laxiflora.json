    "intro": "Ilex laxiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow, leathery leaves that are often glossy and have a distinct serrated edge. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex laxiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
