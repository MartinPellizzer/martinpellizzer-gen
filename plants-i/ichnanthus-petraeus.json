    "intro": "Ichnanthus petraeus, commonly known as the rock iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in crevices, making it well adapted to its alpine habitat. Ichnanthus petraeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
