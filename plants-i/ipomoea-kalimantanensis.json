    "intro": "Ipomoea kalimantanensis, commonly known as the Bornean morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in vibrant shades of purple or blue. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces edible tuberous roots, which are sometimes used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing along forest edges or in swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
