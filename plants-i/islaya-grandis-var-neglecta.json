    "intro": "Islaya grandis var. neglecta, commonly known as the slender Islaya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pale yellow or white. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
