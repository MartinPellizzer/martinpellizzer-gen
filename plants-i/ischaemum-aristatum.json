    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum, commonly known as the tall oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, bearing small, two-lobed florets. Ischaemum aristatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
