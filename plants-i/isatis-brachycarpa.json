    "intro": "Isatis brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited woad, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its blue to violet flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as meadows and riverbanks. Its small, spherical fruits are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among the genus Isatis. It has been historically used for dye production, similar to its more well-known relative, Isatis tinctoria."
