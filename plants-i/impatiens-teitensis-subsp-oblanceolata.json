    "intro": "Impatiens teitensis subsp. oblanceolata, commonly known as the Taiti impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the island of Taiti in the French Southern and Antarctic Territories. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate to oblanceolate leaves. The flowers are typically showy, with five petals and a distinctive spurred structure, often in shades of pink or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid subtropical climate of its native habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
