    "intro": "Ipomoea cissoides f. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory family characterized by its distinctive, velvety, sticky hairs covering its stems and leaves. This plant is native to the southern United States and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically displaying shades of purple or blue. The sticky hairs, known as trichomes, serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and may also aid in water retention. It is often found growing in disturbed soils along roadsides or in open woodlands."
