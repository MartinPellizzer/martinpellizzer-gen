    "intro": "Ipomoea halophila, commonly known as saltbush or sea hibiscus, is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments. It is native to coastal regions of the Americas and is adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations in its soil and foliage. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water, and its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ipomoea halophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
