It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plants typically grow in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or saline soils. Iodanthus species are often found in Mediterranean and coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
