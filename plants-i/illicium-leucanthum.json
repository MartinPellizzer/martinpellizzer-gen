    "intro": "Illicium leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered star anise, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Schisandraceae and is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, dark brown fruits that are similar in appearance to star anise but are not used for culinary purposes. Illicium leucanthum is often grown for its ornamental value due to its striking white blooms. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments."
