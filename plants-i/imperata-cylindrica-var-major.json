    "intro": "Imperata cylindrica var. major, commonly known as purple mat grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features stiff, cylindrical leaves that are typically purple or pink in color, which distinguish it from other varieties of Imperata. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like structure that produces small, spiky flowers, contributing to its ornamental value in some landscapes."
