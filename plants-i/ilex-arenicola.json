    "intro": "Ilex arenicola, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along the edges of coastal scrub habitats. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a glossy appearance. Its small white flowers appear in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for local wildlife. Ilex arenicola is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
