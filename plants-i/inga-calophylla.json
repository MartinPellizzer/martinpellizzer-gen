It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, clustered white flowers. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The tree is valued for its fast growth and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its ecological benefits."
