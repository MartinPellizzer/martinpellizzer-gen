    "intro": "Ichthyothere peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of the Andes. It possesses broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with showy petals that attract pollinators such as beetles and flies. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread through underground stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
