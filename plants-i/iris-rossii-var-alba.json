    "intro": "Iris rossii var. alba, commonly known as the White Ross Iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, showy white to pale blue flowers with a distinctive violet-blue throat. The plant produces sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are dark green and densely arranged at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
