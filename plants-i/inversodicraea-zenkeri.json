    "intro": "Inversodicraea zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's evergreen, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
