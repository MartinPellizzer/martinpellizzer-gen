    "intro": "Ipomoea signata, commonly known as the pink morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that open in the morning and close in the late afternoon. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Ipomoea signata is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of up to 10 feet, using tendrils to support itself. It blooms from late spring to early fall, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat."
