    "intro": "Indigofera goniodes, commonly known as the African indigo or blue bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
