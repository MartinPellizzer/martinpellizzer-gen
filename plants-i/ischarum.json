    "intro": "Ischarum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting to saline and well-drained environments. They are characterized by their spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads, giving them a distinctive appearance. The flowers are usually blue or purple and bloom in the summer months. Ischarum species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
