    "intro": "Ipomoea saltiana, commonly known as the saltbush morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically small, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help reduce water loss. Ipomoea saltiana is also notable for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, which is reflected in its common name."
