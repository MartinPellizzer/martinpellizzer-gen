    "intro": "Ipomoea polytricha, commonly known as the curly bindweed, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its stems are twining and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread over other vegetation. Ipomoea polytricha is known for its rapid growth and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
