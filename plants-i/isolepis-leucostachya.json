    "intro": "Isolepis leucostachya, commonly known as silver-stem sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or pale coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Isolepis leucostachya plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
