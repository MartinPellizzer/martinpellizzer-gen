    "intro": "Ipomoea buchneri var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, often reaching heights of several meters. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal but can be invasive in certain environments."
