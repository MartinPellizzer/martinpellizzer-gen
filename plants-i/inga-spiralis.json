    "intro": "Inga spiralis, commonly known as the spiral inga, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Inga spiralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral displays. It also plays a role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
