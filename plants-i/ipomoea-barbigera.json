    "intro": "Ipomoea barbigera, commonly known as the silky morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, and its vines can grow quite long, often climbing supports or other vegetation. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers typically open in the morning and close by late afternoon, giving it its common name."
