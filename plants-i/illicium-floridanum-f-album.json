    "intro": "Illicium floridanum f. album, commonly known as the white anise tree, is a rare and striking plant native to Florida. It belongs to the family Schisandraceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain aromatic seeds. Its ornamental value is notable, though it is quite uncommon in cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
