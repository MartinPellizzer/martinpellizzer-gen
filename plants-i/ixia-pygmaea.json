    "intro": "Ixia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf fire lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to South Africa. It produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of only 10-20 cm, making it a compact and ornamental choice for gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. Ixia pygmaea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
