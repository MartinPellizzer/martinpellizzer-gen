    "intro": "Ipomoea albidiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing supports or other vegetation. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Ipomoea albidiflora is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many other species of morning glories."
