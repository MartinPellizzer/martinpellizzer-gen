    "intro": "Ilex tenuifolia, commonly known as the Japanese holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex tenuifolia thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense foliage and year-round appearance make it a valuable plant in both garden and natural settings."
