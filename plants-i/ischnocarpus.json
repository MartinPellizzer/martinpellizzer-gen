    "intro": "Ischnocarpus, commonly known as the \"spear-fruit\" or \"spearwood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, spiky fruits that resemble spears, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Ischnocarpus species are native to various regions of Australia and are often found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their distinctive appearance."
