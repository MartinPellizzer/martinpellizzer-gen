    "intro": "Iris nertchinskia var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered Siberian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, lavender-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, blooming in early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
