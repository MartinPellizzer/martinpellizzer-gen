It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Isolepis pottsii typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, playing a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
