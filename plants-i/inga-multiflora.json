    "intro": "Inga multiflora, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its root system is fibrous and can help stabilize soil, making it useful in reforestation efforts. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
