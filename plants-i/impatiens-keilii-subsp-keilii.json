    "intro": "Impatiens keilii subsp. keilii, commonly known as the Keil's impatiens, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers. The flowers typically range in color from white to pink and are borne on pedicels that are often shorter than the petals. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
