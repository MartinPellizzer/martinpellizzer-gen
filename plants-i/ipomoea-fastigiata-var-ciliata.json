    "intro": "Ipomoea fastigiata var. ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types make it both a horticultural curiosity and a potential weed. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
