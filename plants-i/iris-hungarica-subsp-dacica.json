    "intro": "Iris hungarica subsp. dacica, commonly known as the Hungarian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along riverbanks. It blooms in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of its native range."
