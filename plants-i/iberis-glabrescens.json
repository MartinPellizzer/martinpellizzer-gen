    "intro": "Iberis glabrescens, commonly known as the white candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with greyish-green, hairy leaves that become smoother as the plant matures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
