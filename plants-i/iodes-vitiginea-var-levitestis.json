    "intro": "Iodes vitiginea var. levitestis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
