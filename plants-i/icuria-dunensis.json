    "intro": "Icuria dunensis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Icuria dunensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
