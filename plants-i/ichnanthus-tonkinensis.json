    "intro": "Ichnanthus tonkinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
