It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces long, winding vines that can climb or trail along the ground. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for its beauty and ecological benefits."
