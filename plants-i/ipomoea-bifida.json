    "intro": "Ipomoea bifida, commonly known as the split-flower morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, split petals that give it its scientific name, and it produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is a perennial vine that can grow up to several meters in length, climbing or trailing along surfaces. Ipomoea bifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
