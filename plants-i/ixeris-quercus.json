    "intro": "Ixeris quercus, commonly known as the oakleaf ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of broad, oak-like leaves. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellow to orange-red composite flowers. These flowers are composed of numerous tiny florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Ixeris quercus thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats."
