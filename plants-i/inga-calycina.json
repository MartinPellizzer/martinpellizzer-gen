    "intro": "Inga calycina, commonly known as the \"sweet shower tree,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for soil enrichment and reforestation efforts. Inga calycina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests."
