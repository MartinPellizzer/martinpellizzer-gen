    "intro": "Inula armena, commonly known as Armenian Inula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. Its yellow flower heads consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Inula armena is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
