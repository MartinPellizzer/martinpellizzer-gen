    "intro": "Ipomoea sarmentacea, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a perennial vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
