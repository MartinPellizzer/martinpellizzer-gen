It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
