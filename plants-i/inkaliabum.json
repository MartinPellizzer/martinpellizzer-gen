    "intro": "Inkaliabum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas or salt-affected landscapes. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters. Inkaliabum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
