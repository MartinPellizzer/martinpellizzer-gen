    "intro": "Isotrema involutum, commonly known as the curled leaf fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often curl inward, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its foliage. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
