    "intro": "Inocarpus, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its unique, swollen stems that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Inocarpus species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale in color. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
