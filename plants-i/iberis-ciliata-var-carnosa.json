It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
