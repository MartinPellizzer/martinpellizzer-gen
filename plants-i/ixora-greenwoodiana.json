    "intro": "Ixora greenwoodiana, commonly known as the greenwood ixora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bright orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens. Ixora greenwoodiana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
