It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are alternate, finely divided, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Illecebrum sibiricum is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
