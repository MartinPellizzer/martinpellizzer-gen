    "intro": "Impatiens scitula, commonly known as the rock impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of only a few inches, and features velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Impatiens scitula is also known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
