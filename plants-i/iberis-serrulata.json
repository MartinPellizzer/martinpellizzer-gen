The plant features pinnately compound leaves with finely serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Iberis serrulata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
