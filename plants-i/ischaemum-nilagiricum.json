    "intro": "Ischaemum nilagiricum, commonly known as the Nilagiri grass, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed florets, typical of many grass species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
