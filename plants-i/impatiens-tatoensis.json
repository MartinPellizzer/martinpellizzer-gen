    "intro": "Impatiens tatoensis, commonly known as the Tato Mountains impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tato Mountains in Ecuador. It is a member of the Balsaminaceae family, characterized by its delicate, showy flowers and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Impatiens tatoensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
