It is characterized by its coarse, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Ischaemum imberbe is valued for its resilience and is often used in erosion control and pasture management."
