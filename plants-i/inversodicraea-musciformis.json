    "intro": "Inversodicraea musciformis, commonly known as the mossy broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies."
