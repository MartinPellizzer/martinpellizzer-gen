It features a robust, branched root system that is dark red in color, which gives the plant its common name. The plant has upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Imperatoria major is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
