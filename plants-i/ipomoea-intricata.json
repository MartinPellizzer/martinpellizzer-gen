It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed carefully."
