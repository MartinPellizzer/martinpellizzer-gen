    "intro": "Imbralyx niveus, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, silvery-white undersides on its lance-shaped leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are compound, with multiple pinnae that create a feathery texture. Imbralyx niveus reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves."
