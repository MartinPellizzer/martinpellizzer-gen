    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. pendula-aurea-marginata, commonly known as the golden margined weeping holly, is a hybrid holly plant characterized by its pendulous growth habit and striking foliage. Its leaves are typically golden-yellow with a distinctive red or orange margin, adding a vibrant visual appeal to gardens. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental shrub due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil types. While it retains the hardiness of the common holly, its varietal traits make it a sought-after addition to landscape design."
