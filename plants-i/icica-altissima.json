    "intro": "Icica altissima, commonly known as the tall icica, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its arid environment. Icica altissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
