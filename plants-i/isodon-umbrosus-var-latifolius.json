    "intro": "Isodon umbrosus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf isodon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically pubescent and have a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of blue to purple flowers, which bloom during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This variety is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
