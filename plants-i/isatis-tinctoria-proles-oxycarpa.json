    "intro": "Isatis tinctoria proles oxycarpa, commonly known as the woad plant, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most notable botanical feature is the production of a blue dye from its leaves, which historically played a significant role in textile industries. The proles oxycarpa variety is distinguished by its more acute, pointed leaves compared to the standard woad."
