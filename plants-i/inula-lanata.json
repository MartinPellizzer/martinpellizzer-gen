    "intro": "Inula lanata, commonly known as the hairy elecampane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a woolly texture. Inula lanata is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
