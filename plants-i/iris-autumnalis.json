    "intro": "Iris autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Iris autumnalis is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
