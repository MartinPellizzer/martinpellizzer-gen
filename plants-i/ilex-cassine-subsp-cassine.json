    "intro": "Ilex cassine subsp. cassine, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
