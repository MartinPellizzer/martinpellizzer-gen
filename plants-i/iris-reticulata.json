    "intro": "Iris reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated iris, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically in early spring. Its leaves are sword-shaped and grass-like, forming a dense rosette around the base. Iris reticulata is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
