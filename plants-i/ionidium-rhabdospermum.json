    "intro": "Ionidium rhabdospermum, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which appear in spring. Ionidium rhabdospermum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
