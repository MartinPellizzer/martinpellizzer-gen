    "intro": "Imperatoria palustris, commonly known as swamp sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across muddy or marshy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by tiny, triangular seed capsules. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Imperatoria palustris is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
