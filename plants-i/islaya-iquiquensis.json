It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Islaya iquiquensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
