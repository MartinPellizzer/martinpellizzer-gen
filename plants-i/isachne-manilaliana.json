    "intro": "Isachne manilaliana, commonly known as the Manila grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each flowering stem. Isachne manilaliana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
