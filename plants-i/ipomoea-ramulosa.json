    "intro": "Ipomoea ramulosa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in gardens. Ipomoea ramulosa is also known for its ability to climb or trail, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets."
