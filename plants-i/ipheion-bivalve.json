    "intro": "Ipheion bivalve, commonly known as the silverleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a silvery or grayish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal water requirements."
