    "intro": "Ischaleon, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the thin, cold air. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Ischaleon is considered a conservation concern."
