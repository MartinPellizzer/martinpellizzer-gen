    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow flag, is a variant of the yellow flag iris native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
