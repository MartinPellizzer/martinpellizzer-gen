It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Iris triflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
