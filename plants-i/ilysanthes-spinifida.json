    "intro": "Ilysanthes spinifida, commonly known as the spiny broom, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ilysanthes spinifida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
