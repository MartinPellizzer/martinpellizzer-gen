    "intro": "Ilysanthes geniculata, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Ilysanthes geniculata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
