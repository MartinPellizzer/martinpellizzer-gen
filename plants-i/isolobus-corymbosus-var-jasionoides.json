    "intro": "Isolobus corymbosus var. jasionoides, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features tall, slender stems that bear numerous narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, branched clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily in moist soils. It is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
