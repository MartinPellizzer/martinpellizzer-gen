    "intro": "Iris pseudocyperus, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Africa and the Middle East. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic environment. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in marshy areas. The flowers are typically arranged in a spike, with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, characteristic of the iris family."
