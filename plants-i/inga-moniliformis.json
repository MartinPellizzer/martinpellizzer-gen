It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important component of forest ecosystems and useful for reforestation efforts."
