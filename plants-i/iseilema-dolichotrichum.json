    "intro": "Iseilema dolichotrichum, commonly known as the long-hair grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, thread-like leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typical of many grasses. Iseilema dolichotrichum is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
