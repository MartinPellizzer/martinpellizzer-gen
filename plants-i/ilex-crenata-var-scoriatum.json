    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. scoriatum, commonly known as Japanese Holly or Japanese Boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to tolerate pruning. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for formal garden designs and topiary."
