It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its fruits are berries that contain several seeds. Iochroma horridum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
