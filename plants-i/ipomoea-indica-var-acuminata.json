    "intro": "Ipomoea indica var. acuminata, commonly known as the Indian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in gardens and along roadsides. Its rapid growth habit makes it both ornamental and invasive in some areas. The flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, adding to its distinctive botanical appeal."
