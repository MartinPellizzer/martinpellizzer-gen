    "intro": "Iris vernalis, commonly known as the spring iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three smaller, spurred sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, making it an early indicator of seasonal change. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
