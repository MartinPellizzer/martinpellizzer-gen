    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium f. frivaldskyana, commonly known as the Frivaldsky's holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with serrated margins. The leaves are typically shorter and more rounded compared to the standard holly, giving it a distinct appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. This form is a natural variant of the common holly, Ilex aquifolium, and is adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use in woodland settings."
