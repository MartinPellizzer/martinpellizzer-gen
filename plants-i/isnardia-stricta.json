    "intro": "Isnardia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a woody stem with a somewhat prickly texture, and its leaves are often arranged in opposite pairs. Despite its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
