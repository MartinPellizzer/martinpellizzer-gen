    "intro": "Iliamna grandiflora, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in moist, rocky habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Iliamna grandiflora plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
