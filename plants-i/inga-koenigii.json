    "intro": "Inga koenigii, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. The plant has also been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
