    "intro": "Ischaemum ensiforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are typically green or brown in color. Ischaemum ensiforme is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
