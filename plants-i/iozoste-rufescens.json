    "intro": "Iozoste rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that turn reddish-brown with age, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark berries that are edible for some bird species. Iozoste rufescens is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial to full sun, making it a common sight in woodland edges and open areas."
