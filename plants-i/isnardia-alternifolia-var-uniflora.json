    "intro": "Isnardia alternifolia var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower alternateleaf plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate leaf arrangement and solitary, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The flowers, which are small and white, bloom in late spring and attract various pollinators."
