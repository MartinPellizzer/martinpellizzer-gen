    "intro": "Iresine polymorpha var. diffusa, commonly known as the red flame plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to tropical regions of South America. It features vibrant, bi-colored leaves with a deep red underside and a contrasting green or purple top surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its eye-catching foliage rather than its flowers."
