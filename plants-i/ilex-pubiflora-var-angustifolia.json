    "intro": "Ilex pubiflora var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
