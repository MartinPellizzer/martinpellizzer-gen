    "intro": "Isostigma simplicifolium var. simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaf isostigma, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous, and it prefers well-drained soil in a sunny to partially shaded environment. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
