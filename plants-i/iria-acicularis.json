It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and strikingly tall, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pale blue or violet in color. Iria acicularis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
