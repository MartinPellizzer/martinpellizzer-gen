    "intro": "Ischaemum stipitatum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in panicles, bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Ischaemum stipitatum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and forage for various insects and small animals."
