It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
