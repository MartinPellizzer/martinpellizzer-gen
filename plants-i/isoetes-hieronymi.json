    "intro": "Isoetes hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi watermace, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the order Sphenopsida. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a central axis known as the sporophyll. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it anchors itself to the substrate with its rhizomes. Its morphology includes a rosette-like arrangement of leaves that are often submerged or floating. The reproductive structures are specialized, with the sporangia producing spores that disperse through water, facilitating the plant's propagation."
