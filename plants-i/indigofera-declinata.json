    "intro": "Indigofera declinata, commonly known as the blue indigo bush, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, hard pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh climates. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
