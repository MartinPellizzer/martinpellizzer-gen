    "intro": "Ipomoea hypoxantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and attractive blooms make it both a desirable ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain regions."
