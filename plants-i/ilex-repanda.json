    "intro": "Ilex repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex repanda thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense growth habit also provides effective privacy screening in garden settings."
