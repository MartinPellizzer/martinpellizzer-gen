    "intro": "Ilex spathulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex spathulata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
