    "intro": "Iris pratensis, commonly known as the meadow iris, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces showy, blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Iris pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting biodiversity."
