It typically grows in moist, tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually pale green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
