    "intro": "Ixeris integra, commonly known as the Japanese mat grass or golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features a dense mat of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Ixeris integra thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to landscaping."
