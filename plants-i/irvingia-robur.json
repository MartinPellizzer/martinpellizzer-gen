    "intro": "Irvingia robur, commonly known as African shea tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing oily seeds. These seeds are the primary source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and food. Irvingia robur plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
