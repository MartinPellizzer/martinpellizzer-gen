It belongs to the Amaryllis family and is characterized by its striking, orange-red flowers that resemble torches. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that are often clustered in a raceme, adding a dramatic visual impact. Ixia elegans thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.
