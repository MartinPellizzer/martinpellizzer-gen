    "intro": "Isachne ligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf isachne, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Isachne ligulata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
