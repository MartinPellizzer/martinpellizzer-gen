    "intro": "Isnardia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-fruit or red globe tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its distinctive spherical fruits. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and can grow into a shrub or small tree. The fruit, which is round and fleshy, contains several seeds and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
