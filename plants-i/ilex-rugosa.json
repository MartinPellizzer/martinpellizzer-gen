    "intro": "Ilex rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex rugosa typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide winter interest."
