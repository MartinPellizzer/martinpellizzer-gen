    "intro": "Ipomoea pandurata var. candicans, commonly known as the showy morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the velvety calyx. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and has a rapid growth habit, making it suitable for trellises or support structures. Its flowering period typically occurs in the early morning, hence its common name, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
