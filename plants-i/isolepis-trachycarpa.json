    "intro": "Isolepis trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-fruited bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and ditches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its fruit is a dry, three-angled capsule, which is characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Isolepis trachycarpa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
