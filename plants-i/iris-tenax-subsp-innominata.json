    "intro": "Iris tenax subsp. innominata, commonly known as the slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of *I. tenax*."
