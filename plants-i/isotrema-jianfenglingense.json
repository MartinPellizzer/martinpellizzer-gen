    "intro": "Isotrema jianfenglingense, commonly known as the Jianfengling isotrema, is a rare plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, drupaceous fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
