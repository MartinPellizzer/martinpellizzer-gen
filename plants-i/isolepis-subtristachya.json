    "intro": "Isolepis subtristachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Isolepis subtristachya thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
