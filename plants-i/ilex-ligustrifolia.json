    "intro": "Ilex ligustrifolia, commonly known as the evergreen holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red berries that appear in the fall. Ilex ligustrifolia is evergreen, meaning it retains its foliage year-round, providing seasonal interest in landscapes. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens."
