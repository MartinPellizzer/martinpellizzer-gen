It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the summer months. Its roots are known to contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Indigofera peltata is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along riverbanks and in agricultural areas."
