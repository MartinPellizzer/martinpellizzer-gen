    "intro": "Ionidium glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a viscid, sticky substance on its surface, which helps in retaining moisture and protecting against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is the body of the lichen, and it lacks true roots, stems, or leaves."
