It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, blooming in the evening. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Ipomoea viscosa is often found growing in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain regions."
