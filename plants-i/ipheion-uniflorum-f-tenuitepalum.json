    "intro": "Ipheion uniflorum f. tenuitepalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, showy blue to purple flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture. The variety tenuitepalum is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Ipheion uniflorum."
