It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing in dunes or along rocky shores. Its unique morphology helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. The flowers attract a variety of pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
