    "intro": "Ischaemum rugosum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. Ischaemum rugosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
