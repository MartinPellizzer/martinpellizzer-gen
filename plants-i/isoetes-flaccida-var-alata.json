    "intro": "Isoetes flaccida var. alata, commonly known as the flaccid watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Sphenopsida. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbon-like leaves that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, where it can anchor itself to the substrate with its rhizomes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form, including its more elongated and flexible leaves."
