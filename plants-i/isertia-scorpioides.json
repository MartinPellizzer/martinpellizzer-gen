    "intro": "Isertia scorpioides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking blue to purple flowers that open in the early morning. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a day, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Isertia scorpioides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in dry, open habitats."
