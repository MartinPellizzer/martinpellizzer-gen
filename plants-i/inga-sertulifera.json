    "intro": "Inga sertulifera, commonly known as the \"butterfly tree,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences that resemble the wings of butterflies, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Inga sertulifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
