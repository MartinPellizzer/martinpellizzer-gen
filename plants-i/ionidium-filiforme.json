    "intro": "Ionidium filiforme, commonly known as the slender ionidium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features elongated, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth near rivers or streams. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Ionidium filiforme is considered an endangered species."
