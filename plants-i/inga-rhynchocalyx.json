    "intro": "Inga rhynchocalyx, commonly known as the red-veined inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive red venation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. It is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. The tree's rapid growth makes it an important species in reforestation efforts."
