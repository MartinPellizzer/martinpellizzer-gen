It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Iris \u00d7 violacea is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
