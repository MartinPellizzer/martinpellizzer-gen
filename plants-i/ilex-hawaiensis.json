    "intro": "Ilex hawaiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Ilex hawaiensis is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular plant in landscaping across the islands."
