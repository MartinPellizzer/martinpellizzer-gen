    "intro": "Indigofera rubroglandulosa, commonly known as the red-glandular indigo plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking red glandular structures on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Indigofera rubroglandulosa is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
