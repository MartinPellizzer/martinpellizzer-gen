    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with spiny margins that are less pronounced than in other holly varieties. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
