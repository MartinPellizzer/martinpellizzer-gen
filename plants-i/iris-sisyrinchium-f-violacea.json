    "intro": "Iris sisyrinchium f. violacea, commonly known as the violet iris, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both the iris and the sisyrinchium genera. It is distinguished by its striking violet-blue flower color, which is more intense than that of typical iris species. The plant typically features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This cultivar is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and unique coloration."
