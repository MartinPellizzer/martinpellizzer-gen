    "intro": "Impatiens tawetensis, commonly known as the Tawet impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the genus Impatiens, which is part of the family Balsaminaceae. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its seeds are dispersed by the explosive release of its capsule fruit, a unique adaptation that aids in its propagation."
