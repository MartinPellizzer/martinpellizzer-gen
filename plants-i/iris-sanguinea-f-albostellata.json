    "intro": "Iris sanguinea f. albostellata, commonly known as the white-streaked red iris, is a rare and striking variant of the red iris species. It is characterized by its pale purple to white petals with distinct white or pale yellow streaks, creating a striking contrast against the deep red of the standard form. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces showy, sword-shaped leaves. This cultivar is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique coloration."
