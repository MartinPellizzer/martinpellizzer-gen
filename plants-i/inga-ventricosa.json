    "intro": "Inga ventricosa, commonly known as the \"bottle tree\" or \"crown of thorns,\" is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk and compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary forests. Inga ventricosa is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
