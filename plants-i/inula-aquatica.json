    "intro": "Inula aquatica, commonly known as water lettuces, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
