    "intro": "Ionidium heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It has lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long and are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
