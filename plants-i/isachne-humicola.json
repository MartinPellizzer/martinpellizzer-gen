    "intro": "Isachne humicola, commonly known as the bog isachne, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Isachne humicola thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and other moist environments. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
