    "intro": "Isotrema yangii, commonly known as the Yang's isotrema, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Lauraceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. Isotrema yangii is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
