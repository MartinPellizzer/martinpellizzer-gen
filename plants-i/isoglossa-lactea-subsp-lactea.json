It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
