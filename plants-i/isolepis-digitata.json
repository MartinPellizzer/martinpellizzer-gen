    "intro": "Isolepis digitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tussock grass, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Isolepis digitata thrives in waterlogged soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of its habitat."
