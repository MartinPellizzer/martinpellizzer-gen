    "intro": "Intsia bakeri, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The tree produces hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Due to its economic importance and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
