    "intro": "Indigofera matudae, commonly known as Matudae's indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
