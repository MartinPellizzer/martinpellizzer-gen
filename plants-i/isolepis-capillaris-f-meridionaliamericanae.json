    "intro": "Isolepis capillaris f. meridionaliamericanae, commonly known as the southern marsh sedge, is a variant of the common sedge found in wetland environments across the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes and swampy areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This form is notable for its adaptability to warmer, southern climates compared to the typical distribution of the species."
