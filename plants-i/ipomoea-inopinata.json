    "intro": "Ipomoea inopinata, commonly known as the Florida morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, hence its common name. Ipomoea inopinata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
