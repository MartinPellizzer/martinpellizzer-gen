    "intro": "Ilex godajam, commonly known as the Himalayan holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Ilex godajam is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is commonly found in mountainous regions of India and Nepal."
