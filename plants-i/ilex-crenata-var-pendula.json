    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Japanese holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, cascading foliage. Its leaves are small, oval, and glossy, with a slightly wavy margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its elegant, drooping form."
