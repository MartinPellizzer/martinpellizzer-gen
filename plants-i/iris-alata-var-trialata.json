    "intro": "Iris alata var. trialata, commonly known as the silver stripe iris, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched stalks that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a white or pale blue stripe running down the center of each petal. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a short rhizome, typical of many iris species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant blooms."
