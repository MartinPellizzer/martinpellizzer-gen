Isodon species are typically found in temperate regions and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Many species have creeping or upright growth habits, and they often thrive in well-drained soils. The genus includes several species, such as Isodon rotundifolius and Isodon japonicus, which are valued for their ornamental and medicinal properties."
