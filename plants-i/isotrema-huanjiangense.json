    "intro": "Isotrema huanjiangense, commonly known as the Huanjiang isotrema, is a rare flowering plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
