    "intro": "Ipomoea dichotoma var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped, ranging in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that open in the morning and close by midday. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
