    "intro": "Iris humilis var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pale blue to lavender flowers with a distinctive, three-lobed petal structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
