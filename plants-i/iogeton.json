    "intro": "Iogeton, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and striking, often showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Iogeton species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
