    "intro": "Indigofera compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, pod-like fruits that split open when mature to release the seeds. Indigofera compressa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
