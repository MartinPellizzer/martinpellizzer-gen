    "intro": "Isoglossa bruceae, commonly known as the Bruce's isoglossa, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect flowering stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with prominent bracts. Isoglossa bruceae thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
