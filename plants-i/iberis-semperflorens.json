    "intro": "Iberis semperflorens, commonly known as winter flowering cyclamen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features a dense rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in colder climates, though it may require protection in extremely harsh winters."
