    "intro": "Icica palmeri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a hairy, low-growing structure to reduce water loss. Its leaves are usually basal, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Icica palmeri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
