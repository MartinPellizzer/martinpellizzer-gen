    "intro": "Inula discoidea, commonly known as the yellow disk flower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Inula discoidea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
