    "intro": "Ipomoea petrophila, commonly known as the cave morning glory, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the limestone caves of central Texas. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom at dawn, adapting to the low-light conditions of its subterranean habitat. The plant has tubular, hairy leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is protected by conservation efforts. Its unique ecological niche makes it an important subject for botanical research."
