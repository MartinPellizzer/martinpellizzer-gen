    "intro": "Ischaemum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and dense, tufted inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to temperate climates. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, spikelet-based flowers. Ischaemum latifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
