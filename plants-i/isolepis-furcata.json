It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown in color. Isolepis furcata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
