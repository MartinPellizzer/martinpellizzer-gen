    "intro": "Irenepharsus phasmatodes, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the intricate patterns of a ghostly silhouette. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
