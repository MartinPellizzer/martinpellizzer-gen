    "intro": "Iberis montana, commonly known as Alpine candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Iberis montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
