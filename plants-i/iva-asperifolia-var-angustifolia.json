    "intro": "Iva asperifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marshelder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture, and its stems are often hairy and slightly glandular. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
