    "intro": "Inga dubia, commonly known as the wild coffee tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Inga dubia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important component of agroforestry systems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful species for reforestation and soil restoration projects."
