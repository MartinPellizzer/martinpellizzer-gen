    "intro": "Ionidium glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its striking bluish-green foliage. The plant's leaves are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. Ionidium glaucum thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
