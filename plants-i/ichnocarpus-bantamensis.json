    "intro": "Ichnocarpus bantamensis, commonly known as the Bantam burr, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the flowers are small and usually pale in color. The seeds are enclosed in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing."
