It is characterized by its distinctive winged leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces edible pods that contain seeds and a starchy, protein-rich seed kernel. It is often cultivated for its nutritional value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it an important crop in sustainable agriculture."
