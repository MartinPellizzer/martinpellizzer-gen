    "intro": "Ipomoea triloba var. glaberrima, commonly known as the silky morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in gardens."
