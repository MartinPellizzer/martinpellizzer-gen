    "intro": "Ipomoea longiflora var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variegated morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves with combinations of green, white, and yellow, and its trumpet-shaped, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for climbing structures or as a ground cover. The flowers emit a mild fragrance and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
