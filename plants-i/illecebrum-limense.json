    "intro": "Illecebrum limense, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged conditions and is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is well-adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat."
