    "intro": "Ipomoea aquatica var. heterophylla, commonly known as water spinach or kangkong, is a fast-growing aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that vary in size depending on the growing conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often cultivated for its edible leaves. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native environments if not managed properly."
