    "intro": "Isolepis hirta, commonly known as hairy spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis hirta typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
