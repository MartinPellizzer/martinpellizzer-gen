It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its dense growth habit and year-round foliage make it an excellent candidate for hedges or foundation plantings."
