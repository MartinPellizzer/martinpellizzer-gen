    "intro": "Isolepis sulcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it forms dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly curved and have a distinctive ribbed or grooved surface. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Isolepis sulcata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
