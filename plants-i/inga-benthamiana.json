    "intro": "Inga benthamiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant is also used in research for its potential in phytoremediation and as a model organism in plant biology studies."
