    "intro": "Inga canaminensis, commonly known as the white inga, is a fast-growing tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers. The plant has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its fruits are edible and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals."
