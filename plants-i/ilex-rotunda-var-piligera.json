    "intro": "Ilex rotunda var. piligera, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to China. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its evergreen foliage and seasonal flowering. The species is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
