    "intro": "Ipomoea procumbens var. elliptica, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, elliptical leaves that are typically green with a smooth texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in the morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in cultivated areas."
