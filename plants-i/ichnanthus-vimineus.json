    "intro": "Ichnanthus vimineus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ichnanthus vimineus thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or naturalized areas."
