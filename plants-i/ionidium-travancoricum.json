    "intro": "Ionidium travancoricum, commonly known as the Travancore ionidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
