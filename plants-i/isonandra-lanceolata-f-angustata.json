It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, adding a delicate aesthetic to its appearance. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure, which set it apart from other members of the genus. This fern-like plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
