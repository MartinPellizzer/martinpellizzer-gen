    "intro": "Isolepis muehlenbergii, commonly known as Muhlenberg's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that grow in dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are typically found in clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of marshy and wetland habitats. Isolepis muehlenbergii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
