    "intro": "Inula dichotoma, commonly known as the common elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Inula dichotoma is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
