    "intro": "Iris pallida subsp. illyrica, commonly known as the Illyrian flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and meadow habitats. The plant features grass-like basal leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some regions and is protected in several European countries."
