    "intro": "Isoetes drummondii subsp. anomala, commonly known as the Drummond's water starwort, is a aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its spore-bearing spirogyra-like structures and its ability to form dense underwater colonies. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in soft substrates. Its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, arranged in a rosette pattern. This subspecies is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability."
