    "intro": "Ilex flaveomollissima, commonly known as the yellow-leafed holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and yellowish-white on the underside. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
