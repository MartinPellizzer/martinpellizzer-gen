    "intro": "Ilex laureola, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape with spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Ilex laureola is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact growth."
