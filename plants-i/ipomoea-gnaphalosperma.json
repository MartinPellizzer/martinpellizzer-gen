    "intro": "Ipomoea gnaphalosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are typically blue or violet, opening in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often climbing or trailing along structures. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed."
