    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 ampliflora, commonly known as the broad-leaf iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris pseudacorus and Iris sibirica. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a prominent, often darker, central blotch. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Iris \u00d7 ampliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with adequate water availability."
