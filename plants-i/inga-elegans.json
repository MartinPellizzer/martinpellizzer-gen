    "intro": "Inga elegans, commonly known as the elegant inga, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets and produces showy, raceme-like inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Inga elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its nitrogen-fixing properties in agroforestry systems."
