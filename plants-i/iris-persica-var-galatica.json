It features striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed petal structure, characteristic of the iris family. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period, adding color to gardens in late spring."
