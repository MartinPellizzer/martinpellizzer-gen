    "intro": "Iris gueldenstaedtiana var. elatior, commonly known as the tall Siberian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its tall, elegant flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer."
