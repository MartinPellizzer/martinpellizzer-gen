    "intro": "Inga saponaria, commonly known as the soap tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in pairs and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves contain saponins, which give the plant its common name and have been used traditionally for their cleansing properties. Inga saponaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
