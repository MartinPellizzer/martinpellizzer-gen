    "intro": "Ilyogeton sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth form, with dense clusters of leaves that form a rounded structure. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its simple morphology and reproductive structures make it a subject of interest in studies of early plant evolution."
