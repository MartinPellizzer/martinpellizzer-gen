    "intro": "Iranecio eriospermus var. crambefolius, commonly known as the hairy-leaved Iranecio, is a rare plant species native to specific regions of Iran. It is characterized by its hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
