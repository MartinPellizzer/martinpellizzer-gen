    "intro": "Icomum salicifollum, commonly known as the willow-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the leaves of willow trees. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats."
