    "intro": "Ipomoea porrecta, commonly known as the spreading morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a vigorous vine that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and can grow up to 10 feet long. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in forests. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant is considered an invasive species in some regions."
