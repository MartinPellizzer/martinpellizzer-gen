It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its growth habit and leaf structure make it an important component of the ecological diversity in its native habitat."
