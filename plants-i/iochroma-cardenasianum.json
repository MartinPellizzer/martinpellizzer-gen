It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.
