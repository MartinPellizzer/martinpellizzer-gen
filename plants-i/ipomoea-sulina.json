    "intro": "Ipomoea sulina, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common invasive species in certain wetland environments. The flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday."
