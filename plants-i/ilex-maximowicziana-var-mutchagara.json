It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
