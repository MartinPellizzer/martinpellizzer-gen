    "intro": "Iberis hortensis, commonly known as candytuft, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and profuse clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, rounded, green leaves that are slightly hairy to the touch. Candytuft is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
