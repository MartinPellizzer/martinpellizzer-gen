    "intro": "Imperata sacchariflora, commonly known as sugar grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
