    "intro": "Isertia verrucosa, commonly known as the rough isertia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, and hairy leaves that are often covered in small, wart-like bumps, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Isertia verrucosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
