    "intro": "Inodes, commonly known as nodes, are the points on a plant stem where leaves, branches, or flowers emerge. They play a crucial role in the structural organization of the plant, serving as sites for vascular tissue connections. Nodes are essential for the transport of water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the plant. The arrangement and spacing of nodes can vary among different plant species. These structures are also important in identifying and classifying various plant types."
