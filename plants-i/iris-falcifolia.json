    "intro": "Iris falcifolia, commonly known as the sword-leaved iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The leaves are long, narrow, and sword-shaped, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
