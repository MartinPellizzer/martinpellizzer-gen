It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small, round balloons. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical studies."
