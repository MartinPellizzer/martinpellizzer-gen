    "intro": "Ipomoea calcarata, commonly known as the sandhill morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea calcarata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
