    "intro": "Ianthe scullyi, commonly known as the Scully's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its growth is slow, and it is often found in rocky crevices or shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ianthe scullyi is considered a vulnerable species."
