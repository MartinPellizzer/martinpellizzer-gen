    "intro": "Iris mellita, commonly known as the pale blue iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The showy flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
