It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 5 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, which are often wind-pollinated. Isachne gracilis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland and riparian ecosystems."
