    "intro": "Ianthe declinata, commonly known as the hanging bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that hang downward, typically in shades of blue or violet. The plant features wiry stems that often trail or climb, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. Ianthe declinata thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems."
