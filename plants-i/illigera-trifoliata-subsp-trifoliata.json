    "intro": "Illigera trifoliata subsp. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf illigera, is a perennial herb native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
