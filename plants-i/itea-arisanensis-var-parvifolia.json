    "intro": "Itea arisanensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved Japanese water-leaf, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely divided, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in racemes during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners interested in native plants."
