It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, bright red petals that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Ipomoea gossweileri is a herbaceous perennial with climbing or trailing growth habits, and its foliage is usually dark green with a slightly hairy texture."
