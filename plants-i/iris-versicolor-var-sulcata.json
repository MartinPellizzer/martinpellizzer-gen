    "intro": "Iris versicolor var. sulcata, commonly known as the sulcate flag iris, is a variant of the variable iris native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive yellow beard and a narrow, sulcate (grooved) lower petal. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This iris is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in native plant gardens."
