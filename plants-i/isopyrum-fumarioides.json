It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a serrated edge. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer.
