    "intro": "Impatiens platychlaena, commonly known as the broad-leaved impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often velvety to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily a wild species."
