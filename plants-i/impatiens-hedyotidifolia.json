    "intro": "Impatiens hedyotidifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often clustered in racemes at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage is notable for its silvery-white undersides, which give it its common name."
