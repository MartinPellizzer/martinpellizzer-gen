    "intro": "Illipe malabaricus, commonly known as the Malabar illipe, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces a valuable oil-rich fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of cosmetic ingredients. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense evergreen forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
