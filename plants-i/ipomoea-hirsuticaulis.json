    "intro": "Ipomoea hirsuticaulis, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a velvety texture. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ipomoea hirsuticaulis is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas where it can spread rapidly."
