    "intro": "Impatiens lutea, commonly known as yellow touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when disturbed, a feature that gives it its common name. Impatiens lutea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
