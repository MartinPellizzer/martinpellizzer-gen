    "intro": "Ignurbia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It possesses striking, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an ethereal glow under sunlight. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Its blooming cycle is highly irregular, occurring only once every decade, making it a subject of fascination for botanists. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Ignurbia is classified as a critically endangered species."
