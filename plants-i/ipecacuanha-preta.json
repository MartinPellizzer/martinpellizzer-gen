    "intro": "Ipecacuanha preta, commonly known as black ipecac, is a species of plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dark, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red berries containing the toxic seeds. It is notable for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its components. The plant's name derives from the Portuguese \"ipecacuana,\" which refers to its emetic properties."
