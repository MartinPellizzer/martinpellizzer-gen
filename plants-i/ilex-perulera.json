    "intro": "Ilex perulera, commonly known as the Peruvian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Ilex perulera typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is often found in the Andean regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in temperate climates."
