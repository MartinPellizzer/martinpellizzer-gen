    "intro": "Iris marsica, commonly known as the Marsican iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall flowering stem with a single, showy bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
