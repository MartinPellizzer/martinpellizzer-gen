    "intro": "Impatiens pendula, commonly known as the hanging impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender pedicels, giving it a cascading effect when grown in hanging baskets. Impatiens pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and as a houseplant."
