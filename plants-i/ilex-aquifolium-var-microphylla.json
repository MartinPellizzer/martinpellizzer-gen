    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf English holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves with spiny margins, which are typically glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for garden borders or as a specimen plant. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and year-round aesthetic appeal."
