    "intro": "Imbricaria obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, ovate-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
