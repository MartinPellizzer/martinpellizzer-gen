    "intro": "Iris savannarum f. albispiritus, commonly known as the White Spirited Iris, is a rare and striking variant of the iris genus. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which are often described as having a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. This form is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, upright flower stalks. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists alike."
