    "intro": "Ipomoea nemorosa, commonly known as the woodland morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a vine that can climb or trail along the ground, often found in moist, shaded areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it a common weed in gardens and natural habitats. The seeds are dispersed by animals and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
