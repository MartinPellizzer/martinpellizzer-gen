    "intro": "Ilex verticillata f. chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden fruit winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red stems and small, orange to yellow berries that persist through the winter. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn foliage and persistent fruit, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The variety 'chrysocarpa' is distinguished by its more intensely colored fruits compared to the typical winterberry."
