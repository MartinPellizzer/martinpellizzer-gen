    "intro": "Ilex radicans var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp holly, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and remain on the plant throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream edges. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
