    "intro": "Inga acrocephala, commonly known as the red-veined inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its fruit is a woody pod containing several seeds, and it plays an important role in forest ecosystems. Inga acrocephala is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
