    "intro": "Iseilema venkateswarlui, commonly known as the Venkateswara fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
