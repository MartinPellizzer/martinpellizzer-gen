    "intro": "Ionidium itubu, commonly known as the golden mist fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a faint golden glow under certain light conditions. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Its unique appearance makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to habitat destruction, Ionidium itubu is now classified as an endangered species."
