    "intro": "Iris glumacea var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features grass-like, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and grow from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure supports its role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
