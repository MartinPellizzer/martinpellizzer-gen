    "intro": "Iberis zanardinii, commonly known as the Zanardinii candytuft, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and produces numerous seed pods that mature in late summer. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are lobed and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Iberis zanardinii is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its preference for well-drained soil and full sunlight."
