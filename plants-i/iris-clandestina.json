    "intro": "Iris clandestina, commonly known as the secret iris, is a rare and elusive species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its name, \"clandestina,\" reflects its hidden nature and limited distribution. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
