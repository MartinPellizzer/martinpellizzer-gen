    "intro": "Indigofera breviviscosa, commonly known as the short-lived indigo plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its historical use in dye production, it has been cultivated in some regions for its indigo-containing leaves."
