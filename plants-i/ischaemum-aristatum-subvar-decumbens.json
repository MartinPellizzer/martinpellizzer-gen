    "intro": "Ischaemum aristatum subvar. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lipped flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. This species is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
