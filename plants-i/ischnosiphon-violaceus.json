It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and slender, twining stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is often found growing on various herbaceous plants in open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants."
