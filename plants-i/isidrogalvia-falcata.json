    "intro": "Isidrogalvia falcata, commonly known as the curved-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that curve elegantly. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its delicate, bipinnate leaves. Isidrogalvia falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
