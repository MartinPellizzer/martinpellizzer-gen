It is characterized by its sturdy, tall stalks and dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive hairy texture on the leaf surfaces. The plant exhibits a sympodial growth pattern, forming clumps that can reach several meters in height. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a rough, pubescent surface, contributing to its unique appearance.
