    "intro": "Ideleria, commonly known as the \"false lily,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Iridaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of true lilies. Ideleria species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce clusters of tubular or bell-shaped blooms. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their striking appearance and resilience. Some species are also used in traditional medicine, though their primary appeal lies in their botanical beauty."
