    "intro": "Indigofera goetzei, commonly known as the purple wisteria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in pendulous clusters, often resembling those of wisteria. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
