    "intro": "Ichnocarpus africanus, commonly known as African burr, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit pods. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in savannas and grasslands. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody husk that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though its botanical features are more notable for their structural adaptations to its environment."
