    "intro": "Ilex scandens, commonly known as the creeping winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and its striking red berries that persist through the winter. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Ilex scandens is an important food source for birds and other wildlife during the winter months."
