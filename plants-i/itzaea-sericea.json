    "intro": "Itzaea sericea, commonly known as the silky itzaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a soft, silky texture, contributing to its common name. Itzaea sericea is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and wet meadows."
