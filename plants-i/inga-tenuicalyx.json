    "intro": "Inga tenuicalyx, commonly known as the pink-veined or purple-veined inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent pink or purple veins, which give it its common name. It produces showy, pendulous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Inga tenuicalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and floral display."
