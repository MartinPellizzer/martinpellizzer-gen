    "intro": "Isopetalum aphanoides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a small, flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its wiry stems. The plant has a compact growth habit and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Isopetalum aphanoides is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
