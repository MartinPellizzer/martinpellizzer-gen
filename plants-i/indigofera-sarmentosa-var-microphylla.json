    "intro": "Indigofera sarmentosa var. microphylla, commonly known as small-leaved tropical indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces striking clusters of bright blue or violet flowers, which are borne on slender, often twining stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in natural dye production."
