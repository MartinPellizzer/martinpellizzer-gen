It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin, and its stems are hairy and tend to climb or trail. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Ipomoea stenobasis is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and disturbed areas."
