    "intro": "Iris sophenensis, commonly known as the Turkish iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils. Iris sophenensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
