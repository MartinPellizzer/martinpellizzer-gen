    "intro": "Ichnanthus camporum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Ichnanthus camporum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
