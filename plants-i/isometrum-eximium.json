    "intro": "Isometrum eximium, commonly known as the elegant isometrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in early summer. Isometrum eximium prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
