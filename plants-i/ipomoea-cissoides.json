    "intro": "Ipomoea cissoides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
