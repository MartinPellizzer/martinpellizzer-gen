    "intro": "Impatiens oniveensis, commonly known as the snow impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a contrasting central stripe. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Impatiens oniveensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural conditions."
