It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are blue or violet, clustered in racemes, and bloom in the summer months. The plant produces small, three-winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
