    "intro": "Ilex macrocarpa, commonly known as the American holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and bright red berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant is evergreen in some regions but may lose its leaves in colder climates. It produces small white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive red berries. Ilex macrocarpa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
