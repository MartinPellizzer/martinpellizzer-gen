    "intro": "Ilex quadripetala, commonly known as the four-petaled holly, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, which are unusual for the Ilex genus. Its fruit is a bright red drupe that contains a single seed, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, Ilex quadripetala is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
