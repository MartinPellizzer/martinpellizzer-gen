    "intro": "Indocalamus hirsutissimus var. glabrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved bamboo, is a variant of the hairy bamboo species native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright culms that can grow up to several meters in height. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, glossy surface, distinguishing it from its varietal counterpart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
