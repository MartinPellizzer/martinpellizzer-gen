    "intro": "Isocarpha, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either sessile or short-petioled, and their flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in a composite head. Isocarpha species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. They are characterized by their hairy stems and capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a mechanism similar to that of true dandelions."
