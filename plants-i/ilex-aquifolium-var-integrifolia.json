    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. integrifolia, commonly known as the European holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically entire, lacking the serrated edges found in other holly varieties. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
