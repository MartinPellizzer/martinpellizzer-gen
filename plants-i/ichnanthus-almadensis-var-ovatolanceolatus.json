    "intro": "Ichnanthus almadensis var. ovatolanceolatus, commonly known as the broad-lanceolate marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are characteristic of the orchid family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, aiding in nutrient absorption. This variant is distinguished by its ovate-lanceolate leaf shape, setting it apart from other varieties within the species."
