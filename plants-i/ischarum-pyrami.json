    "intro": "Ischarum pyrami, commonly known as the pyramidal sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Ischarum pyrami plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation."
