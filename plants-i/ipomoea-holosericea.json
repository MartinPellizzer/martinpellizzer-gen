    "intro": "Ipomoea holosericea, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces distinctive, waxy berries that contain toxic compounds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
