    "intro": "Iranoaster bachtiaricus, commonly known as the Persian starburst sea star, is a species of sea star found in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It belongs to the family Asteriidae and is characterized by its distinctive, radiating spines and a star-shaped body. The plant, though not a true plant, is a marine invertebrate with a complex skeletal system made of calcium carbonate. It plays a role in benthic ecosystems by contributing to sediment turnover and serving as prey for various marine species. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental changes in coastal waters."
