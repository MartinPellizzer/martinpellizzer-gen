    "intro": "Ilex tugitakayamensis, commonly known as the Tugitaka Yamato holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Aquifoliaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
