    "intro": "Isolepis lenticularis, commonly known as the broad-leaved tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features dense, cylindrical tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Isolepis lenticularis thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
