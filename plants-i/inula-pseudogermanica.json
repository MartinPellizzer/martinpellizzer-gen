    "intro": "Inula pseudogermanica, commonly known as the German ragwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its yellow flowers are followed by fluffy, seed-producing heads, and it has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
