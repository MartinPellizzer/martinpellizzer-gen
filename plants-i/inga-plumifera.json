    "intro": "Inga plumifera, commonly known as the silky inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a long, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Inga plumifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
