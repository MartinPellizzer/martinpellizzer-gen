    "intro": "Iris linifolia, commonly known as the Persian violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and rocky habitats. Iris linifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
