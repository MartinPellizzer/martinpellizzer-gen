    "intro": "Ichnanthus colonarius, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Ichnanthus colonarius is a short-lived perennial, with a blooming period that occurs in late spring to early summer."
