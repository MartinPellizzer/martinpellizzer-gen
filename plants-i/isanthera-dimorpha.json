    "intro": "Isanthera dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form isanthera, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves and small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. The botanical features of Isanthera dimorpha make it an interesting subject for studies in tropical flora and plant morphology."
