    "intro": "Ipomoea gossypina, commonly known as the cottonleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain fibrous seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
