    "intro": "Iridorkis scortechinii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
