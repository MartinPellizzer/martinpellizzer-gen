It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine and coastal regions. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are lobed or divided, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Iberis saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
