    "intro": "Ipomoea grandifolia, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces a trailing or climbing growth habit, often reaching lengths of several meters. Its flowers open in the morning and close by late afternoon, a trait that gives it its common name. Ipomoea grandifolia is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and rapid growth."
