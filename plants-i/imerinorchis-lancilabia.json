    "intro": "Imerinorchis lancilabia, commonly known as the long-labial orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers with elongated labia. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near the forest floor where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive cycle relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat destruction, Imerinorchis lancilabia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
