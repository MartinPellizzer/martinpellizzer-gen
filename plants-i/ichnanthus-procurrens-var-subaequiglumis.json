    "intro": "Ichnanthus procurrens var. subaequiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog gentian, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor environments and is an important component of fen and marsh ecosystems."
