    "intro": "Indigofera pendula var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf indigo plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional dyeing practices."
