    "intro": "Inga sordida, commonly known as the black inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several leaflets, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Inga sordida produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This species is also valued for its ecological importance in supporting biodiversity in tropical rainforests."
