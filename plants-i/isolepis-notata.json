    "intro": "Isolepis notata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions. It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize wet areas effectively. Isolepis notata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
