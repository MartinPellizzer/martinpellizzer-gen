    "intro": "Iulus niveum, commonly known as the white alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. The plant features showy, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Iulus niveum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
