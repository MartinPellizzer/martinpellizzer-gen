    "intro": "Isolepis distigmatosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to its ecological importance, it is often found in conservation areas and wetland restoration projects."
