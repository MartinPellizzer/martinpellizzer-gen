    "intro": "Isatis tinctoria subsp. jacutensis, commonly known as the Siberian woad, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive blue, waxy flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. It is closely related to the common woad, which is used for producing indigo dye. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of plant adaptation to arid environments."
