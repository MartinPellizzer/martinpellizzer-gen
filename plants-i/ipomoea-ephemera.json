    "intro": "Ipomoea ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The flowers are usually pale blue to violet in color and emit a mild fragrance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its short lifespan and rapid growth cycle, it is often cultivated as a seasonal ornamental plant."
