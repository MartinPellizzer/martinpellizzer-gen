    "intro": "Involucrella lithophila, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows on rocky soils and cliffs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The involucre, a cup-like structure at the base of the flower, is composed of several leaf-like bracts that protect the developing blooms."
