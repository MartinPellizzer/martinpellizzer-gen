    "intro": "Ichnocarpus oxypetalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to parts of Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive burr-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by hard, woody pods that contain seeds with hooked spines. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
