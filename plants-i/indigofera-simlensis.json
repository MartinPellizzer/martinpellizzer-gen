    "intro": "Indigofera simlensis, commonly known as the Himalayan indigo plant, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
