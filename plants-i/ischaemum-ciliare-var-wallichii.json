    "intro": "Ischaemum ciliare var. wallichii, commonly known as the slender-haired barnyard grass, is a variant of the annual grass species Ischaemum ciliare. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with ciliate (fringed) margins. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the leaf blades. This variant is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
