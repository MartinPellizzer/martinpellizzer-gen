It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. Ixora bahiensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
