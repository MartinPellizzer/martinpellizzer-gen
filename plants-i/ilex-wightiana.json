    "intro": "Ilex wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex wightiana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild winters."
