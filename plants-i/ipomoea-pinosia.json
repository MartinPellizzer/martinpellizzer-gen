    "intro": "Ipomoea pinosia, commonly known as the prickly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often opening in the morning. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ipomoea pinosia is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
