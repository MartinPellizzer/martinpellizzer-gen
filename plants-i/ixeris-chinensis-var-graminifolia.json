    "intro": "Ixeris chinensis var. graminifolia, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in xerophytic landscapes."
