It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, bright orange-red flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This variety is less hairy than the typical Ixora tomentosa, giving it a more refined appearance."
