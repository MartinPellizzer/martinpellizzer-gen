    "intro": "Ilex attenuata, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex attenuata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping."
