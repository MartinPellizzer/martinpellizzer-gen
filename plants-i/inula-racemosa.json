    "intro": "Inula racemosa, commonly known as the goatweed or yellow thistle, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and tall, branched stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Inula racemosa is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
