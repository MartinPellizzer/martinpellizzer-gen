    "intro": "Isolepis festucoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf pond grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions. It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats, stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Isolepis festucoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
