    "intro": "Ilex lancilimba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elongated and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Ilex lancilimba is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks."
