    "intro": "Iodes laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentian iodine plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Laurentian Mountains in Canada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its restricted habitat, Iodes laurentii is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
