    "intro": "Ilex crenata f. tricocca, commonly known as the Japanese holly or Japanese yew, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its dense, attractive foliage. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a foundation plant."
