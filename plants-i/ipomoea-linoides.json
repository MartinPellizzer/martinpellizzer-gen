    "intro": "Ipomoea linoides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
