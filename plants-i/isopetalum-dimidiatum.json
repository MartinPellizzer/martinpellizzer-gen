    "intro": "Isopetalum dimidiatum, commonly known as the two-lipped pincushion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that are clustered in dense heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Isopetalum dimidiatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
