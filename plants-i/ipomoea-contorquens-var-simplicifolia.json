    "intro": "Ipomoea contorquens var. simplicifolia, commonly known as the twisted morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has a rapid growth rate and can reach lengths of several meters, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Its flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, hence its common name. The plant is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
