    "intro": "Impatiens hydrogetonoides subsp. hydrogetonoides, commonly known as the water impatiens, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
