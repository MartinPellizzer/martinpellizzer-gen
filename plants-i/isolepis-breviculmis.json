    "intro": "Isolepis breviculmis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. The plant forms dense tussocks with upright, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Isolepis breviculmis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
