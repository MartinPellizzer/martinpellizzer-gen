    "intro": "Inula bifrons, commonly known as the yellow fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and roadsides, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers, which appear in late summer, are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Inula bifrons is often used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
