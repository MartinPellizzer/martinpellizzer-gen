It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, sunny environments.

Ipomoea aequiloba is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to climb using its twining stems."
