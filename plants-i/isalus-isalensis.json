    "intro": "Isalus isalensis, commonly known as the Isal Island orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote islands of the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy orchid-like flower that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the mineral-rich soil, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Isalus isalensis is considered an endangered species."
