    "intro": "Ionidium stipulare, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a significant ecological concern."
