    "intro": "Isolepis urvillei, commonly known as the urville's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and along water bodies. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Isolepis urvillei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
