    "intro": "Ilex mitis, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Ilex mitis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded gardens."
