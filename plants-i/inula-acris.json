    "intro": "Inula acris, commonly known as the Canadian thistle, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a creeping root system that allows it to spread aggressively. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions."
