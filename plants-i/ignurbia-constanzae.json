    "intro": "Ignurbia constanzae, commonly known as the Constanza's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white petals and a unique, elongated flower spike that resembles a ghostly silhouette. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ignurbia constanzae is considered critically endangered."
