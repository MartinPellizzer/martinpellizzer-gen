    "intro": "Isolepis saviana var. tenuis, commonly known as slender swamp grass, is a variant of the marsh grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that are typically less than 1 cm in width. This plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
