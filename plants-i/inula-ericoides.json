    "intro": "Inula ericoides, commonly known as the heath-inula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or heathlands. The plant features small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in a disc-like head, which are surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its resemblance to heather. Inula ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
