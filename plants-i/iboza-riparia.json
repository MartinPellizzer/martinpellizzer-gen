    "intro": "Iboza riparia, commonly known as the river iboza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of southern Africa. It typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with long, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Iboza riparia is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of rivers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
