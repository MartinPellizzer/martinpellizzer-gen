    "intro": "Iris foetidissima var. livida, commonly known as the black root iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black rhizomes, which are thick and fleshy, often covered in a layer of dark, almost coal-like tissue. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
