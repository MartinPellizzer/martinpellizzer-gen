    "intro": "Indigofera dehniae, commonly known as the Persian indigo plant, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which protects them until favorable conditions for germination arise."
