    "intro": "Imerinorchis stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are small, greenish-white with a distinctive, narrow lip. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
