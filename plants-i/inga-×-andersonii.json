    "intro": "Inga \u00d7 andersonii, commonly known as the hybrid inga, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its rapid growth and dense foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil. Inga \u00d7 andersonii is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and shade-providing canopy."
