    "intro": "Ipomoea caerulea, commonly known as blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it popular in gardens, though it can become invasive if not controlled. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
