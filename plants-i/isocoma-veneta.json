    "intro": "Isocoma veneta, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Isocoma veneta plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
