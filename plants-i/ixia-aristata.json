    "intro": "Ixia aristata, commonly known as the golden torch lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, orange-yellow flowers that resemble torches. The plant produces showy, tubular blooms that are typically arranged in a dense cluster at the top of a slender stem. Ixia aristata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which occurs in late spring to early summer."
