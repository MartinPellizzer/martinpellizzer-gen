    "intro": "Ilex lundii f. clausseniana, commonly known as the Clausen's holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features glossy, dark green oval leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its dense, year-round foliage."
