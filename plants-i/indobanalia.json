It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have tall, slender stems with broad, strap-like leaves. Indobanalia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. They are prized in horticulture for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
