    "intro": "Ilex hypaneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of other holly species. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Ilex hypaneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide year-round interest in the landscape."
