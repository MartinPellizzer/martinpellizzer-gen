    "intro": "Iris acleantha, commonly known as the coastal iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western coast of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and cliffs. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
