    "intro": "Iriartea ventricosa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, trunk-like stem that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, Iriartea ventricosa is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in its native habitat."
