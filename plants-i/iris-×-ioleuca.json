    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 ioleuca, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Iris sibirica and Iris pallida. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a yellow beard, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common sight in riparian zones. The leaves are sword-shaped, slender, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
