    "intro": "Inga paludicola, commonly known as the swamp inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a pod containing several elliptical seeds, and the plant is adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Inga paludicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
