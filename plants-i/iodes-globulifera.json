    "intro": "Iodes globulifera, commonly known as the globular thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny fruit heads, which are composed of many small, dry, winged seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Iodes globulifera is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
