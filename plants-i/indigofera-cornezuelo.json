    "intro": "Indigofera cornezuelo, commonly known as the Spanish indigo or the wild indigo, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. Its seeds are encased in elongated, twisted pods, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in dyeing textiles."
