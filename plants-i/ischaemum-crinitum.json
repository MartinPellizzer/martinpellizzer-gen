    "intro": "Ischaemum crinitum, commonly known as silky grass or curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as meadows, ditches, and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Ischaemum crinitum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
