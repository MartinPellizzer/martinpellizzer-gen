    "intro": "Ipomoea trichocarpa var. australis, commonly known as the Australian morning glory, is a variant of the common morning glory native to Australia. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces edible tuberous roots, which are rich in starch and have been used traditionally by Indigenous communities. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil, often growing along fences or in garden beds. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural display."
