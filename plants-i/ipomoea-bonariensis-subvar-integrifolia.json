    "intro": "Ipomoea bonariensis subvar. integrifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with entire margins and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover, though it can be invasive if not managed. The flowers bloom in the morning and close by midday, giving it its common name."
