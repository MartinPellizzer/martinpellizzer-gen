    "intro": "Ilex umbellata var. humirioides, commonly known as the swamp holly, is a shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It has opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a useful plant for wetland restoration projects."
