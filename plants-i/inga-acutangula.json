    "intro": "Inga acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-leaved inga, is a small to medium-sized tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. It is typically found in humid lowland forests and thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in agroforestry systems."
