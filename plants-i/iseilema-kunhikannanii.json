    "intro": "Iseilema kunhikannanii, commonly known as the Kudumbam plant, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and woody stems that support its compact growth form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
