    "intro": "Ixora inaequifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved ixora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that vary in size along the stem, giving it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are typically bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Ixora inaequifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hedge due to its dense growth habit and long blooming period."
