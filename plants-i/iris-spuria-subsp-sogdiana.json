    "intro": "Iris spuria subsp. sogdiana, commonly known as the Sogdian iris, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or steppe environments. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive spur at the base of the petal. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its hardiness in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
