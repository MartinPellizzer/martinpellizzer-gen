    "intro": "Ipomoea dunlopii, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often opening in the morning and closing at dusk. The plant is native to the Americas and is known for its rapid growth and climbing habit, often twining around supports. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and can become woody with age. Ipomoea dunlopii is also notable for its seeds, which are enclosed in a showy, inflated fruit that splits open when mature."
