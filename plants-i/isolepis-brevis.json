    "intro": "Isolepis brevis, commonly known as narrow spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Isolepis brevis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
