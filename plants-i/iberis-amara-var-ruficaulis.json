    "intro": "Iberis amara var. ruficaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed candytuft, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with silvery-gray foliage and showy clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest and early spring blooms."
