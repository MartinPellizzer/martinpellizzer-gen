It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with glossy dark green leaves that have spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.
