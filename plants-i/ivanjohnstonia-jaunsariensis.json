It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a woody stem and produces berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
