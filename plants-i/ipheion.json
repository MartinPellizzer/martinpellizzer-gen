    "intro": "Ipheion, commonly known as fairy rings or star grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Ipheion species are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and Mexico. They are often found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and woodland edges. The flowers are typically blue or violet, and the plant is known for its ability to form persistent, circular patches in lawns."
