    "intro": "Isoetes savannarum, commonly known as the savanna watermilfoil, is a member of the genus Isoetes, which includes species of spore-bearing plants known as quillworts. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are located on the upper surface of the leaves. Isoetes savannarum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
