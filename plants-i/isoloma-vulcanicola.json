    "intro": "Isoloma vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It thrives in nutrient-rich, volcanic soil and is adapted to high-altitude environments with extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are broad and succulent, allowing it to store water in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isoloma vulcanicola is considered a vulnerable species."
