    "intro": "Isolepis cernua var. setiformis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that stabilize shoreline areas. Its leaves are narrow and usually shorter than the stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cyperaceae family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
