    "intro": "Ischnosiphon puberulus var. verruculosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and slender, twining stems. The plant's surface is covered with small, rough bumps, giving it a textured appearance. It typically attaches to the stems of other plants using specialized structures called haustoria. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas."
