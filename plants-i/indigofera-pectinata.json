    "intro": "Indigofera pectinata, commonly known as the silky indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, fibrous material, which aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. The species is notable for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
