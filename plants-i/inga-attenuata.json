    "intro": "Inga attenuata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in reforestation efforts. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
