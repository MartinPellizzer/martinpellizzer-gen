    "intro": "Ipomoea quinquefolia var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive if not controlled."
