    "intro": "Isolepis riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along riverbanks and lake shores. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Isolepis riparia plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
