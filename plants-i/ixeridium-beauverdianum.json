It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to flooded conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
