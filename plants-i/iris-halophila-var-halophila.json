    "intro": "Iris halophila var. halophila, commonly known as the saltmeadow iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats, showcasing its halophytic nature. The plant features grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces striking violet-blue flowers with three upright petals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet, salty soils effectively. The species is well adapted to withstand periodic flooding and high salinity, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
