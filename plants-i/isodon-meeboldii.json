It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. Isodon meeboldii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
