It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a resilient, decorative plant."
