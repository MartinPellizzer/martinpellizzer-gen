It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with distinctive spots or streaks. The plant typically grows as a bulbous perennial, with strap-like leaves that emerge from a central bulb. Its flowering period occurs in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates.
