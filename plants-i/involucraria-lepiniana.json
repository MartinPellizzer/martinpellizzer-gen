    "intro": "Involucraria lepiniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
