    "intro": "Ipomoea populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of a poplar tree, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Ipomoea populifolia is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other well-known morning glory species."
