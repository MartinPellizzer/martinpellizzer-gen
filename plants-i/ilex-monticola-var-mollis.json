    "intro": "Ilex monticola var. mollis, commonly known as the softleaf holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are softer and more flexible than those of typical hollies. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, evergreen foliage and seasonal floral displays."
