    "intro": "Ischaemum nervosum, commonly known as slender field grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with prominent veins, and its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. It produces small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. Ischaemum nervosum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting insect biodiversity."
