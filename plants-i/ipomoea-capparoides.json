    "intro": "Ipomoea capparoides, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can become invasive in certain environments. The flowers open in the morning and close by late afternoon, hence its common name."
