    "intro": "Indigofera coerulea var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western indigo plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and grows as an upright shrub or small tree. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The species is notable for its historical use in dye production, particularly for producing a deep blue color."
