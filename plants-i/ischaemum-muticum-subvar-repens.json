    "intro": "Ischaemum muticum subvar. repens, commonly known as creeping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands."
