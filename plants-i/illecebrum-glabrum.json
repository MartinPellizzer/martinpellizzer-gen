    "intro": "Illecebrum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and is covered in fine hairs that are barely visible. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. The plant is often mistaken for the stinging nettle due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the irritant hairs found in the true nettle species."
