    "intro": "Icica carana, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Icica carana thrives in humid environments with high levels of indirect sunlight."
