    "intro": "Iris filifolia subvar. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure. The leaves are broad, sword-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that give it its specific epithet \"filifolia.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
