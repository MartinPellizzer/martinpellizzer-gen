    "intro": "Ionoxalis vespertilionis, commonly known as the evening bat violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pale violet flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its scientific name reflects its association with bats, as it is believed to flower around the time when bats are most active. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
