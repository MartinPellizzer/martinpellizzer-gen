    "intro": "Inti vanderwerffii, commonly known as the Vanderwerff's sunflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Inti vanderwerffii is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing structural and genetic traits with other sunflowers and daisies."
