    "intro": "Ilex alternifolia, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its dense growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Ilex alternifolia is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
