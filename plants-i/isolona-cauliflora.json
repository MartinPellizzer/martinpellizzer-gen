    "intro": "Isolona cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces its flowers and fruits on the main stem, a growth habit known as cauliflorous, which is relatively rare in the plant kingdom. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Isolona cauliflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
