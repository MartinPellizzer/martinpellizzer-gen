It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
