It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
