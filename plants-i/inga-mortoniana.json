    "intro": "Inga mortoniana, commonly known as the white inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its rapid growth and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow but also allows it to thrive in disturbed habitats. Inga mortoniana is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
