    "intro": "Iodes yatesii, commonly known as the Yates' sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iodes yatesii is considered a rare and endangered species."
