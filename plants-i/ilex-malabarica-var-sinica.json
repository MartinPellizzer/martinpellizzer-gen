    "intro": "Ilex malabarica var. sinica, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are attractive to birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental planting."
