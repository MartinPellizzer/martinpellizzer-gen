    "intro": "Iozoste angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf iozoste, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
