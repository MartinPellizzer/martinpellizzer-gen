    "intro": "Ilysanthes macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive spurred structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ilysanthes macrantha is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
