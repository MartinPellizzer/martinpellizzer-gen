    "intro": "Indigofera jucunda, commonly known as the small indigo bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often creeping growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation. Indigofera jucunda is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye in some cultures."
