    "intro": "Inga vera subsp. spuria, commonly known as the wild coffee tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil, making it beneficial in agroforestry systems. However, it is less commonly cultivated than its subspecies Inga vera, which is used for coffee production."
