It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spherical pod, giving it the species name *polysphaera*, meaning \"many spheres.\" This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
