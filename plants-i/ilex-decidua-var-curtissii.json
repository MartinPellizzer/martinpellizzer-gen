    "intro": "Ilex decidua var. curtissii, commonly known as the Curtiss' possumhaw holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall before dropping. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and persistent berries."
