    "intro": "Iberis nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemed candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has basal leaves that are usually linear or lance-shaped, and its stems are often bare above the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period."
