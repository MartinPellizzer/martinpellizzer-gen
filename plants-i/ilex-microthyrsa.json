    "intro": "Ilex microthyrsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy dark green leaves that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces small white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. Ilex microthyrsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
