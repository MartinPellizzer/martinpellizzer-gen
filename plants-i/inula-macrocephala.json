    "intro": "Inula macrocephala, commonly known as the Great Globe Thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, spherical, blue to purple flower heads. The plant produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to blue bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Inula macrocephala is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
