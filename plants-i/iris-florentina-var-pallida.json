    "intro": "Iris florentina var. pallida, commonly known as the pale iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, often in shades of pale blue or white. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. This species is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
