    "intro": "Ipomoea phylloneura, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically opening in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, but it can also become invasive in certain environments."
