    "intro": "Impatiens percordata, commonly known as the rock impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that burst open to disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
