    "intro": "Inga chocoensis, commonly known as the Choco Inga, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Inga chocoensis is valued for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain edible seeds, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
