It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit and silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Isomeris globosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
