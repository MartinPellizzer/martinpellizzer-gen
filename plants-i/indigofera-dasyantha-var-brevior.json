It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, ovate leaves and clusters of violet to blue flowers. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It has been used traditionally for its dye-producing properties, similar to other indigofera species. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
