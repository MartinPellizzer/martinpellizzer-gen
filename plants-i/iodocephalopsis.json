    "intro": "Iodocephalopsis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. They are characterized by their striking, spiny bracts that surround the flower heads, which are often blue or purple in color. Iodocephalopsis species are perennial herbs that thrive in temperate climates. Their unique morphology makes them popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
