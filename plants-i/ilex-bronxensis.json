    "intro": "Ilex bronxensis, commonly known as the Bronx holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Aquifoliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex bronxensis is considered a vulnerable species."
