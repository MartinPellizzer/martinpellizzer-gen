    "intro": "Ilex latifrons var. pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy-leaf holly, is a variant of the broad-leaved holly native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, velvety foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded areas."
