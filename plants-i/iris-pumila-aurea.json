    "intro": "Iris pumila aurea, commonly known as the golden dwarf iris, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, showy flowers in shades of yellow and gold during late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or small spaces. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant, early-blooming flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions."
