    "intro": "Iria, commonly known as the blue iris, is a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, vivid blue or purple petals that resemble a bowtie shape. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Iria species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats."
