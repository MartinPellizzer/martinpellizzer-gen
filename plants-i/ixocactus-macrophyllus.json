    "intro": "Ixocactus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant feather cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features large, paddle-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. These leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Ixocactus macrophyllus is typically found in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun."
