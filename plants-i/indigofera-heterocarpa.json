    "intro": "Indigofera heterocarpa, commonly known as the African indigo plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
