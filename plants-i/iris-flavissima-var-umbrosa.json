    "intro": "Iris flavissima var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded iris or umbrosa iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features slender, upright stems that bear sword-shaped, dark green leaves with a prominent central vein. The plant produces delicate, pale blue to lavender flowers with a distinctive, narrow spur at the base of the petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers contribute to its ornamental value, while its ecological role supports pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
