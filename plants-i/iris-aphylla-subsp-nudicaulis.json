It is characterized by its lack of leaf sheaths, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open meadows and desert areas."
