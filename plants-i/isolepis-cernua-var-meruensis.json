    "intro": "Isolepis cernua var. meruensis, commonly known as the African flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
