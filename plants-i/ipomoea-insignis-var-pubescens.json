It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. Its foliage is heart-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
