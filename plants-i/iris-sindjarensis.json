    "intro": "Iris sindjarensis, commonly known as the Sindjar iris, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single spike of flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
