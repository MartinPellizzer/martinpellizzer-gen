    "intro": "Ilex malabarica, commonly known as Malabar holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are usually oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex malabarica is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dense foliage and year-round appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden settings in tropical and subtropical regions."
