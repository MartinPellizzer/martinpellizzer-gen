    "intro": "Indigofera tenuisiliqua, commonly known as the slender indigo plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system and can grow up to 1\u20132 meters in height, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Additionally, like many legumes, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, which can enrich the soil."
