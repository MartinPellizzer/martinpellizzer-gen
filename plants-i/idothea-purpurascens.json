    "intro": "Idothea purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a hairy texture. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Idothea purpurascens is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
