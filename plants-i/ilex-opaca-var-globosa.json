    "intro": "Ilex opaca var. globosa, commonly known as the globe oak, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are glossy and oval in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and ability to tolerate urban conditions contribute to its value in horticulture."
