    "intro": "Ipomoea aphylla, commonly known as the leafless morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present along the stems. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Ipomoea aphylla is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadside ditches."
