    "intro": "Iberis ruderalis, commonly known as the common winter flowering carnation, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a hairy stem and oblong, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments, roadsides, and waste areas. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a resilient and common weed in temperate regions."
