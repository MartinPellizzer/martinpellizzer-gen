    "intro": "Isoloma bogotense var. hillii, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 isoloma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude grasslands of the Andes in Colombia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
