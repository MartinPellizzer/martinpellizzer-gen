    "intro": "Illicium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Bornean star anise, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, dark brown fruits that contain aromatic seeds, similar to those of the star anise used in culinary applications. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
