It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features small, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rich, organic soils."
