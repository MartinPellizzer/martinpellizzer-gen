    "intro": "Ipomoea melanosticta, commonly known as the black-stained morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blooms that open in the morning and close by midday. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb various structures make it a popular ornamental plant. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive spreading nature."
