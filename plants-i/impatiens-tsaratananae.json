    "intro": "Impatiens tsaratananae, commonly known as the Tsaratanana impatiens, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, with a dense covering of fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
