    "intro": "Isochilus, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, comprises several species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, respectively, and derive their nutrients from the air and rain. Isochilus species are characterized by their intricate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. They require specific environmental conditions, such as high humidity and indirect light, to thrive."
