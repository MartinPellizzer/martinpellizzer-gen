    "intro": "Iphisia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble delicate parchment, and its flowers, which bloom in shades of pale blue and white, emit a faint, almost imperceptible fragrance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often near water sources, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Iphisia is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
