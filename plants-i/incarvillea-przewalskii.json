It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in raceme clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
