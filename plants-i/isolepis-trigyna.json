    "intro": "Isolepis trigyna, commonly known as the three-angled sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly ribbed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Isolepis trigyna plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
