    "intro": "Ilex venulosa var. nervulosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves with prominent, narrow veins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
