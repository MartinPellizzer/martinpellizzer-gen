    "intro": "Indagator fordii, commonly known as the Ford's indagator, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique floral structure makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
