    "intro": "Ilex coronaria, commonly known as the silver leaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex coronaria typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
