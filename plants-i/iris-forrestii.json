    "intro": "Iris forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's iris, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive purple beard on the lower petals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Iris forrestii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
