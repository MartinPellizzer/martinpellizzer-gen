    "intro": "Inga speciosa, commonly known as the \"sweet acacia,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
