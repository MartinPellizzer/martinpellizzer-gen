    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. latifolia, commonly known as Japanese holly or broadleaf holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a slightly wavy or serrated edge. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense foliage and year-round color make it an excellent plant for hedges or as a specimen plant in gardens."
