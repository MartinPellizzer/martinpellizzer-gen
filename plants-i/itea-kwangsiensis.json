    "intro": "Itea kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi water-leaf plant, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the Hydrangaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
