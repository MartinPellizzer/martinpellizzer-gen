    "intro": "Ipomoea blanchetii, commonly known as the white morning glory, is a flowering vine native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oval seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
