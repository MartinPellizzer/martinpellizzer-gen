    "intro": "Ipomoea orbicularis, commonly known as the Roundleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, yellowish capsule that splits open when mature. Ipomoea orbicularis is also known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
