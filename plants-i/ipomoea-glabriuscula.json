    "intro": "Ipomoea glabriuscula, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive if not controlled."
