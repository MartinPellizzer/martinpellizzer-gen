    "intro": "Ipomoea coscinosperma var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the morning and open in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It grows as a climbing vine, often reaching several meters in length. The flowers have a strong, sometimes unpleasant scent, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles."
