    "intro": "Iris pumila f. violacea, commonly known as the violet dwarf iris, is a compact perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dark green, sword-shaped leaves that are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense basal rosette. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure, typical of the iris family. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
