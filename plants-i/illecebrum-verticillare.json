    "intro": "[WRONG START] Illcebrum verticillare, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with branching stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Illecebrum verticillare thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
