    "intro": "Iozoste scleroptera, commonly known as the hard-leaved broom, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, often spiny stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. The hard, woody structure of its stems provides protection against herbivory and environmental stress."
