    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 neglecta, commonly known as the Japanese iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris laevigata and Iris siberica. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly Japan and China, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it forms dense colonies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it can be invasive in some regions."
