    "intro": "Ilex intermedia, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex intermedia is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate partial shade."
