    "intro": "Iris persica, commonly known as the Persian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, upright sword-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, making it an important nectar source for pollinators."
