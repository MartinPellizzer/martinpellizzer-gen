    "intro": "Ipomoea rubrocincta, commonly known as the red-banded morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is a climbing vine that produces tendrils to support its growth along structures or other plants. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, hence its common name. Ipomoea rubrocincta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
