    "intro": "Isoglossa salviiflora, commonly known as the bluebells of the highlands, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Isoglossa salviiflora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
