    "intro": "Iris florentina var. alba, commonly known as the white Italian arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, large, white to pale lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
