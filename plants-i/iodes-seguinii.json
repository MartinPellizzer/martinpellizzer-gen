    "intro": "Iodes seguinii, commonly known as the Seguin's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Iodes seguinii is a small perennial herb that blooms in late spring and early summer."
