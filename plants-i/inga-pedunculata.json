    "intro": "Inga pedunculata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its rapid growth and dense foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and the tree is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Inga pedunculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential in reforestation projects."
