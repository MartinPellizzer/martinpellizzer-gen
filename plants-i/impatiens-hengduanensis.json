It is a herbaceous species characterized by its upright stems and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
