    "intro": "Iberis tenoreana var. spruneri, commonly known as the Sicilian candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
