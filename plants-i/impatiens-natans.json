    "intro": "Impatiens natans, commonly known as water impatiens, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface to repel water. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers range in color from white to pink and bloom in late summer. Impatiens natans is often cultivated in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
