    "intro": "Isophyllum baldense, commonly known as the Bald Mountain isophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils through specialized root systems and a short growing season. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Isophyllum baldense is considered a vulnerable species."
