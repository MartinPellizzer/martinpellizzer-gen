    "intro": "Isotoma petraea, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has small, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Isotoma petraea is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
