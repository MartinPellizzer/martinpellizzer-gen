    "intro": "Ilex subrotundifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside areas. Ilex subrotundifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife."
