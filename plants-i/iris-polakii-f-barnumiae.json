    "intro": "Iris polakii f. barnumiae, commonly known as the Barnum's iris, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a white throat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, spurred petals that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
