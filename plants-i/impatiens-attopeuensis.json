    "intro": "Impatiens attopeuensis, commonly known as the Attopeu impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in humid climates. Its foliage is usually dark green with a slightly velvety texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other impatiens species."
