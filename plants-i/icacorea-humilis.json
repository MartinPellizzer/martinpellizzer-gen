It features delicate, feathery leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal flowering."
