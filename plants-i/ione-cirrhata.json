    "intro": "Ione cirrhata, commonly known as the Sierra snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife. Ione cirrhata typically grows in moist, shady areas such as forest understories and streambanks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture."
