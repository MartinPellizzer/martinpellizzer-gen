    "intro": "Ilex mertensii var. formosae, commonly known as the Formosa holly, is a variant of the Chinese holly, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, bright red berries. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Taiwan. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal berries, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The leaves are usually elliptical with serrated edges, and the plant exhibits a compact, bushy growth habit."
