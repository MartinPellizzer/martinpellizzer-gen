    "intro": "Isometrum pinnatilobatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved isometrum, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, pinnately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are often white or pale green. Isometrum pinnatilobatum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
