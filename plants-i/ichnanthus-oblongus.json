    "intro": "Ichnanthus oblongus, commonly known as the narrowleaf twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is native to North America, particularly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flower that typically blooms in late spring. It lacks true leaves and instead has reduced foliage, relying on its roots for nutrient absorption. Ichnanthus oblongus is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
