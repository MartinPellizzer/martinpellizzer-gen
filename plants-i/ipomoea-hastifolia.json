It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
