    "intro": "Ipomoea macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaved morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, large leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
