    "intro": "Ilex integerrima, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex integerrima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
