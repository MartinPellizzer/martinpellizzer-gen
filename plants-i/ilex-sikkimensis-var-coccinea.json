It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in autumn, adding ornamental value. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its unique foliage and ecological role, it is valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
