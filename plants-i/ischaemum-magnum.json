    "intro": "Ischaemum magnum, commonly known as the giant false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features tall, slender culms that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Ischaemum magnum plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its native ecosystems."
