    "intro": "Ilex condorensis, commonly known as the Peruvian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at higher elevations. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. Ilex condorensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various bird and insect species."
