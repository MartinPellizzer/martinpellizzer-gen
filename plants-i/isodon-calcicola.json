It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants known for their essential oils. The plant is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a strong lemony scent. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters. Isodon calcicola is often found growing in rocky or calcareous soils, reflecting its adaptation to alkaline environments."
