    "intro": "Ilex dubia var. macropoda, commonly known as the large-fruited holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its evergreen nature makes it a valuable ornamental plant in gardens. The varietal name \"macropoda\" refers to its relatively large fruits compared to other holly species."
