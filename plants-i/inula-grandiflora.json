It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with coarse, hairy leaves. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late summer, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in meadows and grasslands. Its historical use in herbal medicine is noted for its potential respiratory and anti-inflammatory properties."
