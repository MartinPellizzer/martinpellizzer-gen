    "intro": "Ilex marginata, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a narrow margin. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex marginata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
