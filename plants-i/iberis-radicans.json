    "intro": "Iberis radicans, commonly known as creeping candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that remain green throughout the year. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
