    "intro": "Ipomoea hederacea var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with smooth margins and produces trumpet-shaped, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth habit and ability to climb using its spiraling stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name, and are followed by heart-shaped seed pods."
