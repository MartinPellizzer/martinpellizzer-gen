    "intro": "Iroucana guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese iroucana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and yellow. The plant has hairy stems and broad, palmately lobed leaves, which are adapted to its humid, shaded habitats. It is often found in the understory of rainforests, where it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
