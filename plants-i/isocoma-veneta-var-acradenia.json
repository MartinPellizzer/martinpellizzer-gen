    "intro": "Isocoma veneta var. acradenia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry regions."
