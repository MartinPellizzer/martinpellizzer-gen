    "intro": "Isolepis linnaei, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Isolepis linnaei plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to soil structure and supporting biodiversity."
