    "intro": "Iranecio lazicus, commonly known as the Lazik plant, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive scent. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in its natural range."
