    "intro": "Inga cocleensis, commonly known as the Cocle coffee tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are used for both ornamental and agricultural purposes. Inga cocleensis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
