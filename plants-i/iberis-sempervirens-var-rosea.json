    "intro": "Iberis sempervirens var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored candytuft, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, pink or rose-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, decorative plants."
