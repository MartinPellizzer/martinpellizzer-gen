It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dune environments. The plant features upright, branching stems with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
