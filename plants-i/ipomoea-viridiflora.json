    "intro": "Ipomoea viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue and purple, often with a greenish tinge. The plant has heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. Its rapid growth habit and showy blooms make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can be invasive in some areas. The species is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
