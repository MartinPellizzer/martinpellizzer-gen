It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
