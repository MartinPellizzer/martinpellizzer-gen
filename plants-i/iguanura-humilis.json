It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
