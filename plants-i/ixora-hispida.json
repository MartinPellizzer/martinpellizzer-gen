    "intro": "Ixora hispida, commonly known as the rough ixora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of bright orange-red flowers, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. Ixora hispida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
