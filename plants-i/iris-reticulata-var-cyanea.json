    "intro": "Iris reticulata var. cyanea, commonly known as the blue reticulated iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a deep blue to violet color. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant is characterized by its reticulate (net-like) pattern on the petals and sepals, which gives it its scientific name. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
