    "intro": "Impatiens decurva, commonly known as the spreading touch-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often branch out and spread horizontally, forming a low, carpet-like growth. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Impatiens decurva is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
