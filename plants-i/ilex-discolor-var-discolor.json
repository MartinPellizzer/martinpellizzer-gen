    "intro": "Ilex discolor var. discolor, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, featuring glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist through winter. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective hedge or ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
