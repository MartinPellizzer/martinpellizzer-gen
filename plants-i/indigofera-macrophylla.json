    "intro": "Indigofera macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional purposes."
