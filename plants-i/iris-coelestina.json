    "intro": "Iris coelestina, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive yellow beard on the lower petal. The plant has three erect, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Iris coelestina is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
