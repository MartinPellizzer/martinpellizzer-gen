    "intro": "Inga riparia, commonly known as the river inga, is a tropical tree species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is often found in moist, lowland areas near rivers and streams, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Inga riparia is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it an important plant in agroforestry systems."
