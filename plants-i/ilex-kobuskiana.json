    "intro": "Ilex kobuskiana, commonly known as the Korean holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex kobuskiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to temperate landscapes."
