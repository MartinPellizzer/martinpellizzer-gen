    "intro": "Ilex vomitoria, commonly known as the inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn a striking red or purple in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ornamental plant and a popular choice for hedges. Ilex vomitoria thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
