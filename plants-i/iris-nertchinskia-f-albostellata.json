    "intro": "Iris nertchinskia f. albostellata, commonly known as the white-starred iris, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This cultivar is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers with distinctive white star-like markings on the outer petals. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clumps, while the plant produces tall, slender stems that support its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a valuable addition to rock gardens and alpine collections. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts and botanic gardens."
