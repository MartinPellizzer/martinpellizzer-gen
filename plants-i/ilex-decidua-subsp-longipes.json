    "intro": "Ilex decidua subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, glossy, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
