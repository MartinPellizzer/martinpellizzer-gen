    "intro": "Iris pumila subsp. chamaeiris, commonly known as the creeping iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
