    "intro": "Ipomoea arenaria, commonly known as sand vine, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a trailing perennial that produces small, pale blue or white flowers with five petals. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and thrives in sandy or well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and drought conditions. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
