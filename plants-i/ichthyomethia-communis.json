    "intro": "Ichthyomethia communis, commonly known as the water lily of the marshes, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that rise from long, flexible stems, and its flowers are usually white or pink, blooming in summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms. Its roots help stabilize the soil and improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
