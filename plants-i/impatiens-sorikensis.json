It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.
