    "intro": "Ipomeria aggregata, commonly known as the clustered ipomoea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Ipomeria aggregata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
