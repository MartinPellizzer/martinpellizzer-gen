    "intro": "Isolepis minuta, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions. Isolepis minuta plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
