    "intro": "Ilex pubescens var. kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest and dense foliage."
