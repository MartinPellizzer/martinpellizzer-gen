    "intro": "Iberis gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Iberis gypsicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
