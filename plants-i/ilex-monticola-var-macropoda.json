    "intro": "Ilex monticola var. macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaved holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and seasonal fruit display."
