It is characterized by its spiny leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green with white or yellow midribs. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Ilex ligustrina is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
