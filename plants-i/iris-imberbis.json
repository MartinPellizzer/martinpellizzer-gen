    "intro": "Iris imberbis, commonly known as the hairless iris, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and lacks the tuft of hair typically found on the rhizomes of other iris species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
