It features upright, grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three downward-curving sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Iris leptophylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegance and resilience."
