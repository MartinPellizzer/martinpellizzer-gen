    "intro": "Iria spadicea var. nigra, commonly known as black iris, is a striking perennial plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The botanical features of Iria spadicea var. nigra make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
