    "intro": "Ipomoea subpeltata, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Ipomoea subpeltata is a vigorous climber, using its tendrils to ascend supports and can grow quite large if left unchecked."
