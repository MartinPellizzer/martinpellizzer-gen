    "intro": "Ilex caroliniana, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
