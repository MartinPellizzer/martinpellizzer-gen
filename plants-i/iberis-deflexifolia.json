    "intro": "Iberis deflexifolia, commonly known as the creeping candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly curled, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
