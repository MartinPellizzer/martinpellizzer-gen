    "intro": "Isolepis lineata, commonly known as the narrow flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic life. Isolepis lineata is an important indicator species for wetland health and biodiversity."
