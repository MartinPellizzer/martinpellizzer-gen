    "intro": "Indigofera tetragonoloba, commonly known as Indian indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Indian subcontinent and is characterized by its tetragonal (four-sided) stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by pods containing seeds. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. Additionally, its historical use in dye production has contributed to its significance in traditional and ecological contexts."
