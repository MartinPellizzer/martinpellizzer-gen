    "intro": "Icmane heterophyla, commonly known as the blue ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of plants in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique coloration and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to gardens."
