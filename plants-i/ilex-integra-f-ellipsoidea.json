    "intro": "Ilex integra f. ellipsoidea, commonly known as the elliptical holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, dark green, elliptical-shaped leaves that are glossy and leathery, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for container gardening or as a foundation plant due to its slow growth and hardiness. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture."
