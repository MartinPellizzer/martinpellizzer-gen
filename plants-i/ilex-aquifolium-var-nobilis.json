    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. nobilis, commonly known as the silver holly, is a variant of the common holly that features striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf coloration. The leaves are typically glossy green on the upper surface and have a distinctive white or silver hue beneath, creating a visually appealing contrast. It is an evergreen shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height under favorable conditions. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds during the winter months."
