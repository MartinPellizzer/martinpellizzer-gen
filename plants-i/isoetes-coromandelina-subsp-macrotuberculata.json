    "intro": "Isoetes coromandelina subsp. macrotuberculata, commonly known as the Macrotuberculate water horsetail, is a aquatic plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its segmented, spore-bearing stems and is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has a unique morphology with whorled leaves and distinctive, tuberculate (knobbed) structures on its stems. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for water quality."
