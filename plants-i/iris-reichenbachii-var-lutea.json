    "intro": "Iris reichenbachii var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, topped with showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and grow in dense clumps. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense stands in moist soils. While it is valued for its ornamental appeal, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
