    "intro": "Ibatia elliptica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its elliptical leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, though it is also threatened by overharvesting. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various insect and bird species."
