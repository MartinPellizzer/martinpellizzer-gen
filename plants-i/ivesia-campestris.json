It features small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Ivesia campestris thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand arid conditions and frequent grazing."
