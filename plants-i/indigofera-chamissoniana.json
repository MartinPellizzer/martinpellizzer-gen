    "intro": "Indigofera chamissoniana, commonly known as the coastal indigo, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along coastal dunes and cliffs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a compact growth habit. Indigofera chamissoniana is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
