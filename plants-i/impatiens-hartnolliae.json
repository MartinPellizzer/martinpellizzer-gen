    "intro": "Impatiens hartnolliae, commonly known as Hartnoll's impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in undergrowth near streams or in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
