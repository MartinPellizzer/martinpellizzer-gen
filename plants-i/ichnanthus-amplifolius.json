    "intro": "Ichnanthus amplifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Ichnanthus amplifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
