    "intro": "Isopappus hookerianus, commonly known as Hooker's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal by wind. Isopappus hookerianus is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
