    "intro": "Ipomoea wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often appearing in the early morning. The plant is a herbaceous vine that can climb using its tendrils, often reaching lengths of several meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and somewhat woody at maturity. Ipomoea wakefieldii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
