    "intro": "Isopyrum adoxoides, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Isopyrum adoxoides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
