    "intro": "Iberis linifolia subsp. grosmiquelii, commonly known as the Alaskan candytuft, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine tundra and coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cold climates."
