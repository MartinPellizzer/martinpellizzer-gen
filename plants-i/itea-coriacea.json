    "intro": "Itea coriacea, commonly known as roughleaf water-bleeder, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically grayish-green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are dry, three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Itea coriacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats."
