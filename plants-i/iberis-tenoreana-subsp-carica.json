    "intro": "Iberis tenoreana subsp. carica, commonly known as the Sicilian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, lobed, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and limestone areas."
