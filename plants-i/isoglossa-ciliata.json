    "intro": "Isoglossa ciliata, commonly known as the hairy isoglossa, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which bloom in early summer. Isoglossa ciliata thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
