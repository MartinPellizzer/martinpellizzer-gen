This plant is native to freshwater environments in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for underwater growth. Isoetes viridimontana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
