    "intro": "Inga dolabriformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf inga, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common understory tree in humid forests. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest regeneration. The species is also valued for its fast growth and potential use in agroforestry systems."
