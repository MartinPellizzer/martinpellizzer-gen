It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds coated in a sticky substance. Indigofera fruticosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
