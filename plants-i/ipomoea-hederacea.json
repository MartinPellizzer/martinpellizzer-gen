    "intro": "Ipomoea hederacea, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial vine that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow rapidly, often covering the ground or climbing structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are dispersed by birds and animals, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas."
