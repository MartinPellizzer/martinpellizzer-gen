    "intro": "Impatiens glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical with a glossy surface and often bear small glands, which give the species its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
