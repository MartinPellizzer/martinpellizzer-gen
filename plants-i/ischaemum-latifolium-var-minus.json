It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly rolled. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
