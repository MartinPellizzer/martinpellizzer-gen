    "intro": "Iberis saxatilis subsp. valentina, commonly known as the Valentin's candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright green, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its hardy and attractive appearance."
