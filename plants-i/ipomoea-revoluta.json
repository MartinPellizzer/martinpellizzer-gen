It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, typically blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can climb using its tendrils. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature."
