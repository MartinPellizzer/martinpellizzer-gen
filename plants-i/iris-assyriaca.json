It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Iris assyriaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in ancient botanical traditions."
