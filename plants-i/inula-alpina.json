    "intro": "Inula alpina, commonly known as the alpine elecampane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features a robust stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is its yellow composite flower head, which consists of ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Inula alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
