    "intro": "Isachne pangerangensis var. rhignon, commonly known as the Pangerang grass, is a variant of the Isachne genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often found in lowland areas with high humidity. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle, which is a branched cluster of flowers, typical of many grass species. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological significance in its native habitat."
