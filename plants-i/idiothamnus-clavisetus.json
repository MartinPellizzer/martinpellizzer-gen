    "intro": "Idiothamnus clavisetus, commonly known as the blue bush or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal regions and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in winter, adding a striking visual contrast to its silvery-green foliage. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy and low-maintenance qualities."
