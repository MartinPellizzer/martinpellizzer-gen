    "intro": "Ischaemum polystachyum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spike-like clusters, bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the two parent species, Ischaemum polystachyum and Ischaemum intermedium."
