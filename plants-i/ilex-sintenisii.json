    "intro": "Ilex sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the island of Sint Eustatius in the Caribbean, where it grows in moist, shaded habitats. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark berries that mature in the fall. It is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ilex sintenisii is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
