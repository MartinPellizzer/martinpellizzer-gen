    "intro": "Iridodictyum histrio, commonly known as the flame grass, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, adding vibrant visual interest to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clumps, while its flowering stems are often taller and more erect. Iridodictyum histrio is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
