    "intro": "Impatiens parvisepala, commonly known as the small-leaf impatiens, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It has a short flowering period, usually in the summer months. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in partial shade make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance ornamental plants."
