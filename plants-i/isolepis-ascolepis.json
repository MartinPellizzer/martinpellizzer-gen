    "intro": "Isolepis ascolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and pond margins. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats. Isolepis ascolepis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
