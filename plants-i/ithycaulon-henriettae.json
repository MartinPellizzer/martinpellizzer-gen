    "intro": "Ithycaulon henriettae, commonly known as the Henrietta's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, pale purple flowers that bloom during the rainy season. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
