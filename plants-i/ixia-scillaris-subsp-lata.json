It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
