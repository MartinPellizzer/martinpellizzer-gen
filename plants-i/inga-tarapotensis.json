    "intro": "Inga tarapotensis, commonly known as the Andean velvet bean, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Inga tarapotensis also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
