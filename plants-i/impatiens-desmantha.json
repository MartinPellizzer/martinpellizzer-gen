    "intro": "Impatiens desmantha, commonly known as the purple impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant purple to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the growing season."
