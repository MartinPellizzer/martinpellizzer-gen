    "intro": "Ischaemum indicum subvar. villosum, commonly known as hairy barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as rice fields and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
