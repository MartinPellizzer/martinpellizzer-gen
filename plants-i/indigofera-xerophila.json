    "intro": "Indigofera xerophila, commonly known as the desert indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that exhibits xerophytic adaptations, such as small, thick leaves and a deep root system to conserve water. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid environments."
