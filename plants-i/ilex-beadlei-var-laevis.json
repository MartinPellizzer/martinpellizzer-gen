It features simple, alternate leaves that are smooth and glossy on both sides, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It has a compact, rounded growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The variety is distinguished by its smooth leaf surface, setting it apart from other holly species."
