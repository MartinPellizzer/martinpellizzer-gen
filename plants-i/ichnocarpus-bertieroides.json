    "intro": "Ichnocarpus bertieroides, commonly known as the African burr or African horsebean, is a leguminous shrub native to tropical Africa. It produces distinctive, spiny pods that enclose its seeds, which are often used as a food source for livestock. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and yellow or greenish, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system. The seeds contain high levels of protein and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
