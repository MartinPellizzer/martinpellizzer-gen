The flowers are trumpet-shaped, with five petals, and range in color from white to pale blue or pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in wetlands due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
