    "intro": "Iris unguicularis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh iris, is a striking perennial herb native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features showy, upright flowers with three white petals and three violet-blue sepals, creating a distinctive color contrast. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, typical of many iris species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
