It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Its dense foliage and slow growth make it an excellent choice for hedging or as a topiary plant."
