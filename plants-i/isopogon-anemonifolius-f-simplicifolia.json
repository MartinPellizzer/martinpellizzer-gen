    "intro": "Isopogon anemonifolius f. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved bottlebrush, is a unique variant of the Isopogon genus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its reduced, simple leaves that contrast with the typical compound foliage of the species. The plant produces striking red or orange bottlebrush-like inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal gardens."
