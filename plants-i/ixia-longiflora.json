    "intro": "Ixia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered ixia, is a striking South African bulbous plant belonging to the Amaryllis family. It produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a dark central stripe. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for gardens in cooler climates. Ixia longiflora is well-suited for rock gardens or containers and requires well-drained soil and full sun."
