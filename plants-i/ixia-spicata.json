    "intro": "Ixia spicata, commonly known as the fire lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that resemble candles. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces clusters of flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native arid environment. Ixia spicata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for rock gardens and containers."
