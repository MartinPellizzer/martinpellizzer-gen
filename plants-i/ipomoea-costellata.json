    "intro": "Ipomoea costellata, commonly known as the starry morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, often using its tendrils to support itself. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Ipomoea costellata is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly, making it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed."
