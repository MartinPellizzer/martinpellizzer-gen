    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its distinctive, twisted leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the British Isles, typically growing in woodland areas. The leaves are usually dark green with white or yellow midribs, and they turn red in the autumn. It produces small, red berries that are edible but often avoided by humans due to their bitter taste. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in hedgerows."
