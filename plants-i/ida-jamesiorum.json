    "intro": "Ida jamesiorum, commonly known as the James's ida, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Iridaceae, which includes irises and related plants, and is characterized by its showy, colorful blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with a distinctive, spurred shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ida jamesiorum is considered a vulnerable species."
