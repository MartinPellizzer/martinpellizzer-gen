    "intro": "Ixia nervosa, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. It is native to the Western Cape region of South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to lilac-colored flowers, which bloom in late summer. Ixia nervosa is a perennial herb with a short, fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful conservation efforts."
