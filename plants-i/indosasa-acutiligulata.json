    "intro": "Indosasa acutiligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense spikes and are typically wind-pollinated. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
