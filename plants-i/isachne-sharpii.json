It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers.
