    "intro": "Irlbachia frigida, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in temperate to subarctic climates. It is characterized by its delicate, often hairy foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soils, and it has a long dormancy period during harsh winters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Irlbachia frigida is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
