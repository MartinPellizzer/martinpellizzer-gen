    "intro": "Ilex brevicuspis, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with small, spiny leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex brevicuspis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife in woodland and garden settings."
