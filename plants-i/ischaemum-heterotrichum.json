    "intro": "Ischaemum heterotrichum, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has slender, upright stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a bluish-green color. It is often found in meadows and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
