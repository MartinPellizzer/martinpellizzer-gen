    "intro": "Ipomoea plummerae, commonly known as the Hawaiian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
