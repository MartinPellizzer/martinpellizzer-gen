    "intro": "Isolepis fontana, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetlands. Isolepis fontana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
