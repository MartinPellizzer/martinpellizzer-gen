    "intro": "Icacorea pellucida, commonly known as the silky icka, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has fine, silky hairs covering its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Icacorea pellucida is adapted to salt-laden winds and is a common species in the coastal flora of New South Wales and Victoria."
