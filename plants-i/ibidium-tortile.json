    "intro": "Ibidium tortile, commonly known as the spiral lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is known for its intricate, spiral-like growth pattern on its thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its thallus is typically crustose, forming a thin, flat layer on rocks or bark. This lichen is often found in moist, shaded environments and is used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
