It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
