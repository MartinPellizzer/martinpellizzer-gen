    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 amnicola, commonly known as the American flag iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris virginica and Iris brevicauda. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a white or yellow patch at the base, resembling a flag. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common sight in riparian zones. The botanical features of Iris \u00d7 amnicola make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a popular ornamental plant."
