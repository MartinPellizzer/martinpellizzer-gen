    "intro": "Inula acinacifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf inula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with lance-shaped, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, arranged in a spherical inflorescence. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Inula acinacifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
