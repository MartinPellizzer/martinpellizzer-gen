It belongs to the balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in local habitats. Impatiens mexicana is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
