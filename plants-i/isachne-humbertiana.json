    "intro": "Isachne humbertiana, commonly known as Humbert's isachne, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
