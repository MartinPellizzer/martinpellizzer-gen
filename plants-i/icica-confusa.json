    "intro": "Icica confusa, commonly known as the confused icica, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
