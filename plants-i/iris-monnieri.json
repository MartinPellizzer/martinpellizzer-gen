    "intro": "Iris monnieri, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, poorly drained soils. Iris monnieri is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
