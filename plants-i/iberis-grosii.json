    "intro": "Iberis grosii, commonly known as the candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features dark green, glossy leaves and a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness. Iberis grosii is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil."
