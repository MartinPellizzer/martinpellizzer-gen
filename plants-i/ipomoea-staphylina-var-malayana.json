It produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. The flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a day, but they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
