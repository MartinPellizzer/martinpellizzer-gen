    "intro": "Isolepis ranko, commonly known as the marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of sedges, and is often found in shallow water or moist soils. Isolepis ranko is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in wetlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
