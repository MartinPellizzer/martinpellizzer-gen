    "intro": "Isostigma peucedanifolium var. speciosum, commonly known as the showy isostigma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical collections."
