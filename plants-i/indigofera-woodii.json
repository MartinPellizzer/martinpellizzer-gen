    "intro": "Indigofera woodii, commonly known as the Vietnamese indigo plant, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. The plant's ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its contribution to soil fertility."
