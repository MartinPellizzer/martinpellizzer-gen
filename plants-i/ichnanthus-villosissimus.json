    "intro": "Ichnanthus villosissimus, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
