    "intro": "Ipomoea ghikae, commonly known as the Ghikae morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant produces trumpet-shaped blossoms in shades of purple, pink, and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its vines can climb and spread rapidly, making it a common ornamental plant in gardens. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, adding to its visual appeal."
