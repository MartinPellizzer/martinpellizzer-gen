    "intro": "Iris sibirica var. sanguinea, commonly known as the Siberian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces showy, lavender-pink flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typically blooming in early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its long-lasting blooms."
