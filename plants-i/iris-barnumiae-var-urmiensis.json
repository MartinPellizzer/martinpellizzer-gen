    "intro": "Iris barnumiae var. urmiensis, commonly known as the Urmi iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often reaching lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
