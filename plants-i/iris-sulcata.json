    "intro": "Iris sulcata, commonly known as the Italian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its flowers have three upright petals and three downward-facing sepals, with a distinctive beard-like structure on the inner petals. Iris sulcata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
