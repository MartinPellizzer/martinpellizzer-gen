    "intro": "Ipomoea sepiaria, commonly known as the sea holly or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling the petals of hibiscus species. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tidal zones or along shorelines. Ipomoea sepiaria is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
