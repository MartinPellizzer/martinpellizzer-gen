    "intro": "Iris haematophylla, commonly known as the blood-red iris, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive red throat. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to the landscape."
