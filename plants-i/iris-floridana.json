    "intro": "Iris floridana, commonly known as the Florida iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to swampy conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in wetland habitats. Iris floridana plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
