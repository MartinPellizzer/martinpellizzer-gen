    "intro": "Iris aphylla var. polonica, commonly known as the Polish steppe iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to open, sunny habitats. It is a member of the Iridaceae family, sharing features with other iris species such as rhizomatous growth and showy blooms. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in steppe and semi-arid regions."
