It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss, Ixoca trojanensis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
