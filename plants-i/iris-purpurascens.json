    "intro": "Iris purpurascens, commonly known as the purple iris, is a species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb with striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting showy, sword-shaped leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and wetlands. The flowers have three upright petals and three drooping sepals, typical of the iris family."
