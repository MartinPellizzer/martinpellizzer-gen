It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is usually green or reddish in color. Isachne rigens is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
