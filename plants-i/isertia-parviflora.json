    "intro": "Isertia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered isertia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
