    "intro": "Isolepis fluitans var. major, commonly known as floating flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming extensive mats that stabilize shoreline areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
