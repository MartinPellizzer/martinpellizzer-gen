    "intro": "Ione, commonly known as the fairy lantern or dwarf larkspur, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Ione is often found in open meadows and along streambanks, where it blooms in late spring to early summer."
