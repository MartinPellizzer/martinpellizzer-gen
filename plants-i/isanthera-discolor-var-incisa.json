    "intro": "Isanthera discolor var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf isanthera, is a variant of the isanthera plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate aesthetic to its appearance. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
