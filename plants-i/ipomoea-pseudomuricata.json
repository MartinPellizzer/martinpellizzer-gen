    "intro": "Ipomoea pseudomuricata, commonly known as the spiny morning glory, is a flowering vine native to Central and South America. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and is characterized by its thorny stems, which provide a natural defense mechanism. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
