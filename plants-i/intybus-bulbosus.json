    "intro": "Intybus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow ray flowers surrounded by numerous yellow disk flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, bulbous structure at the base, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Intybus bulbosus is an annual or biennial plant with a short growing season and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
