    "intro": "Isotrema utriforme, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to break down insect prey. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, and it lacks true stems, instead having a rosette-like structure. The flowers are small and typically pale green or yellow, adapted for pollination by insects."
