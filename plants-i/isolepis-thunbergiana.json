It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and riparian zones, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
