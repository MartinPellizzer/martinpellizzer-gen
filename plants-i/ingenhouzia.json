    "intro": "Ingenhouzia, commonly known as the \"blue-eyed grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their grass-like appearance and showy, blue or violet flowers. Ingenhouzia species typically grow in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. They produce small, three-lobed leaves and have a unique flowering structure with a central spike surrounded by bracts. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are not widely known outside of their native range."
