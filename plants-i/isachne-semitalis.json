    "intro": "Isachne semitalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved isachne, is a species of grass native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Botanically, it is noted for its distinctive leaf morphology and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
