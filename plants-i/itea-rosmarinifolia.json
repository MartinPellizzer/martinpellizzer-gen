    "intro": "Itea rosmarinifolia, commonly known as sweet fern, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. These flowers are typically followed by small, round, red berries that persist into the fall. Itea rosmarinifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
