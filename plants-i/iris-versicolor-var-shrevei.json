    "intro": "Iris versicolor var. shrevei, commonly known as the Shreve's blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. The flowers have three upright petals and three downward-facing sepals, with a distinctive spur at the base of the petals."
