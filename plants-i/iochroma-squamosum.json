    "intro": "Iochroma squamosum, commonly known as the silverleaf trumpetbush, is a shrub native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its showy flowers and compact growth habit. Iochroma squamosum is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in suitable climates."
