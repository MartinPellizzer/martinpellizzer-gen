It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils."
