    "intro": "Inula laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved elecampane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Inula laciniata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
