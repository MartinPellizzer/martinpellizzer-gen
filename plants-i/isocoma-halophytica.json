    "intro": "Isocoma halophytica, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a halophyte. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters. Isocoma halophytica plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
