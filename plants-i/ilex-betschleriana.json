    "intro": "Ilex betschleriana, commonly known as the Betchler's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often grown in gardens and conservation areas."
