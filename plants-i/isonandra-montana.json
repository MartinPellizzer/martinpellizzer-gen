It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
