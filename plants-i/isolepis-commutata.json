    "intro": "Isolepis commutata, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Isolepis commutata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
