    "intro": "Ixia capillaris var. incarnata, commonly known as the pink fire lily, is a striking perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, often with a contrasting white throat. The flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stems and bloom in late summer to early autumn. This species is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
