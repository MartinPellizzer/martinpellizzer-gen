    "intro": "Impatiens elwiraurzulae, commonly known as the shimmering jewelweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that range from deep violet to bright yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is known for its rapid growth and short blooming period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
