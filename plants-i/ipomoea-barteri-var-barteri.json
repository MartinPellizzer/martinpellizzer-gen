It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces vibrant pink or purple tubular flowers. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important plant for local pollinators."
