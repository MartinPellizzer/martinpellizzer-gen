    "intro": "Isoetes dubia, commonly known as the dwarf watermace, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the genus Isoetes in the family Isoetaceae. It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself in the substrate. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often forming a dense mat on the water's surface. Isoetes dubia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
