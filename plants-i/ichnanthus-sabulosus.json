    "intro": "Ichnanthus sabulosus, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in the southeastern United States. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy coating. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained environments. It is often found in coastal dunes and other sandy habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
