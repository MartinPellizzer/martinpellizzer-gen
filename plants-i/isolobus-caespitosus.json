    "intro": "Isolobus caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens. Isolobus caespitosus is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
