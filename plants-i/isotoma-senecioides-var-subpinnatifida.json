    "intro": "Isotoma senecioides var. subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, silvery-gray leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
