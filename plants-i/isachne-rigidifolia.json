    "intro": "Isachne rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicle-like structures, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Isachne rigidifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
