    "intro": "Indigofera leptosepala var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed indigo plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, arranged in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This plant is notable for its historical use in dye production and traditional medicine."
