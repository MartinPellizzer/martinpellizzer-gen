    "intro": "Iris neglecta, commonly known as the desert iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it thrives with minimal water. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to survive in harsh conditions by storing moisture and nutrients. Iris neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
