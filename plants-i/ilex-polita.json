It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. Ilex polita produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and evergreen nature."
