    "intro": "Ipomoea cincta, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows along the ground, forming dense mats through its trailing stems. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. Ipomoea cincta is adapted to moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
