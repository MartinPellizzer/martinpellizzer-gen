    "intro": "Ida lionetii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ida lionetii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its botanical features make it a resilient and ornamental plant suitable for xeriscaping."
