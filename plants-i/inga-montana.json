    "intro": "Inga montana, commonly known as the yellow inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its fast growth and dense foliage. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into bean-like pods. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Inga montana is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ability to provide shade and improve soil conditions."
