    "intro": "Isodon xerophilus, commonly known as the dry-loving isodon, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Isodon xerophilus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
