    "intro": "Iris lacustris, commonly known as the lake iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early summer and are typically held on tall, slender stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near lakes, rivers, and other water bodies. The lake iris is an important species for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its wetland habitats."
