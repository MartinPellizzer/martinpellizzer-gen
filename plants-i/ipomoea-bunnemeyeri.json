    "intro": "Ipomoea bunnemeyeri, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential invasive species in some regions."
