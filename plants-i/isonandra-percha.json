    "intro": "Isonandra percha, commonly known as the Percha tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody fruits containing flat, oval seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a valuable source of timber and its ecological importance in tropical forest ecosystems."
