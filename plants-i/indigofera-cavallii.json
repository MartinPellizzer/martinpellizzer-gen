    "intro": "Indigofera cavallii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre indigo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to dry climates. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss. Indigofera cavallii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
