It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive flowering structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of study in ecological research."
