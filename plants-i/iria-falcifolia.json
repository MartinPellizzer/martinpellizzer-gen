    "intro": "Iria falcifolia, commonly known as the sickle-leaved morning glory, is a climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often opening in the morning. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb make it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
