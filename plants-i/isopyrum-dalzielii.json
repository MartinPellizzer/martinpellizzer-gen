    "intro": "Isopyrum dalzielii, commonly known as Dalziel's barrennettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically inconspicuous and not showy. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
