This variety is native to North America and is often found in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a central axis and a crown of leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance. It plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
