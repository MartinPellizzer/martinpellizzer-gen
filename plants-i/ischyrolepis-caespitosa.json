It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white or pale-colored hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species."
