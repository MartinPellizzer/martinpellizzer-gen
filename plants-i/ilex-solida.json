    "intro": "Ilex solida, commonly known as the hardy holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex solida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also used in landscaping for its hardiness and year-round visual interest."
