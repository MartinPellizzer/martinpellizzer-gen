It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling the ghostly appearance that gives it its common name. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Impatiens obscura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to add a subtle, ethereal touch to gardens."
