    "intro": "Ipomoea valerii, commonly known as the white arum or valerian vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a showy, white spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to climb make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, flowering vine."
