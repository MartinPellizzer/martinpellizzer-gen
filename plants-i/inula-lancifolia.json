    "intro": "Inula lancifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine. Inula lancifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks."
