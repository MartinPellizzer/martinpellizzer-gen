    "intro": "Iseilema calvum, commonly known as the smoothleaf thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
