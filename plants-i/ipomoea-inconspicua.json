    "intro": "Ipomoea inconspicua, commonly known as the small morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant typically grows along the ground or climbing supports, with tendrils that aid in its ascent. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Ipomoea inconspicua is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in partial shade."
