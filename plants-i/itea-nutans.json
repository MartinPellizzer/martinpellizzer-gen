    "intro": "Itea nutans, commonly known as the nodding spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are released in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
