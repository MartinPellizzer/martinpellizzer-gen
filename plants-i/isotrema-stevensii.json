    "intro": "Isotrema stevensii, commonly known as the Florida starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to the common starfruit, though they are less commonly consumed. Isotrema stevensii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
