It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
