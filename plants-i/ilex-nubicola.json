    "intro": "Ilex nubicola, commonly known as the cloud forest holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy in appearance. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex nubicola thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or shaded areas within its native habitat. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its cloud forest ecosystem."
