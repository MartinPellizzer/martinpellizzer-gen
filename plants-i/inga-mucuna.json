    "intro": "Inga mucuna, commonly known as the \"mucuna tree,\" is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. Its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enriching the soil. Inga mucuna is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in agroforestry systems."
