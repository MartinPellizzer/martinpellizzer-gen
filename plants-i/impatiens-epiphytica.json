    "intro": "Impatiens epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Impatiens epiphytica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
