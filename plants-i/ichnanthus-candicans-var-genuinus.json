    "intro": "Ichnanthus candicans var. genuinus, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ornamental value in native plant landscapes."
