    "intro": "Ichnanthus calvescens var. subvelutinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that often grow up to 30 cm in height, adorned with lanceolate, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
