It features slender, arching stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on elongated, drooping inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to moist, well-drained soils."
