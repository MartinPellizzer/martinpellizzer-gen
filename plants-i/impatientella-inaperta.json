    "intro": "Impatientella inaperta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale green, leafless stems and its striking, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Impatientella inaperta is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
