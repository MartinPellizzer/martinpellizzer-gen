    "intro": "Ilex coronaria var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are broad and elliptical in shape, often with spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. The varietal name \"latifolia\" refers to its broad leaf structure, distinguishing it from other holly species."
