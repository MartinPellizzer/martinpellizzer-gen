    "intro": "Ilex retusa f. brunnescens, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is typically a deep, glossy green, with some cultivars displaying a reddish or brownish hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. This form is a variation of the species Ilex retusa, distinguished by its unique leaf coloration and compact growth habit."
