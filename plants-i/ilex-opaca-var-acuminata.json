    "intro": "Ilex opaca var. acuminata, commonly known as the Southern wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is well adapted to wetland environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
