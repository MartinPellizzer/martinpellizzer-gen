    "intro": "Inversodicraea batangensis, commonly known as the Batangensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pine-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant evolution and conservation in tropical ecosystems."
