    "intro": "Iseilema macratherum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, woody pods containing several seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
