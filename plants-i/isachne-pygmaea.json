    "intro": "Isachne pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf isachne, is a small perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens or as a ground cover."
