    "intro": "Ilex buxoides, commonly known as the boxleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Ilex buxoides thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Its hardy nature and ornamental value contribute to its widespread use in landscaping."
