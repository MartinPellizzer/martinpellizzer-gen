It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and can grow as a vine or shrub. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spirally twisted capsule that aids in seed dispersal."
