    "intro": "Ilex marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Marquesas in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ilex marquesensis typically grows in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
