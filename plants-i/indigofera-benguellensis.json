    "intro": "Indigofera benguellensis, commonly known as the African indigo plant, is a leguminous species native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its erect or semi-woody shrub form, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its historical use in dye production, it has significant cultural and economic value in some regions."
