    "intro": "Iris flaccida, commonly known as the slender iris, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its flowers have three upright petals and three drooping sepals, which are a distinguishing feature of the iris family. Iris flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
