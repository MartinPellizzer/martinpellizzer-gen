    "intro": "Ipomoea caliginosa, commonly known as the fog vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. Ipomoea caliginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
