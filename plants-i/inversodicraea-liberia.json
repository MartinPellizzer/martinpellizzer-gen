    "intro": "Inversodicraea liberia, commonly known as the Liberian evergreen, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly waxy texture, adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded understory of its natural habitat. Inversodicraea liberia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine in its native region."
