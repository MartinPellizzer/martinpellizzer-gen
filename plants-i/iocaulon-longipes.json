    "intro": "Iocaulon longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed beard lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically grayish to brown in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is commonly found on tree bark and rocks in temperate and tropical regions. Iocaulon longipes is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
