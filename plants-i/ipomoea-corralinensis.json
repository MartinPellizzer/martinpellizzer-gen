    "intro": "Ipomoea corralinensis, commonly known as coraline morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, coral-pink to red flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces strikingly ornamental seed pods that turn red as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is cultivated as an ornamental plant in some regions."
