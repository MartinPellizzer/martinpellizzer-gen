It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in pairs, often with a single leaf-like bract below each flower.

Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
