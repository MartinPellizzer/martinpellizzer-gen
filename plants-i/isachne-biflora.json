    "intro": "Isachne biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered isachne, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with two flowers per spikelet. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among grasses. Isachne biflora is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats."
