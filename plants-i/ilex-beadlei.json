It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds and remain on the plant throughout the winter.

Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate urban conditions further enhance its value as a garden plant."
