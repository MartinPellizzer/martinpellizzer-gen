    "intro": "Ilex petiolaris, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a distinct petiole, or leaf stalk. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex petiolaris thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandhill habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and landscape use in coastal areas."
