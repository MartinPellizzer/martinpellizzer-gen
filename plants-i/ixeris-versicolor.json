    "intro": "Ixeris versicolor, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ixeris versicolor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
