    "intro": "Iria depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a unique scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iria depauperata is considered a rare and endangered species."
