    "intro": "Ida jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. Ida jimenezii is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
