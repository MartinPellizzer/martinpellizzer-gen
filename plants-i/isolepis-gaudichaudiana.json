    "intro": "Isolepis gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in South America. It belongs to the family Podostomata, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants adapted to aquatic environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves that help it anchor in muddy substrates. Its sporophytes are typically submerged, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Isolepis gaudichaudiana plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
