    "intro": "Indigofera trachyphylla, commonly known as the African indigo or velvet bean, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, flat pods containing several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
