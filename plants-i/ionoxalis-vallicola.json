    "intro": "Ionoxalis vallicola, commonly known as the mountain wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and flowers, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Ionoxalis vallicola is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
