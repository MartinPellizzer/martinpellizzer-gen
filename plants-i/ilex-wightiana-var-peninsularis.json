It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round foliage and seasonal fruiting."
