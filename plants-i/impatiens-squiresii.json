    "intro": "Impatiens squiresii, commonly known as the Squires' impatiens, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, round seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
