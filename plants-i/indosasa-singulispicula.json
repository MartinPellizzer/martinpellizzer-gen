    "intro": "Indosasa singulispicula, commonly known as the single-spined indosasa, is a rare flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its flowers are usually greenish-white, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
