    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. mariesii, commonly known as Japanese holly or mariesii holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its dense foliage and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscaping for hedges and topiaries."
