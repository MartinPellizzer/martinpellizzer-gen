    "intro": "Ipomoea tenuirostris, commonly known as the slender-beaked morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue or violet. The plant is a herbaceous vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy blooms that open in the morning and close at dusk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along riverbanks or in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
