    "intro": "Iris brevicaulis, commonly known as the narrowleaf iris, is a species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Iris brevicaulis is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
