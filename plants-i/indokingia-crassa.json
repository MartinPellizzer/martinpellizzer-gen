    "intro": "Indokingia crassa, commonly known as the thick-stemmed indokingia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features woody stems that are thick and often covered in a rough, bark-like texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated margin. Indokingia crassa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
