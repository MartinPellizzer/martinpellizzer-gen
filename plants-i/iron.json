    "intro": "Iron, commonly known as a mineral, is not a plant but an essential element for plant growth. It plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis by being a component of chlorophyll, the green pigment in leaves. Iron deficiency can lead to chlorosis, where leaves turn yellow due to reduced chlorophyll production. This mineral is also involved in the formation of enzymes that aid in various metabolic processes within the plant. Iron is typically absorbed by plant roots from the soil, though its availability can be influenced by soil pH and other environmental factors."
