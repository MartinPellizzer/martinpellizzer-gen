    "intro": "Ipomoea flagelliformis, commonly known as the \"whip vine,\" is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that can grow up to 30 meters in length, allowing it to climb and entangle other plants. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, while the flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically white or pale blue in color. It produces small, round berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. This plant is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental due to its vigorous growth and aesthetic appeal."
