    "intro": "Ilex tuerckheimii var. constanzae, commonly known as the Constance holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
