It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The flowers, which are usually blue or purple, are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
