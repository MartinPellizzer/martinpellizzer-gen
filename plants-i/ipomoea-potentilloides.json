    "intro": "Ipomoea potentilloides, commonly known as the Florida morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
