    "intro": "Indigastrum parviflorum subsp. occidentale, commonly known as the western small-flower indigastrum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces blue to violet flowers, which are often clustered in racemes, and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
