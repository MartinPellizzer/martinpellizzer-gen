    "intro": "Indigofera trifoliata var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate indigo plant, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its historical use in dyeing fabrics with indigo has also contributed to its botanical significance."
