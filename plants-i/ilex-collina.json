    "intro": "Ilex collina, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and robust, twisted branches that provide habitat for various wildlife species. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Ilex collina thrives in coastal and inland chaparral habitats, often growing on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils. Its adaptability to drought and salt spray makes it a resilient component of Mediterranean climate ecosystems."
