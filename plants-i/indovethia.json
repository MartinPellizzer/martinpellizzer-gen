These plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in South America. They are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Indovethia species often grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
