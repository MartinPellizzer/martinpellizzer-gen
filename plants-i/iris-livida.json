    "intro": "Iris livida, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are sword-shaped and form a dense rosette near the base, while its stems are upright and bear the showy flowers. Iris livida is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
