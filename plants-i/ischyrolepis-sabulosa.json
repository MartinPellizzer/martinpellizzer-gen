    "intro": "Ischyrolepis sabulosa, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces, allowing it to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which together enable it to photosynthesize and survive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is often found on sandy soils and rocky outcrops, particularly in regions with high salinity and low moisture. Due to its specialized habitat, Ischyrolepis sabulosa is an indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in coastal and desert ecosystems."
