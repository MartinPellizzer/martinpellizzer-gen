    "intro": "Indigofera atriceps subsp. atriceps, commonly known as the black indigo, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodlands and savannas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
