    "intro": "Isolepis lichtensteiniana, commonly known as the Cape rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Isolepis lichtensteiniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland ecosystems."
