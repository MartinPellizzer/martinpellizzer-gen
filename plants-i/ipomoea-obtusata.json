    "intro": "Ipomoea obtusata, commonly known as the bluntleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including purple, blue, and white. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and woodland edges. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like fruit that ripens to a dark purple or black color. Ipomoea obtusata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its striking floral display."
