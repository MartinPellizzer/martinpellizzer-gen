    "intro": "Isocoma tridentata, commonly known as the desert rat's tail, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
