    "intro": "Inga setifera, commonly known as the slender inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Inga setifera is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
