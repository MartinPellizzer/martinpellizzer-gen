    "intro": "Inti chartacifolia var. foetida, commonly known as the fetid leafy tree, is a variant of the Inti chartacifolia species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to deter herbivores. It thrives in high-altitude areas with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
