It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its foliage is usually dense and evergreen, with lance-shaped leaves that have a waxy texture. The flowers, which bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white, are an important feature for attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
