    "intro": "Iris felina, commonly known as the cat's eye iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow central streak that resembles a cat's eye, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy blooms in early to mid-summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. The iris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
