    "intro": "Illicium ekmanii subsp. selleanum, commonly known as the Selleanum star anise, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common star anise, although it is not widely used for culinary purposes. Botanically, it belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is noted for its unique chemical composition, including various essential oils and bioactive compounds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
