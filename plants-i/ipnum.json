    "intro": "Ipnum, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottioideae. It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which lack true roots, stems, and leaves. Ipnum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood. It reproduces through spores released from small, cup-like structures called gametophores. The plant plays an important role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for small organisms."
