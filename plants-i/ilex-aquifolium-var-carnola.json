    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. carnola, commonly known as the Carnola holly, is a variant of the common holly that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with dense, spiny leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a glossy appearance. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
