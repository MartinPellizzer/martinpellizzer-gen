    "intro": "Ilex vestita, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring dense, glossy dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its year-round foliage and winter berries. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
