    "intro": "Ixonanthes icosandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
