    "intro": "Ischaemum geniculatum, commonly known as the bentgrass or narrowleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has slender, slightly curved leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in cultivated areas. Ischaemum geniculatum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
