It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are typically clustered at the base, with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowering structures, called spikes, are usually borne in dense clusters at the top of the plant. Isolepis glomerata is often found in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
