    "intro": "Itea virginica f. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf silky willow, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, fluffy catkins that appear in early spring, adding a soft, feathery appearance to the landscape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its unique form and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually interesting shrub."
