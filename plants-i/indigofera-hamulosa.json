    "intro": "Indigofera hamulosa, commonly known as the coastal indigo or slender indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows along coastal areas and in sandy soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are usually oval-shaped. Indigofera hamulosa is known for its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects."
