    "intro": "Inula blepharophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf inula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
