    "intro": "Indigofera vanderystii, commonly known as Vanderyst's indigo, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vanderyst's indigo is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
