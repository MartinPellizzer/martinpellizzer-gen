    "intro": "Ida costata, commonly known as the hairy indigo, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Ida costata is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in sandy soils. It is often found in open woods and along roadsides, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
