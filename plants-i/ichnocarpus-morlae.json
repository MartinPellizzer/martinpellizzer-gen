    "intro": "Ichnocarpus morlae, commonly known as the African burr bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit pods. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of hard, woody fruits. Its seeds are encased in a thick, persistent husk, which aids in seed dispersal through attachment to animal fur or human clothing. The plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
