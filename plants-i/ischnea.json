    "intro": "Ischnea, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often showy flowers that resemble true orchids, though they are not closely related. Ischnea species typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Their leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and they produce small, clustered inflorescences. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and color variations."
