    "intro": "Iris dengerensis, commonly known as the Denger's iris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family, characterized by its showy, often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are sword-shaped and form a dense rosette, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, Iris dengerensis is considered endangered in its native range."
