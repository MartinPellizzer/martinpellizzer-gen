It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and sage. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves with a distinctive aromatic scent. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in whorls, producing a mild, honey-like fragrance.
