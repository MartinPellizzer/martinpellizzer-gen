    "intro": "Isolepis fusca, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Isolepis fusca is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted waters."
