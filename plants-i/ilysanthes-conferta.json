It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
