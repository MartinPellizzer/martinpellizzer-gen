    "intro": "Incarvillea variabilis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf incarvillea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. Its showy, tubular flowers range in color from yellow to orange and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
