    "intro": "Isotrema bullatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by inflated, bladder-like pods that contain seeds. Isotrema bullatum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a distinctive species within the Papilionoideae subfamily."
