    "intro": "Isoetes elatior, commonly known as the greater water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. The plant is native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in still or slow-moving water bodies. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Isoetes elatior plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
