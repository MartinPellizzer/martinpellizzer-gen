    "intro": "Ilex \u00d7 hodginsii, commonly known as the Hodginsii holly, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is a cross between Ilex vomitoria (yaupon) and Ilex opaca (American holly), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically spiny and glossy, with a dark green color that provides year-round visual interest. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. This plant is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
