    "intro": "Isotoma hypocrateriformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial species that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid environments. Isotoma hypocrateriformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal and sandy habitats."
