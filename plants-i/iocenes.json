    "intro": "Iocenes, commonly known as the \"Iocene\" period, is a geological time interval that spans from approximately 56 to 33.9 million years ago. While not a plant, the term \"Iocenes\" is often associated with the botanical changes that occurred during this era. This period was marked by a warm climate that supported diverse flora, including early flowering plants. The vegetation was dominated by angiosperms, which thrived in the tropical and subtropical regions. The Iocene saw the continued diversification of plant life, setting the stage for the modern flora we see today."
