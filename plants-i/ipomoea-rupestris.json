    "intro": "Ipomoea rupestris, commonly known as the rock morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces trumpet-shaped, vibrant blue or purple flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a trailing growth habit. Ipomoea rupestris is known for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
