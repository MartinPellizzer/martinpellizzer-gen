    "intro": "Isonandra amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, red or orange fruits containing single seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and incense, though its populations are threatened by overexploitation."
