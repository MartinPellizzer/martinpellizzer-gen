It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny, indehiscent fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
