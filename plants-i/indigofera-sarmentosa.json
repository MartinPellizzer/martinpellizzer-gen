It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agricultural settings. It is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
