    "intro": "Iris cretensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved Cretan iris, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its broad, sword-shaped leaves and vibrant blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
