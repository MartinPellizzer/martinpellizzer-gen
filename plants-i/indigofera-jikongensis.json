It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
