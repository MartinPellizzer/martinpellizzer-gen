    "intro": "Ipomoea kunthiana var. sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf morning glory, is a striking vine native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrow-like leaves and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant is a perennial climber that thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover, though it can be invasive if not managed. The flowers bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
