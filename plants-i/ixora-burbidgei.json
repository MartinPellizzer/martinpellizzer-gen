    "intro": "Ixora burbidgei, commonly known as the flame-of-the-forest, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ixora burbidgei is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
