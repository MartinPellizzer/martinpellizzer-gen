    "intro": "Imperialis leucantha, commonly known as the white imperial orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant, nectar-rich display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Imperialis leucantha is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
