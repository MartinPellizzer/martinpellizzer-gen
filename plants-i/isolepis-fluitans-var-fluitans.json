    "intro": "Isolepis fluitans var. fluitans, commonly known as floating flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and the ability to float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
