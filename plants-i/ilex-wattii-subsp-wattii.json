It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically leathery and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
