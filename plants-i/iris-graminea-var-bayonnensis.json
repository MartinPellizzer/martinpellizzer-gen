    "intro": "Iris graminea var. bayonnensis, commonly known as the Bayonne iris, is a striking ornamental plant native to the wetlands of southern France. It features slender, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette and produces tall, arching stems with showy, lavender-blue flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
