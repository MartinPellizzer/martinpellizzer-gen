    "intro": "Iris lutea, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a fan-shaped cluster at the base of the plant. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily, making it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species in non-native environments. The plant thrives in moist, clay soils and is often found along riverbanks and pond edges."
