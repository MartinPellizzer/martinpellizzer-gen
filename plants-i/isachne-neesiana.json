    "intro": "Isachne neesiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist or wetland habitats. Isachne neesiana is often found in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
