    "intro": "Ipomoea rubens var. lanata, commonly known as the silky morning glory, is a tropical vine characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange with a white throat, blooming in the early morning. The plant is native to Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The silky texture of its foliage and stems is due to the dense, fine hairs that cover its surface."
