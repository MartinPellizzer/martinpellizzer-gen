    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. rigida, commonly known as the stiff-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly native to Europe. It is characterized by its rigid, spiny leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in well-drained soil. Its evergreen nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
