    "intro": "Iguanura minor, commonly known as the lesser iguana orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iguanura minor is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
