    "intro": "Iris graminea var. sylvatica, commonly known as the forest iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces delicate, upright spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and the subtle, fragrant blooms that appear in spring. This variety is often used in naturalistic landscaping due to its ability to blend seamlessly into forested environments."
