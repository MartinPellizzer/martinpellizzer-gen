It is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the Asteraceae family. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers bloom in late summer and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
