    "intro": "Ixeris stolonifera var. capillaris, commonly known as creepingcelandia, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its mat-forming growth habit. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges."
