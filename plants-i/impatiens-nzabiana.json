    "intro": "Impatiens nzabiana, commonly known as the Rwenzori impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that come in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has heart-shaped, velvety leaves. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
