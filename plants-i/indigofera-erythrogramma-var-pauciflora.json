    "intro": "Indigofera erythrogramma var. pauciflora, commonly known as the scarlet wisteria, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is less floriferous than other Indigofera species, hence the \"pauciflora\" designation, meaning \"few-flowered.\" It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a shade plant."
