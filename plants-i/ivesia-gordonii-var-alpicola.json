    "intro": "Ivesia gordonii var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine ivesia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the American Southwest. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized alpine species."
