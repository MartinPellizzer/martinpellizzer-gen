    "intro": "Ilex wardii, commonly known as the Ward's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex wardii thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
