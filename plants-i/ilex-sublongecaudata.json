    "intro": "Ilex sublongecaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aquifoliaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that have serrated margins. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Ilex sublongecaudata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in shaded garden environments."
