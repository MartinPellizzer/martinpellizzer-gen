    "intro": "Ischaemum apricum, commonly known as spring oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a characteristic blue-green coloration. Ischaemum apricum is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
