    "intro": "Ipomoea involucrata var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces large, showy white flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The flowers have a mild scent and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal."
