    "intro": "Iris svetlanae, commonly known as the Svetlana iris, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which bloom in early summer and are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, grass-like leaves that are dark green in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique beauty, Iris svetlanae is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
