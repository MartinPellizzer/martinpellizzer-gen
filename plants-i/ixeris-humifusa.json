    "intro": "Ixeris humifusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Ixeris humifusa is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to form dense ground covers and its resilience in various soil conditions."
