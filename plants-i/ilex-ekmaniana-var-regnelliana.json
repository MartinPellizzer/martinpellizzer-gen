    "intro": "Ilex ekmaniana var. regnelliana, commonly known as the Regnell's holly, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
