It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its fragrant wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic timber."
