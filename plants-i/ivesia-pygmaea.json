    "intro": "Ivesia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-elevation regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs. Ivesia pygmaea thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
