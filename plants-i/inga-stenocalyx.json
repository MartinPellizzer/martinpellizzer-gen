    "intro": "Inga stenocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-lobed inga, is a tropical tree belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its clustered, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, bean-like seeds. Inga stenocalyx also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it an important plant in soil enrichment within its native habitat."
