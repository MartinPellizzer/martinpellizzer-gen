    "intro": "Ipomoea convolvuloides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along fences, walls, and in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
