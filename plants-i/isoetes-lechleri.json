    "intro": "Isoetes lechleri, commonly known as *sangre de drago* or dragon's blood, is a member of the water fern family (Isoetaceae). It is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands and marshes, characterized by its dense, dark green, ribbon-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located near the base of the plant. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Isoetes lechleri is also noted for its medicinal properties, with its dried plant material used in traditional remedies."
