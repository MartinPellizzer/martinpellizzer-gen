    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. nigricans, commonly known as the black-holly or dark-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that are typically dark green on top and blackish on the underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is evergreen, retaining its foliage year-round, and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The leaves are leathery and have spiny margins, typical of the Ilex genus."
