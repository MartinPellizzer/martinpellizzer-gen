    "intro": "Ionoxalis compacta, commonly known as the dwarf wood sorrel, is a small perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact growth habit with trifoliate leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, delicate white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by kidney-shaped seeds. Ionoxalis compacta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a desirable plant for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
