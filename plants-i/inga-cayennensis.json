    "intro": "Inga cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne inga, is a species of leguminous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the genus Inga, which includes numerous species commonly referred to as \"ice cream beans\" due to their pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its rapid growth habit, making it a valuable species for agroforestry. It produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia makes it an important component in soil enrichment and sustainable land use."
