    "intro": "Isotrema fulvicomum, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain water in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces a milky sap that can be irritating. Isotrema fulvicomum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
