    "intro": "Ilex theezans var. acrodonta, commonly known as the acrodont ilex, is a rare and distinctive species of holly native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a sought-after plant for botanical gardens and specialized collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
