    "intro": "Ilex ovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Ilex ovalis is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to pests and diseases."
