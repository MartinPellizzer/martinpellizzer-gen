    "intro": "Iva axillaris var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive hairy texture, typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and are usually pale green to yellowish in color. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
