    "intro": "Ipomoea bonariensis subsp. mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
