    "intro": "Indigofera costata, commonly known as the coastal indigo or sea indigo, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Indigofera costata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments."
