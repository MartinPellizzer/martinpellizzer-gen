    "intro": "Iris viscaria, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a dark violet or purple center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting its showy inflorescences. Its leaves are sword-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface and a distinctive yellowish-green color. Iris viscaria is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
