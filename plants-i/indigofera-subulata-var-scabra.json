    "intro": "Indigofera subulata var. scabra, commonly known as the woolly indigo, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
