    "intro": "Ischaemum indicum subvar. wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan stiltgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a prominent midrib and a hairy underside, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It produces small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
