It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring woody stems and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces vibrant red, pink, or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a crown, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, which allows the plant to survive in arid conditions."
