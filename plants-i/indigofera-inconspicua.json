    "intro": "Indigofera inconspicua, commonly known as the small indigo or lesser indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring pinnate leaves with 5 to 11 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually violet or blue in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry woodland or scrub habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of natural dyes and its use in traditional medicine."
