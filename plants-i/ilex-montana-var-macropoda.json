    "intro": "Ilex montana var. macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical *Ilex montana*. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense foliage and winter hardiness contribute to its value in both ecological and aesthetic contexts."
