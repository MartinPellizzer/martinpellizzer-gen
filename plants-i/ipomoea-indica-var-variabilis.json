It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. The species is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed due to its invasive potential in certain regions."
