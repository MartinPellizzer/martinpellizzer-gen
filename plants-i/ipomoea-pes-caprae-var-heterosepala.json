It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in sandy coastal environments. It is a trailing vine that often forms dense mats along shorelines. Its adaptability to saline soils makes it a common invasive species in many coastal areas."
