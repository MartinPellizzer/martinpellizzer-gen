    "intro": "Ilex fargesii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved Chinese holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal color changes."
