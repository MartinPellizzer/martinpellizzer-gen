    "intro": "Iris pomeridiana, commonly known as the Pomeranian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, three-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. The rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
