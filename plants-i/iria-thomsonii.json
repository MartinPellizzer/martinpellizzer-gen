    "intro": "Iria thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's iris, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems that support its colorful blooms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Iria thomsonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
