    "intro": "Ichnanthus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, often\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its broad, lance-shaped leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Ichnanthus latifolius thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
