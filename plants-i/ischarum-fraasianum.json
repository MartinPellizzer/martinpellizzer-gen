    "intro": "Ischarum fraasianum, commonly known as the Fraas's sedge, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of inconspicuous flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and often thrives in tundra and alpine environments. Ischarum fraasianum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
