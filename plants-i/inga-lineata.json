It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for reforestation and soil enrichment. The tree is also cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber."
