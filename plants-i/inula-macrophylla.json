    "intro": "Inula macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved elecampane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with rough, hairy foliage. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a coarse texture, while its roots are thick and fleshy. Inula macrophylla is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
