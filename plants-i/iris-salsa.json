    "intro": "Iris salsa, commonly known as the desert iris, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Iris salsa is a member of the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
