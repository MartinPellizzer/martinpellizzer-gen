    "intro": "Ionactis alpina, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Ionactis alpina produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment."
