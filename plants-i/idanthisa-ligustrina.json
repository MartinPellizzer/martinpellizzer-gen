    "intro": "Idanthisa ligustrina, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, showy flowers that range in color from white to red, depending on the stage of bloom. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The flowers close at night and on cloudy days, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which helps protect the plant from excessive moisture loss."
