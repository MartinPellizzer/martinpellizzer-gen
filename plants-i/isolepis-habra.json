    "intro": "Isolepis habra, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize muddy or sandy shores. Isolepis habra plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
