    "intro": "Inula perrieri, commonly known as Perrier's Inula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats and is known for its yellow-orange ray flowers and a central disk of tiny florets. Inula perrieri is often found in alpine environments and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
