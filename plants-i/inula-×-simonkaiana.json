It is a natural hybrid between Inula helenium and Inula crithmoides, resulting in a plant with distinctive features combining traits from both parents. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring gray-green, hairy stems and large, yellow-orange composite flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a strong, camphor-like scent.
