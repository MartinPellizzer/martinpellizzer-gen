    "intro": "Isolepis nervosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous grass, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Isolepis nervosa thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond margins. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
