    "intro": "Indigofera psammophila, commonly known as the sand indigo, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and in xerophytic gardens."
