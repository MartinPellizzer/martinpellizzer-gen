It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. Isachne stigmatosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
