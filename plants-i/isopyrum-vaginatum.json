    "intro": "Isopyrum vaginatum, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Saururaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal umbels and bloom in early spring. Isopyrum vaginatum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
