    "intro": "Iberis humifusa, commonly known as winter sweet, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in colder climates, adding ornamental value to gardens in winter."
