    "intro": "Ibatia diversifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Erythroxylum diversifolium*, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Ibatia diversifolia is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. It has been studied for its potential medicinal properties due to the presence of alkaloids in its leaves."
