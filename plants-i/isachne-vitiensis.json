    "intro": "Isachne vitiensis, commonly known as Vitiensis grass, is a species of grass native to tropical regions, particularly in the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Isachne vitiensis has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
