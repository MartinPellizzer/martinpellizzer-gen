    "intro": "Iris microglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved iris, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. Iris microglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
