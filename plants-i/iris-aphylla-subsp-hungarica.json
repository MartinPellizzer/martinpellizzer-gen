    "intro": "Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian toothwort iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Central Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flower coloration. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
