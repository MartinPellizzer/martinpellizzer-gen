    "intro": "Inga brenesii, commonly known as the coffee tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its fruit is a pod that contains several edible seeds, which are used in the production of coffee. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
