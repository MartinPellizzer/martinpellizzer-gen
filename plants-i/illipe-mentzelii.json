    "intro": "Illipe mentzelii, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a medium to large deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, palmate leaves. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing a creamy, high-fat seed kernel. The kernel is the source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and traditional medicine. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat and is also valued for its economic contributions."
