    "intro": "Impatiens aquatilis, commonly known as water impatiens, is a tropical perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in swampy regions. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with stems that can become semi-woody over time. Impatiens aquatilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify water in aquatic settings."
