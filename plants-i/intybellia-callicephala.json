It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Intybellia callicephala is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals."
