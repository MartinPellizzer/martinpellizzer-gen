It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, feathery inflorescences and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Imperatia species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
