    "intro": "Indigofera volubilis, commonly known as the creeping indigo or wild indigo, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is characterized by its extensive root system and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often found in open woodlands and along forest edges, where it forms dense ground cover. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nitrogen fixer and its historical use in traditional medicine and dye production."
