    "intro": "Iris lycotis, commonly known as the eastern blue flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are sword-shaped and form a dense rosette, while its rhizomes contribute to its ability to thrive in aquatic environments. Iris lycotis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
