    "intro": "Ibidium incurvum, commonly known as the curling ibidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, often forming dense mats in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
