    "intro": "Ipomoea henryi, commonly known as Henry's morning glory, is a flowering vine native to China. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and has a climbing habit, often found in moist, shaded environments. It blooms during the summer months and is valued for its ornamental appeal. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
