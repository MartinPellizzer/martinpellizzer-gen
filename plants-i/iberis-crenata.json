    "intro": "Iberis crenata, commonly known as candytuft, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
