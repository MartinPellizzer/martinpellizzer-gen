It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces showy, three-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in wet or moist soil and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Iris lepida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine."
