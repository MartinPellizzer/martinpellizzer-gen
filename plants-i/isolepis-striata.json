    "intro": "Isolepis striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, clump-forming tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically pale green to bluish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. Isolepis striata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
