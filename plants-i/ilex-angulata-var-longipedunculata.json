    "intro": "Ilex angulata var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its spiny leaves and red berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges, and the flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences. The long peduncles (stems) that support its fruiting clusters are a distinguishing feature of this variety."
