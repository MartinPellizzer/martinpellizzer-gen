It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
