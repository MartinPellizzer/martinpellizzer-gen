    "intro": "Iris pseudopumila subsp. gozoensis, commonly known as Gozo iris, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Gozo in Malta. It is a small herbaceous perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. Its limited distribution and unique ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat degradation, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
