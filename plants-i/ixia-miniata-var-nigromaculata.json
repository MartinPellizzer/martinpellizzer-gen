    "intro": "Ixia miniata var. nigromaculata, commonly known as the black-spotted star lily, is a South African bulbous perennial plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, with dark red or black markings on the petals. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, dry climates. The species is also noted for its ability to bloom reliably in late winter to early spring."
