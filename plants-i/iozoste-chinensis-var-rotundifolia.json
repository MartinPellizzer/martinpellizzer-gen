    "intro": "Iozoste chinensis var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed iozoste, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive round or oval-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
