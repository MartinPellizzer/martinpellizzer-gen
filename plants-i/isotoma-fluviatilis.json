    "intro": "Isotoma fluviatilis, commonly known as the river sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Isotoma fluviatilis plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
