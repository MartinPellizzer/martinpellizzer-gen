    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium f. albopicta, commonly known as the white-veined holly, is a cultivar of the common holly, characterized by its striking white or pale green veins on a dark green background. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The leaves are glossy and have a serrated margin, with the distinctive white veins that set it apart from other holly varieties. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
