It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ease of care. However, it is also known to host mealybugs, which can make it a potential pest in indoor gardening."
