    "intro": "Ilex nitida subsp. bahiahondica, commonly known as the Bahia holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and parts of Cuba. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and geographic distribution compared to other Ilex nitida varieties."
