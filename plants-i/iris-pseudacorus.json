    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features striking yellow flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, blooming from June to August. The plant has sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and alter wetland ecosystems."
