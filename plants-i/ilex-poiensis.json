    "intro": "Ilex poiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Ilex poiensis thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its ecological significance, it is considered a keystone species in Hawaiian ecosystems."
