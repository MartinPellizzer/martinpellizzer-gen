    "intro": "Indigofera frondosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in nutrient-poor environments. The plant is also valued for its historical use in dye production and as a forage crop for livestock."
