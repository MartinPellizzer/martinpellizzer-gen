It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. Indigofera cinerea is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
