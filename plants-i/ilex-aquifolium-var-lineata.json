    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. lineata, commonly known as the variegated holly, is a cultivar of the common holly. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display a combination of green and white or yellow patterns. The plant is evergreen, featuring glossy, spiny leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard holly. It produces small, red berries in the winter, which are an important food source for birds. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
