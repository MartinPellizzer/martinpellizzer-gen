    "intro": "Ilex dasyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex dasyphylla thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and swamps. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
