    "intro": "Inga biglobosa, commonly known as the \"bottle tree\" or \"biglobosa,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and its distinctive, bottle-shaped trunk that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing two large, bean-like seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Inga biglobosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in ecological systems."
