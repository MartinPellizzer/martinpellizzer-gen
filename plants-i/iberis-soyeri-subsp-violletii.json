    "intro": "Iberis soyeri subsp. violletii, commonly known as the violet-flowered candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale violet, blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and prolonged flowering period."
