    "intro": "Isoglossa faulknerae, commonly known as the Falkner's isoglossa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Isoglossa faulknerae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
