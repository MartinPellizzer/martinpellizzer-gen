    "intro": "Ilex colchica, commonly known as the Caucasian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex colchica is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
