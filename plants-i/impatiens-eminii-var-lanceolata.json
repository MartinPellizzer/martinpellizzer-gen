It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of delicate, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It has a trailing growth habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
