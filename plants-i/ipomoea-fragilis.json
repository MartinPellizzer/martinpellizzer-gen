    "intro": "Ipomoea fragilis, commonly known as the brittle morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a rapid growth habit, often reaching lengths of several meters. Its stems are weak and tend to break easily, hence the common name. Ipomoea fragilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
