    "intro": "Indigofera spicata var. siamensis, commonly known as Siam indigo, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has been historically used for its dye-producing properties, though its botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
