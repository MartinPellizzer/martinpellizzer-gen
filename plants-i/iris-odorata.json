    "intro": "Iris odorata, commonly known as the sweet iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. Iris odorata is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in perfumery."
