    "intro": "Iva ambrosiifolia var. lobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marshelder, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
