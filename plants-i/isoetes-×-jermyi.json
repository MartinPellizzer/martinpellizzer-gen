It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in wet, boggy environments. The plant is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a spore cone at the tip of the stem. Isoetes \u00d7 jermyi is a naturally occurring hybrid between Isoetes australis and Isoetes papuana, showcasing genetic diversity within the genus. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
