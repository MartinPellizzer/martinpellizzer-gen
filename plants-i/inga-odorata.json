    "intro": "Inga odorata, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and compound leaves that are trifoliate in structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or pale green, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, round seeds. Inga odorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
