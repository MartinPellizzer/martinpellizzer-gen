    "intro": "Iria macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed iris, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
