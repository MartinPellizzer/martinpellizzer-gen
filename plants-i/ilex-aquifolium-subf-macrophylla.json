    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium subf. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved holly, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are broader and more elongated compared to typical holly species. The leaves are usually leathery and have serrated edges, with a distinctive spiny appearance. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and winter interest."
