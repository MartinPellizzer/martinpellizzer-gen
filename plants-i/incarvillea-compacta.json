    "intro": "Incarvillea compacta, commonly known as the compact incarvillea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
