    "intro": "Isoetes tiguliana, commonly known as the zigzag watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its unique, spiral arrangement of spore-bearing stalks, which give it its common name. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its morphology includes a short, robust rhizome with dense clusters of spore cases. Isoetes tiguliana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth."
