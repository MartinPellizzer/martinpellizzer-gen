    "intro": "Iberis arabica, commonly known as white candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has pinnately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Iberis arabica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
