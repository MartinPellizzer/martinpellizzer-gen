It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Iphigenia somaliensis is often found growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to extreme conditions."
