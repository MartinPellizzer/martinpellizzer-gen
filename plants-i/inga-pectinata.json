    "intro": "Inga pectinata, commonly known as the yellow inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along riverbanks. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Inga pectinata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its natural environment."
