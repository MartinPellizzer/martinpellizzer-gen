    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. tokarensis, commonly known as Japanese holly or tokarensis holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves with wavy margins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its dense foliage and year-round color. This variety is valued for its adaptability and ability to maintain its shape with minimal pruning."
