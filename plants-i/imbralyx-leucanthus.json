    "intro": "Imbralyx leucanthus, commonly known as the silver-flowered ivy, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features cascading vines with small, waxy leaves that have a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
