It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Illecebrum pungens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
