    "intro": "Impatiens inconspicua var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender touch-me-not, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine, silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
