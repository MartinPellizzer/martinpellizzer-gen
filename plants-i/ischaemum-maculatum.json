    "intro": "Ischaemum maculatum, commonly known as spotted grass, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lipped flowers, typically in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Ischaemum maculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
