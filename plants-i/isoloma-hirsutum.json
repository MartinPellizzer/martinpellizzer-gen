    "intro": "Isoloma hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy isoloma, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Isoloma hirsutum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
