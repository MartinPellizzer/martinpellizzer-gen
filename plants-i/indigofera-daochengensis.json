    "intro": "Indigofera daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng indigo plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet, China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods and are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
