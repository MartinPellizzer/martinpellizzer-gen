    "intro": "Ipomoea tenuirostris subsp. tenuirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctively narrow petiole, and its flowers are typically pale blue to violet, opening in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oblong seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
