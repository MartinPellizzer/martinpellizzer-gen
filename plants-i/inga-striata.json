    "intro": "Inga striata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and a distinctive, smooth, dark green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its rapid growth rate makes it useful for agroforestry and soil stabilization. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
