    "intro": "Ilex manitzii, commonly known as the Manitzii holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex manitzii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and winter interest."
