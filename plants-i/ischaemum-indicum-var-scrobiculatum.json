    "intro": "Ischaemum indicum var. scrobiculatum, commonly known as the hairy barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can become a troublesome weed in cultivated areas."
