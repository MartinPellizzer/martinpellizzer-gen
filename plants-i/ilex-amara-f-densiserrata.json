    "intro": "Ilex amara f. densiserrata, commonly known as the dense-toothed holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, serrated leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
