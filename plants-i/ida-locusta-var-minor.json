    "intro": "Ida locusta var. minor, commonly known as the lesser locust. It is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia, characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
