    "intro": "Iris marschalliana, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. The iris is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing nectar for pollinators."
