The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with flowers that have three upright petals and three drooping sepals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes across temperate regions."
