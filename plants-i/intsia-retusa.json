It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or white, followed by woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline water, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Its roots help stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
