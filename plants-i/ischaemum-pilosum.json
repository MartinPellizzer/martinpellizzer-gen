    "intro": "Ischaemum pilosum, commonly known as hairy foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually pale green and have a slightly rough texture. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family."
