    "intro": "Ipomoea sinuata var. subintegra, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant produces tendrils that help it climb and spread along structures, making it a common sight in gardens and natural habitats. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies."
