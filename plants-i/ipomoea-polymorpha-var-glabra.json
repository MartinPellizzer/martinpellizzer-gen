    "intro": "Ipomoea polymorpha var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue, violet, or white in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The smooth glabrous leaves and stems distinguish this variety from other forms of Ipomoea polymorpha."
