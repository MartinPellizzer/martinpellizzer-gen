    "intro": "Indigofera campestris f. vera, commonly known as the true wild indigo, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges and along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its fibrous roots and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
