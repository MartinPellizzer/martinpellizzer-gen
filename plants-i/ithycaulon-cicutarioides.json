    "intro": "Ithycaulon cicutarioides, commonly known as the false hogweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
