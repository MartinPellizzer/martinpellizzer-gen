    "intro": "Isachne stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Isachne stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
