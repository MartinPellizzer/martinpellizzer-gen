    "intro": "Ibidium porrifolium, commonly known as the leafy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features small, green, leaf-like structures that are actually modified stems, and its true leaves are tiny and often submerged. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic invertebrates. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, causing the bladder to snap shut rapidly. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems."
