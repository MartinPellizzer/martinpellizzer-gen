    "intro": "Iberis rifana, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Iberis rifana is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
