    "intro": "Irmischia paralias, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Irmischia paralias plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
