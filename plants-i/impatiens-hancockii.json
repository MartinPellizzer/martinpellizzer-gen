    "intro": "Impatiens hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's impatiens, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, humid environments. It is often found in shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions and microclimates for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
