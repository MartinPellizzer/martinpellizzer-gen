    "intro": "Inversodicraea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf inversodicraea, is a small shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
