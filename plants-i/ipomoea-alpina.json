    "intro": "Ipomoea alpina, commonly known as the alpine morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is a perennial vine that thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in high-altitude forests and rocky outcrops. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, typically blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, while its stems are slender and climbing. Ipomoea alpina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
