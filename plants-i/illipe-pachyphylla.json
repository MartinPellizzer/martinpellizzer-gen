    "intro": "Illipe pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved illipe, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
