    "intro": "Ilex purpurea, commonly known as the purpleleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex purpurea typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild winters."
