It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often marked with intricate patterns of cream and green. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative climbing plant."
