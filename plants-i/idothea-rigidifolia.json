    "intro": "Idothea rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved idothea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rigid, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Idothea rigidifolia is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
