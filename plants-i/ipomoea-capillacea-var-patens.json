    "intro": "Ipomoea capillacea var. patens, commonly known as the spreading morning glory, is a flowering vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and lavender, often opening in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant can become invasive if not properly managed."
