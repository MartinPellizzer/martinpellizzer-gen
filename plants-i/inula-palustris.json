    "intro": "Inula palustris, commonly known as swamp ragwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its wet environment. Inula palustris plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native wetland ecosystems."
