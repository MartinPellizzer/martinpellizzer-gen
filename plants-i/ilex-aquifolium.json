    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium, commonly known as the common holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often spiny at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ilex aquifolium thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening. Its evergreen foliage provides year-round visual interest in landscapes."
