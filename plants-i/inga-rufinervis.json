    "intro": "Inga rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance. The species also has potential for use in agroforestry due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
