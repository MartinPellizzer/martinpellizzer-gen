    "intro": "Ilex cerasifolia, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, cherry-like berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its dense foliage and year-round appearance make it suitable for hedges and landscape design."
