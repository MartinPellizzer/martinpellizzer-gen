    "intro": "Iris fulva, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, topped with showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan shape at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense colonies in wetland environments. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
