It features glossy, broad elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are ornamental but not edible for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense foliage and winter interest make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
