    "intro": "Illicium modestum, commonly known as the Chinese star anise, is a deciduous shrub native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the star anise (Illicium verum). The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the distinctive, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine."
