    "intro": "Ipomoea herpeana, commonly known as the blue morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close in the late afternoon. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in gardens. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly due to its vigorous climbing nature."
