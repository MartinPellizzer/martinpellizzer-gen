    "intro": "Iondra arabica, commonly known as Arabica coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and parts of Sudan, where it thrives in tropical climates with consistent temperatures and high altitudes. The plant produces red berries that contain two seeds, which are the primary source of the coffee beans used in coffee production. Arabica plants are known for their delicate flavor profile and lower caffeine content compared to other coffee species. They require careful cultivation, including shade-grown conditions and specific soil pH levels, to produce high-quality beans."
