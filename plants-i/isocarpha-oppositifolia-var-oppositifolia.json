    "intro": "Isocarpha oppositifolia var. oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved isocarpha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are usually narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically yellow or green in color. It is native to certain regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
