It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive digitate pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically opening in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed carefully."
