    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. argentea-pectinata-minor, commonly known as the silver-leafed holly, is a variant of the common holly with distinctive silver-white variegation on its leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western regions of Europe. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and display a striking combination of green and white hues. It produces small, red berries in the winter, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
