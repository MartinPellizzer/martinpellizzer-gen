    "intro": "Ischaemum pectinatum, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, especially along the midrib. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Ischaemum pectinatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
