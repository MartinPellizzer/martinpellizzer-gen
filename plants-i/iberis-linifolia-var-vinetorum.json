It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and xeriscaping."
