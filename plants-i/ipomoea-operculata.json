It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive in some areas."
