    "intro": "Ilex bonincola var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the Bonin Islands. It features glossy, dark green, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
