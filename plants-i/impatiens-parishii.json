    "intro": "Impatiens parishii, commonly known as the Sierra Leone impatiens, is a flowering plant native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that burst open to disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily of interest to botanists and conservationists."
