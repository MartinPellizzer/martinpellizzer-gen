    "intro": "Iriartea zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora's pita, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico. It is a medium-sized palm characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in branched inflorescences, followed by dark blue, spherical berries. Iriartea zamorensis is adapted to shady, moist environments and is often found growing in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
