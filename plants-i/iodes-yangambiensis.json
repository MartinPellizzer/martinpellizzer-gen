    "intro": "Iodes yangambiensis, commonly known as the Yangambi ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for centuries, making it a valuable but endangered species. It plays a crucial role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to deforestation and habitat loss, Iodes yangambiensis is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
