    "intro": "Ipomoea aurifolia, commonly known as the golden leaf morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of golden-yellow hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which open in the morning and close at dusk. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for climbing structures or as a ground cover in warm climates. Ipomoea aurifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
