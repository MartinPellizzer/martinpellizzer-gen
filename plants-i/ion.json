    "intro": "Ion, commonly known as the ion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant contains compounds such as apiol and limonene, which contribute to its distinctive scent and potential medicinal properties. Ion is also valued for its ornamental appeal, with finely cut foliage that adds visual interest to gardens. However, it should be handled with care, as some parts of the plant can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
