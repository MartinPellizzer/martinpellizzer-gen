    "intro": "Isolepis varians, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Isolepis varians is often found in shallow water or moist soil, contributing to the ecological stability of its environment. Its ability to thrive in wet conditions makes it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
