    "intro": "Ilex litseifolia, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Ilex litseifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat in its native range."
