    "intro": "Iocaulon pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, blue or purple flowers. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
