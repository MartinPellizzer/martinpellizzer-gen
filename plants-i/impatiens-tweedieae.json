    "intro": "Impatiens tweedieae, commonly known as the Tweedie's impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is a member of the Balsaminaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
