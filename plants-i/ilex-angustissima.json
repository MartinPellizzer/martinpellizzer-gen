    "intro": "Ilex angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex angustissima is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9."
