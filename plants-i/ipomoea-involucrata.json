    "intro": "Ipomoea involucrata, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, lobed leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and showy flowers make it both a popular ornamental and an invasive species in some regions."
