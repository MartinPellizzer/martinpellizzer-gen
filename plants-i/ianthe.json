    "intro": "Ianthe, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that are typically tubular or spurred in shape. Ianthe species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas, and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Their leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, with some species having hairy or waxy surfaces. The flowers are often pollinated by birds or insects, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats."
