    "intro": "Ipomoea inaequisepala, commonly known as the unequal-sepal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces five unequal sepals that are often more prominent than the petals, a distinguishing feature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
