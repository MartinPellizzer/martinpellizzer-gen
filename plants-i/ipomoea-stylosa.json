It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that allow it to climb or trail along surfaces. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ipomoea stylosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
