    "intro": "Isachne miliacea, commonly known as millet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Isachne miliacea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
