It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The flowers are typically pale blue to violet, with five petals and a tubular corolla. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black hairy foliage, which gives it its common name."
