    "intro": "Iberis aurosica subsp. aurosica, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are lobed and covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-resistant nature."
