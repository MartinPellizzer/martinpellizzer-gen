    "intro": "Ilex sideroxyloides f. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
