    "intro": "Ipomoea humifera, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows close to the ground, with trailing stems that can spread up to several meters. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize the plant in loose soil. Ipomoea humifera is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun."
