    "intro": "Isolona ghesquierei var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long pedicellate isolona, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features elongated pedicels, which are the stalks supporting its small, daisy-like flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
