    "intro": "Ilex pleurostachys, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or whitish wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex pleurostachys thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for landscaping in drought-prone regions."
