    "intro": "Impatiens macrovexilla var. yaoshanensis, commonly known as the Yaoshan impatiens, is a rare and unique variant of the impatiens genus native to China. It is characterized by its striking, large, and velvety petals that are typically a deep red or maroon color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal cymes, and its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections."
