    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping holly, is a unique variant of the common holly. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant features small, spiny leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This cultivar is often used in ornamental gardening for its graceful, flowing form."
