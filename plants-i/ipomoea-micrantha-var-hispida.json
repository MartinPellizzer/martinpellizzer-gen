    "intro": "Ipomoea micrantha var. hispida, commonly known as the rough-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
