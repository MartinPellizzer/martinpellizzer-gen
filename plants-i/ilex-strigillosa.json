    "intro": "Ilex strigillosa, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex strigillosa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
