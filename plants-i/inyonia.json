It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant has a woody stem with thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Inyonia thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sunlight to flourish. Its unique appearance and symbolic significance make it a prized specimen in botanical gardens and traditional medicine."
