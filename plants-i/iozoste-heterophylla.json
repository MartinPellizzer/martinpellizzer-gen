    "intro": "Iozoste heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf iozoste, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which vary depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
