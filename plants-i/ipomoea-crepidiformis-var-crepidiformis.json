    "intro": "Ipomoea crepidiformis var. crepidiformis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, colorful flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet, blue, or white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain environments. The vine-like stems allow it to climb or spread across the ground, often forming dense mats."
