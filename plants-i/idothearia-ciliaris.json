    "intro": "Idothearia ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy seed heads. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Idothearia ciliaris plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
