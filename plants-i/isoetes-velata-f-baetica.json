    "intro": "Isoetes velata f. baetica, commonly known as the Baetican watermoss, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant has a unique reproductive system involving spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It is typically found in shallow, still waters with soft sediment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
