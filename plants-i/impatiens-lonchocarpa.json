    "intro": "Impatiens lonchocarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited impatiens, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that remain attached to the stem, a unique feature that distinguishes it from many other impatiens species. Its foliage consists of ovate to lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Impatiens lonchocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
