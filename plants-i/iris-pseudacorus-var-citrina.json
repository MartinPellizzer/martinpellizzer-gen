    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus var. citrina, commonly known as the golden iris, is a striking aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. Its leaves are sword-shaped and can reach up to 1 meter in length, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments."
