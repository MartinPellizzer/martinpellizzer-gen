    "intro": "Isolepis semipedunculata, commonly known as the narrow-panicle sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it often forms dense colonies in its native range. Isolepis semipedunculata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
