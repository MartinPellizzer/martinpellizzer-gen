It thrives in brackish or saline environments, showcasing its adaptability to high-salinity conditions. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its heart-shaped leaves are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps reduce water loss. Icica maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
