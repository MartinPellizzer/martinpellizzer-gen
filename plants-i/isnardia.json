    "intro": "Isnardia, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its scientific name, *Saxifraga arenaria*, reflects its preference for sandy or rocky habitats. Isnardia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
