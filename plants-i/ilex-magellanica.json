    "intro": "Ilex magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Ilex magellanica is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and partial shade."
