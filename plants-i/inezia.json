    "intro": "Inezia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Inezia species typically have hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and drought tolerance. The genus includes several species, such as Inezia microglossa and Inezia scabra, which are often found in rocky soils and desert plains."
