    "intro": "Ilex synpyrena, commonly known as the Pyrenean holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex synpyrena thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
