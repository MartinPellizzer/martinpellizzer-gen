    "intro": "Inga racemaria, commonly known as the red-veined or white-flowered inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Inga racemaria is also valued for its role in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
