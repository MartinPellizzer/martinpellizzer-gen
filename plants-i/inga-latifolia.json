    "intro": "Inga latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically broad and divided into several lobes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Inga latifolia is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports ecological balance."
