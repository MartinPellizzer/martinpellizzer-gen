    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its notably larger, broader leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the British Isles, often found in woodland and hedgerow habitats. The leaves are typically dark green with spiny margins, and the plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its dense foliage and winter interest. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade to full sun."
