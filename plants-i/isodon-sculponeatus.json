    "intro": "Isodon sculponeatus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, oblong leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to arid environments. Isodon sculponeatus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert and scrubland habitats."
