    "intro": "Inga villosa, commonly known as the silky sycamore or velvet tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
