    "intro": "Ipomoea tuberculata var. odontosepala, commonly known as the toothed-lobed morning glory, is a striking tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and vivid, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to deep purple. The flowers typically open in the morning and close at dusk, a trait common among many morning glory species. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
