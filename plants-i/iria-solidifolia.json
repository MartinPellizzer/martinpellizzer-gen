    "intro": "Iria solidifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved iria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Iria solidifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
