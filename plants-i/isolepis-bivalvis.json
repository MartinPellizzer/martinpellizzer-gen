    "intro": "Isolepis bivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Isolepis bivalvis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
