    "intro": "Ilex trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Ilex trachyphylla is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
