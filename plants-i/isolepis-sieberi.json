    "intro": "Isolepis sieberi, commonly known as the common tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that form compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. Isolepis sieberi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
