    "intro": "Ifloga woodii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the humid forests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ifloga woodii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
