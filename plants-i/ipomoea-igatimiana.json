It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and has a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to support itself on structures. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea igatimiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
