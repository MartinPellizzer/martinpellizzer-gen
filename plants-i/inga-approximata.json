    "intro": "Inga approximata, commonly known as the common inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical rainforests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance. Inga approximata plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
