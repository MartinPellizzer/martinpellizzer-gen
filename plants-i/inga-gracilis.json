    "intro": "Inga gracilis, commonly known as the slender inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often climbing habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with slender leaflets that contribute to its overall delicate appearance. Inga gracilis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in agroforestry systems."
