It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and emits a sweet fragrance, particularly in the evening. Its vines can grow up to 10 meters long, making it a vigorous climber. Ipomoea crinita is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
