    "intro": "Indigofera lateritia, commonly known as the rock indigo, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in degraded landscapes, making it valuable for ecological restoration. Indigofera lateritia is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
