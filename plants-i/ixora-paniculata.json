    "intro": "Ixora paniculata, commonly known as the flame-of-the-forest, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bright orange-red inflorescences that bloom profusely during the rainy season. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its flowers are not only visually striking but also attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
