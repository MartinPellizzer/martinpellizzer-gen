    "intro": "Ixodia achilleoides subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune ixodia, is a small, succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of salt and wind. This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
