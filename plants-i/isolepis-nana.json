    "intro": "Isolepis nana, commonly known as dwarf spike-rush, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Isolepis nana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
