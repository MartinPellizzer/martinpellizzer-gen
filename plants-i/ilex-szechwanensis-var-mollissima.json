    "intro": "Ilex szechwanensis var. mollissima, commonly known as the Sichuan holly, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically leathery and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
