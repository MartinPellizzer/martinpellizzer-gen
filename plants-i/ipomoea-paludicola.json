    "intro": "Ipomoea paludicola, commonly known as the marsh morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming primarily in the early morning. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in marshy environments, contributing to wetland ecology. Ipomoea paludicola is typically found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
