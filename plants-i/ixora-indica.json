It is characterized by its clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
