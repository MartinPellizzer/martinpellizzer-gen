It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oblong seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.
