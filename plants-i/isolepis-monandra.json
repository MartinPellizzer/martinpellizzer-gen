    "intro": "Isolepis monandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the foliage. Isolepis monandra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
