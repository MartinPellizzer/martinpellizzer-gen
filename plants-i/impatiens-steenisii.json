    "intro": "Impatiens steenisii, commonly known as the Bornean impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often found growing along forest floors and in undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
