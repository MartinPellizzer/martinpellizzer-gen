    "intro": "Ischaemum ritchiei, commonly known as Ritchie's grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its ecological adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
