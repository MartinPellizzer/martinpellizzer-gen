    "intro": "Iridorkis equitiris, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features elegant, silver-green leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its blooming period typically occurs during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Iridorkis equitiris is considered a vulnerable species."
