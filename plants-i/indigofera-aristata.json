    "intro": "Indigofera aristata, commonly known as the Mexican indigo or mountain indigo, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil. The plant has been used traditionally for its dyeing properties and medicinal applications."
