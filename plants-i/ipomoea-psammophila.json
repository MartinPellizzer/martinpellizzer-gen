    "intro": "Ipomoea psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Ipomoea psammophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native ecosystems."
