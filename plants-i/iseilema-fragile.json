    "intro": "Iseilema fragile, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a delicate tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are usually light green and tend to wither easily, contributing to its common name. Iseilema fragile is relatively rare and requires careful cultivation due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
