    "intro": "Ilysanthes veronicifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, often giving it a delicate appearance. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, though it can become semi-woody in certain conditions. Ilysanthes veronicifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
