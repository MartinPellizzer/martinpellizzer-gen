    "intro": "Iris ruthenica var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear a single, showy blue to violet flower at the top. The leaves are grass-like, sword-shaped, and arranged in a fan-like pattern around the base. The plant produces a distinctive, three-parted flower with a spurred petal and three upright petals. It is adapted to moist soil conditions and plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators."
