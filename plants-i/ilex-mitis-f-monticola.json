It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Ilex mitis f. monticola is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in woodland settings."
