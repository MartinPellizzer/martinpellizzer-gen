    "intro": "Imerinorchis brachyceras, commonly known as the narrow-capped marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and damp woodlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
