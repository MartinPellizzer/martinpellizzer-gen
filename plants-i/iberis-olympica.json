    "intro": "Iberis olympica, commonly known as the Olympic carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of bright pink, white, or red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features rounded, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Iberis olympica is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in horticultural displays."
