    "intro": "Iresine latifolia, commonly known as the flame flower or red leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, crimson-red leaves that contrast sharply with its pale green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are usually clustered in spikes. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Iresine latifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and ability to add color to shaded garden spaces."
