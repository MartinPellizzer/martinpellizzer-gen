It features a single, fleshy, red-orange root that is both visually distinctive and chemically significant. The plant produces showy, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. The botanical name reflects its blood-red root and its historical use in traditional medicine."
