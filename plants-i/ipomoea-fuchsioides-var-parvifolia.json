    "intro": "Ipomoea fuchsioides var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard fuchsioides variety. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for climbing structures or as a ground cover in gardens."
