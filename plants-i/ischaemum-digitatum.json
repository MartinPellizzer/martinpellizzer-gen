    "intro": "Ischaemum digitatum, commonly known as the slender dogstail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features fine, tufted inflorescences that resemble a dog's tail, composed of closely packed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Ischaemum digitatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
