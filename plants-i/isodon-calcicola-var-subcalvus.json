    "intro": "Isodon calcicola var. subcalvus, commonly known as the hairy leaved germander, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its more densely hairy foliage and slightly different floral structure."
