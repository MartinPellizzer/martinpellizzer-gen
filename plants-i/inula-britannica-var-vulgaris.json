    "intro": "Inula britannica var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common elecampane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, hollow stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and large, yellow composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with rough textures and a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
