    "intro": "Iriartea megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, slow-growing cycad native to the rainforests of northern South America. It is characterized by its massive, fern-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters, making it one of the tallest cycads. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its humid, tropical habitat. The species is also noted for its unique, palm-like trunk and its role in traditional medicine and horticulture."
