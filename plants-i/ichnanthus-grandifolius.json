    "intro": "Ichnanthus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leafed marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its showy, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, forming in clusters at the base of the plant. Ichnanthus grandifolius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
