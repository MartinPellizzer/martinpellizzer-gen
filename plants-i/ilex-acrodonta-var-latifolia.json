    "intro": "Ilex acrodonta var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and adaptability to various soil types."
