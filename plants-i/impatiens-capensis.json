    "intro": "Impatiens capensis, commonly known as jewelweed, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing or upright growth habit and is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of orange, yellow, and red, which bloom from midsummer to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, sticky hairs. Impatiens capensis is also known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, as the pods explode when mature, launching seeds several feet away."
