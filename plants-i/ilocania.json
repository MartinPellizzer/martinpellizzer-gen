It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate and often colorful floral structures. The plant typically features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in various shades of white, yellow, and pink. Ilocania species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
