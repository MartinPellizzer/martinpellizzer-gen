It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the morning. It is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, often using its tendrils to support itself on structures. Ipomoea linifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
