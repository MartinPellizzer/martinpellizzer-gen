    "intro": "Isoloma jamesonioides, commonly known as the Jameson's isoloma, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
