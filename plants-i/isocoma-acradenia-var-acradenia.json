    "intro": "Isocoma acradenia var. acradenia, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
