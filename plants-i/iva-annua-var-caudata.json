    "intro": "Iva annua var. caudata, commonly known as the slender swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features slender, branching stems that often grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pink to reddish petals, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist or swampy soils. It serves as a host plant for several butterfly species, including the monarch and painted lady."
