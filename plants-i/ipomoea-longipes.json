    "intro": "Ipomoea longipes, commonly known as the long-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often appearing in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces cylindrical, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in some regions."
