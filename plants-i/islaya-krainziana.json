    "intro": "Islaya krainziana, commonly known as the Krasnoyarsk lily, is a rare and striking member of the Alstroemeriaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Siberia, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Islaya krainziana is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
