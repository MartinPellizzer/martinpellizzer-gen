    "intro": "Impatiens sterilis, commonly known as the barren impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Impatiens sterilis is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
