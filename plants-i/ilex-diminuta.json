    "intro": "Ilex diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, glossy dark green leaves that are usually oval in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Ilex diminuta thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
