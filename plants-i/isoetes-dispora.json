    "intro": "Isoetes dispora, commonly known as the scattered watermace, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spore-bearing sorus, which is typically located on the underside of its fronds. This plant thrives in shallow, still waters such as lakes and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to the substrate. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, with a distinct midrib. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
