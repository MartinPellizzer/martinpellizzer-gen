    "intro": "Isocoma eremophila, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Isocoma eremophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
