    "intro": "Isoetes histrix var. delalandei, commonly known as the Delalande's water horsetail, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its segmented, spore-bearing stems that grow submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces fertile strobili, or cones, which contain spores for reproduction. Its morphology includes whorled leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. This variety is typically found in still or slow-moving waters with muddy substrates."
