    "intro": "Impatiens biophytoides, commonly known as the ghost impatiens, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling the ghostly apparitions that inspired its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture, enhancing its ethereal appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
