    "intro": "Ilysanthes riparia, commonly known as the riverbank bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing soil along waterways."
