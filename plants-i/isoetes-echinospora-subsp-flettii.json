    "intro": "Isoetes echinospora subsp. flettii, commonly known as the Flett's quillwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its spore-bearing stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically submerged in water. This subspecies is native to freshwater habitats in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on specialized stems called strobils. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms."
