    "intro": "Ilex veitchii, commonly known as Veitch's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its hardy nature and attractive foliage make it a valuable addition to both landscape design and ecological restoration projects."
