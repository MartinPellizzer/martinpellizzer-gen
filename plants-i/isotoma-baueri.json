    "intro": "Isotoma baueri, commonly known as the dwarf edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Isotoma baueri is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, sunny conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
