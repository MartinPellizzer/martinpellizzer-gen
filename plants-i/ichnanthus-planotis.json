    "intro": "Ichnanthus planotis, commonly known as the flat-leaf marsh plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in early spring. Its root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecology. Ichnanthus planotis is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
