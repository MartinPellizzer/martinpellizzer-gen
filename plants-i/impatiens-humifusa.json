It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and are often covered in fine hairs. Small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
