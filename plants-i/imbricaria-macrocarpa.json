It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a complex rhizome system that anchors it to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Imbricaria macrocarpa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
