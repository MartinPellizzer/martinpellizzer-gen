    "intro": "Isoetes tuckermanii subsp. acadiensis, commonly known as the Acadian watermilfoil, is a rare aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the watermilfoil family (Podostemaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater streams and rivers, anchored by its rhizomes to the substrate. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne on short stalks and are pollinated by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
