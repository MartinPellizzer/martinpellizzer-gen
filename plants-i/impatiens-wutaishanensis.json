It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats within forest understories, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is highly valued for its ornamental qualities. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
