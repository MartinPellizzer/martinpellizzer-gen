It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to Central and South America. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that enclose small, white, trumpet-shaped flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance.
