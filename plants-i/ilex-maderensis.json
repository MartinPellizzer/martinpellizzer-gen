    "intro": "Ilex maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex maderensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient and ornamental plant in xeriscaped landscapes."
