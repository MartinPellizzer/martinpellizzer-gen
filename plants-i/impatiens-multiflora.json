The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Impatiens multiflora is often used in container gardening and as a ground cover due to its vigorous growth and ornamental value."
