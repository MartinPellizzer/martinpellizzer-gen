    "intro": "Ilex congesta, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex congesta is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and winter interest. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens in warmer climates."
