    "intro": "Ipomoea longistaminea, commonly known as the long-stamen morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces long, slender stamens, which give it its common name. It is a climbing vine that can reach significant lengths, often using its tendrils to support itself on structures. The flowers are usually blue or violet in color, though some varieties may exhibit white or pink hues."
