    "intro": "Ilex oligoneura, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex oligoneura thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and hammocks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a subtropical climate."
