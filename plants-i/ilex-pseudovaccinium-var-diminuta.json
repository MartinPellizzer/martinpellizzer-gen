    "intro": "Ilex pseudovaccinium var. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 feet, featuring dense, dark green foliage with spiny leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for use as a low-maintenance ornamental plant in gardens."
