    "intro": "Ischaemum indicum var. malacophyllum, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
