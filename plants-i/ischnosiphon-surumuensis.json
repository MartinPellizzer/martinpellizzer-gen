    "intro": "Ischnosiphon surumuensis, commonly known as the Surumu orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the surrounding air and substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
