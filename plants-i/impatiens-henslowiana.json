    "intro": "Impatiens henslowiana, commonly known as the \"blush impatiens,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that come in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a distinctive blushing effect on the petals. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring through early summer."
