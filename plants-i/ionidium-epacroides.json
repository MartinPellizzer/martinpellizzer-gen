It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white.
