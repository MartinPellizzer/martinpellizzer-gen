    "intro": "Ilex fructiclipeata, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically leathery and have a pointed shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, often found in forested areas. Ilex fructiclipeata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its year-round foliage and winter berries."
