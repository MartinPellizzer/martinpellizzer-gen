    "intro": "Ipomoea paucinervia, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 2 meters in height, featuring heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can become invasive if not managed. The flowers bloom in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
