    "intro": "Isachne truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often truncate at the tip. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically arranged in panicle-like structures. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Isachne truncata is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
