    "intro": "Iris nepalensis f. depauperata, commonly known as the Nepal iris, is a botanical variant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountain meadows. Its flowers are usually smaller and less showy compared to other iris species, with a more subdued color palette. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
