    "intro": "Illipe butyracea, commonly known as African shea tree, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces a fruit with a hard, woody shell enclosing a creamy, oily kernel. This kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its economic contributions."
