It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem with a single, showy flower at the top. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
