    "intro": "Ipomoea setifera var. orbicularis, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a velvety texture. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and the plant produces hairy, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This variant is distinct from the typical form of Ipomoea setifera due to its rounded, orbicular leaves."
