It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in spikes, blooming in late summer. Ittnera najas plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
