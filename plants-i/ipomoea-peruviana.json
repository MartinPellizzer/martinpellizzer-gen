    "intro": "Ipomoea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian morning glory, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces distinctive, spiral-shaped seed pods that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
