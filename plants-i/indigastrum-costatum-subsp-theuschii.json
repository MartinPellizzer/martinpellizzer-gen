    "intro": "Indigastrum costatum subsp. theuschii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's indigastrum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
