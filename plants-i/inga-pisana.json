    "intro": "Inga pisana, commonly known as the pink inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Inga pisana plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
