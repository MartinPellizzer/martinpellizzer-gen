    "intro": "Iris warleyensis, commonly known as the Warley iris, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive dark purple stripe. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
