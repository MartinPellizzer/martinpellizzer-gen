    "intro": "Ipomoea pentagona, commonly known as the pentagonal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive five-lobed structure, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along riverbanks and in moist, shady areas. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animal contact."
