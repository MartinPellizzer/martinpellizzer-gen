It is characterized by its large, broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
