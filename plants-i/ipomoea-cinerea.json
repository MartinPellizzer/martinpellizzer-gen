The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color. It blooms during the day, hence its common name, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Ipomoea cinerea is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
