    "intro": "Ischaemum jayachandranii, commonly known as Jayachandran's goatgrass, is a rare grass species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endemic and potentially endangered species."
