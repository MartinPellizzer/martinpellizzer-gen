It is a low-growing perennial with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry environments."
