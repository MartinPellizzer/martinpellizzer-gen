    "intro": "Ischaemum bolei, commonly known as the small brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually small and inconspicuous. Ischaemum bolei is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal environments."
