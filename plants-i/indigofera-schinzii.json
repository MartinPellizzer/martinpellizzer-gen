    "intro": "Indigofera schinzii, commonly known as the African indigo or Schinz's indigo, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. It produces pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in degraded soils."
