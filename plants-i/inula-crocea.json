    "intro": "Inula crocea, commonly known as the yellow cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Inula crocea is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
