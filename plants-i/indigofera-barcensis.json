    "intro": "Indigofera barcensis, commonly known as the Barcens indigo plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a leguminous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its historical use in dye production, particularly for yielding a blue pigment similar to traditional indigo."
