    "intro": "Ilex \u00d7 fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and year-round visual interest. The berries, while attractive, are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle the plant with care."
