    "intro": "Icacorea monteverdeana, commonly known as the Monteverde icacure, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive red or orange corona. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
