    "intro": "Ionopsidium abulense var. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern ionopsidium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
