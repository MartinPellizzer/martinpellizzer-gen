It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its compact growth habit and year-round flowering make it suitable for container gardening and landscape use."
