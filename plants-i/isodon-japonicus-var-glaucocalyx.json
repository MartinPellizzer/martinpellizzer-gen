    "intro": "Isodon japonicus var. glaucocalyx, commonly known as the Japanese isodon, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue due to a thick layer of trichomes, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
