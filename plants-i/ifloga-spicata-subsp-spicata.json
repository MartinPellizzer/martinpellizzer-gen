It is characterized by its erect stem, which is covered in stiff, spiny hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and also have a spiny texture, contributing to its defensive features. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
