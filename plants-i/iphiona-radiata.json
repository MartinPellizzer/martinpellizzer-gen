    "intro": "Iphiona radiata, commonly known as the radiant iphiona, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Iphiona radiata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
