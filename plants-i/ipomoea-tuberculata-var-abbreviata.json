It is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, warty tubercles on its stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it requires careful management in natural habitats."
