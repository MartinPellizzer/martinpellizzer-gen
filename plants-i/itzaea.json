It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Itzaea has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
