It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, which open in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
