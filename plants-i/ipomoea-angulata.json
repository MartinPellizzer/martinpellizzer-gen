It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaves and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, often using its tendrils to support itself on structures. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The plant is also known for its edible tubers, which have been used in traditional cuisines."
