    "intro": "Ipomoea eenii, commonly known as the Hawaiian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is typically found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs, while its vines can climb and trail along the ground. Ipomoea eenii is also noted for its short blooming period, with flowers opening in the early morning and closing by midday."
