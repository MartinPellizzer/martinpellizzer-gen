    "intro": "Ilex stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Ilex stenophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
