    "intro": "Isochilus linearis var. carnosiflorus, commonly known as the woolly linear orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces spikes of small, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, woolly texture on the petals and sepals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
