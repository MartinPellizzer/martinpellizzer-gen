    "intro": "Iridorkis gracilis, commonly known as the slender iridorkis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, velvety hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Iridorkis gracilis thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
