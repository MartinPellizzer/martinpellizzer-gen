    "intro": "Inga fastuosa, commonly known as the pink shower tree, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, inedible fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Inga fastuosa is also valued for its role in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
