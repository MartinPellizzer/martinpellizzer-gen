    "intro": "Ilex dichotoma, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, spiny leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex dichotoma thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a common ornamental plant in landscaping across its native range."
