    "intro": "Ichnanthus procurrens, commonly known as the creeping lily of the Nile, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, sandy soils along stream banks and in swamps. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are prostrate, often forming dense mats. Ichnanthus procurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
