    "intro": "Ilex cupreonitens, commonly known as the copperleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking coppery red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex cupreonitens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded garden settings."
