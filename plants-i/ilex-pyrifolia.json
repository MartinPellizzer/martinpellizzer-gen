It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex pyrifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
