    "intro": "Ipomoea graminiformis var. densifolia, commonly known as the denseleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine, dense hairs, giving the plant its varietal name. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically blue or purple, and bloom in the morning, hence the common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
