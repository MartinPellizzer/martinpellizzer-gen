It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, broad ovate leaves, and showy, spurred flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, white, and red. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
