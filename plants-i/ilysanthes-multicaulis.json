It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often branched and bear clusters of flowers, giving it its common name. Ilysanthes multicaulis is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes."
