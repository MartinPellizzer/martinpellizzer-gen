    "intro": "Isopogon prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate banksia, is a low-growing shrub native to Western Australia. It features dense, woody stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flower spikes during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating. Isopogon prostratus is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
