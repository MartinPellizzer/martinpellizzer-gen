The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its role in supporting pollinators like butterflies and bees. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in wetland ecosystems."
