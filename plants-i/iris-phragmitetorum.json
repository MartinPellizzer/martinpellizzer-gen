    "intro": "Iris phragmitetorum, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 60\u2013100 cm, featuring sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often reddish at the base. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to white flowers in late spring, arranged in a dense spike that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
