    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium f. arbutifolia, commonly known as the variegated holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow margins. It belongs to the Aquifoliaceae family and is native to western Europe, particularly the British Isles. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and container planting. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and winter interest."
