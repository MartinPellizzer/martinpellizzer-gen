    "intro": "Isalus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's isalus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth form and unique adaptations to high-altitude environments. The plant possesses small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Isalus humbertii is considered a vulnerable species."
