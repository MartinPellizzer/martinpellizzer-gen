    "intro": "Ischnanthus woodfordioides, commonly known as the Woodford's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a unique root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Ischnanthus woodfordioides is highly specialized, requiring specific microhabitats and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its conservation status highlights the fragility of its ecological niche and the need for continued protection."
