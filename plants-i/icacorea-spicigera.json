    "intro": "Icacorea spicigera, commonly known as the spiny coral tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage, which provide structural support and protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. Icacorea spicigera is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
