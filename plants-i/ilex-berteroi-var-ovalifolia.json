It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
