    "intro": "Ilex crenata f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Japanese holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its cascading growth habit. Its foliage consists of small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This ornamental plant is often used in landscape design for its unique, cascading form and year-round visual interest."
