    "intro": "Isolepis rigescens, commonly known as the rigid flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dense clusters and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Isolepis rigescens is often found in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its structure and growth habits make it well-adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat."
