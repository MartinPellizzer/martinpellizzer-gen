    "intro": "Ilex brasiliensis f. balansae, commonly known as the Brazilian holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and year-round appearance. This form is a natural variant of the species, exhibiting distinct morphological characteristics that set it apart from the typical Ilex brasiliensis."
