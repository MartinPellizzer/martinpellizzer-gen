    "intro": "Iguanura polymorpha var. integra, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal areas. The plant exhibits pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that extend above the soil to facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces woody fruits that contain buoyant seeds. This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
