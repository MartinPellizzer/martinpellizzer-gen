    "intro": "Isocoma megalantha, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single large flower. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to conserve water. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Isocoma megalantha is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
