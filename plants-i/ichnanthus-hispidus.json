It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, blooming in early spring. Ichnanthus hispidus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is a rhizomatous plant, meaning it spreads through underground stems, forming dense colonies."
