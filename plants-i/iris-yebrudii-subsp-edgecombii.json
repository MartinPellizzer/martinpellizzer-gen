    "intro": "Iris yebrudii subsp. edgecombii, commonly known as the Edgecomb iris, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct genetic and morphological traits compared to other iris species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
