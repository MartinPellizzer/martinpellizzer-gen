    "intro": "Isoetes riparia var. canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian water starwort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its dimorphic spore-bearing structures, with the sporophyte producing spores in specialized stalked capsules. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, with a dark green coloration. This variety is distinguished from the typical I. riparia by its geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences."
