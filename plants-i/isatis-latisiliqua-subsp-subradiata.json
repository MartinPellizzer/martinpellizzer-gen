    "intro": "Isatis latisiliqua subsp. subradiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf woad, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is valued for its historical use in dye production and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
