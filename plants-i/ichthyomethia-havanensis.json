    "intro": "Ichthyomethia havanensis, commonly known as the Cuban water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the freshwater habitats of Cuba. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are divided into small, serrated segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
