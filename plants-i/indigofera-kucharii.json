The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its potential use in dyeing fabrics, similar to other species in the Indigofera genus."
