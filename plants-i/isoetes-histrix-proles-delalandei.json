    "intro": "Isoetes histrix proles delalandei, commonly known as the Delalande's horse-tail, is a species of water plant in the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spiky, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tip of the plant. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and shallow lakes. Its leaves are usually narrow and spirally arranged, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is notable for its ancient lineage, belonging to the order Isoetales, which dates back to the Carboniferous period."
