    "intro": "Ixodia achilleoides subsp. achilleoides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and often branched, with a tendency to remain close to the ground. The species is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils."
