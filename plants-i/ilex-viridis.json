    "intro": "Ilex viridis, commonly known as the green holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex viridis thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
