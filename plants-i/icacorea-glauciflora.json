It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Icacorea glauciflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
