    "intro": "Ipomoea funaria, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heliotropic flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. The plant is native to the Americas but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Its vine-like growth habit allows it to climb and trail along supports, often covering fences or trellises. The flowers are typically trumpet-shaped, with vibrant colors ranging from blue to purple, and are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
