It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark green leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for various birds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
