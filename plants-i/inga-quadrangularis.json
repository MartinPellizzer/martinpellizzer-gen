    "intro": "Inga quadrangularis, commonly known as the angular inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its quadrangular (four-sided) stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it useful in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
