It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet to purple flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately veined leaves and produces cylindrical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
