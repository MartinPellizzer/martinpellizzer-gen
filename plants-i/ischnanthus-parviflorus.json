    "intro": "Ischnanthus parviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, narrow leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with good drainage and full sun."
