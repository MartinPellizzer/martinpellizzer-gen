    "intro": "Inga villosissima, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
