    "intro": "Iresine celosioides var. verticillata, commonly known as the red-veined strobilanthes, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep red veins contrasting against its glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
