    "intro": "Ilex opaca f. subintegra, commonly known as the American holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with glossy dark green leaves that have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for hedges and ornamental landscaping. The subspecies subintegra is distinguished by its more compact form and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical American holly."
