    "intro": "Isopogon autumnalis, commonly known as the yellow honey bush, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Isopogon autumnalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
