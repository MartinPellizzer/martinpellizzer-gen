    "intro": "Isomeria, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Isomeria is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
