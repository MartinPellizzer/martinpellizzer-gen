    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. typica, commonly known as Japanese holly, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval-shaped leaves with wavy edges, which give it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges, borders, and container gardening."
