    "intro": "Isolepis carinata, commonly known as the ridge sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Isolepis carinata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
