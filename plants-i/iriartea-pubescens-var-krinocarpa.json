    "intro": "Iriartea pubescens var. krinocarpa, commonly known as the Krinocarpa cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and dense, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for protective measures."
