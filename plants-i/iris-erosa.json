    "intro": "Iris erosa, commonly known as the slender iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces showy, blue to violet-colored flowers with a distinctive three-parted structure. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Iris erosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
