    "intro": "Ischarum angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in tight, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
