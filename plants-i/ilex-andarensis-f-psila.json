    "intro": "Ilex andarensis f. psila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a rare botanical variant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its slender, lanceolate leaves that are often narrower than those of the typical Ilex andarensis. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
