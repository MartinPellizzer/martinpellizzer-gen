It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from summer to fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
