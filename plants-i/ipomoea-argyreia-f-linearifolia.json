    "intro": "Ipomoea argyreia f. linearifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf morning glory, is a variant of the species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from white to pale blue, often with a distinctive silver or white veining. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the stems are trailing and can grow quite long. This plant is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
