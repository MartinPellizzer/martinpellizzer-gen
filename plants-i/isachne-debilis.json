    "intro": "Isachne debilis, commonly known as slender isachne, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which contains two to three small, bracted flowers. Isachne debilis is often found in wetlands and is considered an indicator species for hydric soils due to its specific ecological requirements."
