    "intro": "Ipomoea perlonga, commonly known as the long-vine morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Ipomoea perlonga is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant."
