    "intro": "Iberis carnosa subsp. lereschiana, commonly known as the white-flowered candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage that is both ornamental and drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its historical use in horticulture dates back to the 18th century, where it was prized for its hardiness and floral display."
