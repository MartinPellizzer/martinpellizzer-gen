    "intro": "Ilex gardneriana, commonly known as the Gardner's holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. Ilex gardneriana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun."
