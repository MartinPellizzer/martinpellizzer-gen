    "intro": "Isostigma peucedanifolium var. peucedanifolium, commonly known as the peucedanifolium isostigma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
