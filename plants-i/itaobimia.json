    "intro": "Itaobimia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers. Itaobimia is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
