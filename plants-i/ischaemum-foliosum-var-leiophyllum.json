    "intro": "Ischaemum foliosum var. leiophyllum, commonly known as the smoothleaf beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, flat leaves that are smooth and hairless, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
