    "intro": "Iris montana, commonly known as the mountain iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three petals and three sepals. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Iris montana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
