    "intro": "Iris basaltica, commonly known as the basalt iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky and volcanic landscapes. The basalt iris is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to flourish in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
