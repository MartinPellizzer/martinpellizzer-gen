    "intro": "Ipomoea scopulina, commonly known as the rock morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial vine that thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and along roadsides. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, while its stems are woody and often climb by twining around supports. Ipomoea scopulina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
