    "intro": "Isatis lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian woad, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional dyeing processes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its historical significance lies in its use for producing indigo dye, similar to its more famous relative, Isatis tinctoria."
