    "intro": "Ilex scopulorum, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex scopulorum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and inland regions."
