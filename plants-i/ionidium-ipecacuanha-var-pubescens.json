    "intro": "Ionidium ipecacuanha var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy ipecacuanha, is a variant of the ipecacuanha plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical or subtropical regions. The hairy texture of its foliage is a notable botanical feature, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species."
