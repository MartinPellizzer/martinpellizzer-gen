    "intro": "Inga discolor, commonly known as the white inga, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. Inga discolor is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals."
