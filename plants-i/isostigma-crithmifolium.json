    "intro": "Isostigma crithmifolium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Isostigma crithmifolium is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
