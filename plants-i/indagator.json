    "intro": "Indagator, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrients, making it a unique example of a myco-heterotrophic plant. The plant produces striking white or pale purple flowers that bloom during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, the ghost orchid is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
