    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ideesia polycarpa, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various soil types and climates. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ecological impact."
