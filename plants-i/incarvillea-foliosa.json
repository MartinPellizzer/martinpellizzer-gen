    "intro": "Incarvillea foliosa, commonly known as the leafy incarvillea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Incarvillea foliosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
