    "intro": "Impatiens capensis f. platymeris, commonly known as the broad-leaf touch-me-not, is a variant of the common yellow root. It is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America, characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers, which are usually orange or yellow, are pollinated by insects and produce small, round seeds. This form is notable for its distinct leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Impatiens capensis."
