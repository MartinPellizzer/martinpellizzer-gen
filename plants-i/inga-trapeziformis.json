    "intro": "Inga trapeziformis, commonly known as the coffee tree or wild coffee, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its roots. It produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Inga trapeziformis is also valued for its role in agroforestry systems due to its shade-providing properties and soil enrichment capabilities."
