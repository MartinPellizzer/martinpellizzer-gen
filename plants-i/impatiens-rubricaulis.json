    "intro": "Impatiens rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red. The leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the stems are distinctly red, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
