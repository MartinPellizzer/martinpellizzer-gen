    "intro": "Ilex floribunda, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest and ability to maintain an attractive form throughout the year."
