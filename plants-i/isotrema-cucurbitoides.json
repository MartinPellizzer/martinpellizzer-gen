    "intro": "Isotrema cucurbitoides, commonly known as the \"bitterleaf vine,\" is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, green, edible fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its bitter taste, it is typically used in traditional medicine rather than as a food source."
