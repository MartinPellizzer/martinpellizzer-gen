    "intro": "Itea umbellata, commonly known as the sweetflag or water dropwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, giving it its scientific name. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic environments. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecology. Itea umbellata is typically found in shallow water or moist soils, often near streams, ponds, and marshes."
