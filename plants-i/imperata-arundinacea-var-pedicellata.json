    "intro": "Imperata arundinacea var. pedicellata, commonly known as purple muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking purple to pink inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense stands that can suppress other vegetation. Purple muhly is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
