    "intro": "Isoloma bogotense var. warscewiczii, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 isoloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive blue-green hue, while its small white flowers bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
