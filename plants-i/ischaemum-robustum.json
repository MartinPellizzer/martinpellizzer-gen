    "intro": "Ischaemum robustum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Ischaemum robustum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
