It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy feel. Ixora tenuiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hedge due to its compact growth and vibrant floral display."
