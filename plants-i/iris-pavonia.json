    "intro": "Iris pavonia, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features striking violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stalks and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Iris pavonia is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
