    "intro": "Ilex crenata var. paludosa, commonly known as the bog holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery foliage that is typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy environments. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with suitable conditions."
