    "intro": "Isolepis hemiuncialis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features dense, tufted growth with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies in saturated soils. Isolepis hemiuncialis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
