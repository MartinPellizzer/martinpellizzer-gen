    "intro": "Iris tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Iris tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
