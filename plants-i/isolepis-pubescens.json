    "intro": "Isolepis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-sided flowers that are wind-pollinated. Isolepis pubescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
