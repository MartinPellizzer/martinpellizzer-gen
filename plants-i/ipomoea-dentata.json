    "intro": "Ipomoea dentata, commonly known as the serrated morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to attach to supports. It blooms throughout the growing season, typically from spring to autumn, and produces showy, fragrant flowers. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals."
