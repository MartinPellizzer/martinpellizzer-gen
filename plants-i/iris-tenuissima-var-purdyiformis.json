    "intro": "Iris tenuissima var. purdyiformis, commonly known as the Purdy's iris, is a rare and delicate species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often more densely packed than that of the typical iris tenuissima, and it produces a distinctive, narrow flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
