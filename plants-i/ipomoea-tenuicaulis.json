    "intro": "Ipomoea tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slenderleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous annual vine native to Central and South America. It features slender, branching stems that climb by means of tendrils, and its leaves are typically alternate, heart-shaped, and finely toothed. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or purple, often opening in the morning. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, round seeds. Ipomoea tenuicaulis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and vigorous growth habit."
