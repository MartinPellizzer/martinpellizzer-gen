    "intro": "Inga sertulifera var. leptopus, commonly known as the slender pod inga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common understory species in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. The seeds are enclosed in elongated, fibrous pods that dehisce to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
