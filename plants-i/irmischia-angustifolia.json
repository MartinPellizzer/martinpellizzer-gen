    "intro": "Irmischia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved irmischia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southwestern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which attract specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
