    "intro": "Iberis linifolia subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
