    "intro": "Ionidium orchidiflorum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid of the highlands, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
