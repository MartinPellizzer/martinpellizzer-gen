    "intro": "Iris fulvaurea, commonly known as the golden iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its striking appearance and adaptability make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
