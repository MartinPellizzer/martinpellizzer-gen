    "intro": "Ixiolirion tataricum var. tataricum, commonly known as the Tatarian bulbous grass, is a perennial plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, arranged in a loose panicle. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, with the bulbs remaining dormant through winter."
