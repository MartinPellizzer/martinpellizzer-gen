    "intro": "Iris hartwegii subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable moist environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
