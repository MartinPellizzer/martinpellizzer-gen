    "intro": "Iriartea deltoidea, commonly known as the delta cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, woody trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
