    "intro": "Imperialis comosa, commonly known as the royal tufted plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white or pale blue flower heads that resemble tufts of cotton. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. Native to arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pollinator attractant, with its showy inflorescences drawing in bees and butterflies."
