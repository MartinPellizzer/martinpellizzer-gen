It is characterized by its strikingly contrasting leaf colors, typically featuring a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silver or white underside. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Impatiens dichroocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add visual interest to shaded garden spaces."
