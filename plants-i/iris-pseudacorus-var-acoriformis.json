    "intro": "Iris pseudacorus var. acoriformis, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a darker central stripe, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow in dense clumps, and it typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters. It thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, due to its preference for moist soil. However, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
