    "intro": "Ipomoea ternifolia subsp. leptotoma, commonly known as the slenderleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more slender than those of the main species. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often opening in the early morning. Its stems are hairy and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along fences or trees. The flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
