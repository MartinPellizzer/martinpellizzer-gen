It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and finely divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant is a perennial and grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native range."
