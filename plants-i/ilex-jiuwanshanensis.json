It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny leaves and small, dark berries. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. It exhibits a compact growth habit and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
