    "intro": "Ilex sessiliflora, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex sessiliflora thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
