    "intro": "Isolepis angelica, commonly known as the angel's grass, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a perennial plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and small, clustered flower spikes. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Isolepis angelica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
