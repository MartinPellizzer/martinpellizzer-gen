It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, often appearing in spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
