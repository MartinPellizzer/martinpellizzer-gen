    "intro": "Ilex stenura, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex stenura thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
