    "intro": "Isoloma elegans, commonly known as the elegant isoloma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Isoloma elegans is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
