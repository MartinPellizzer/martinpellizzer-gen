    "intro": "Ilex minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces tiny white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are ornamental and persist through the winter. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its dense foliage and year-round color, it is often used in landscaping for hedges or as a specimen plant."
