    "intro": "Indigofera tinctoria var. torulosa, commonly known as the dwarf indigo plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces indigo dye from its mature leaves, which have been historically used in textile dyeing. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. This variety is smaller than the standard Indigofera tinctoria, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
