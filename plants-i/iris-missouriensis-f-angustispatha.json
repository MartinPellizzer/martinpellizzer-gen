    "intro": "Iris missouriensis f. angustispatha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Missouri iris, is a botanical variant of the Missouri iris native to the central United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and its flowers are borne on tall, leafless stems. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
