    "intro": "Ilex symplociformis, commonly known as the Mexican holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Ilex symplociformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dense foliage and winter interest."
