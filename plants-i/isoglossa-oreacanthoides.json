It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.
