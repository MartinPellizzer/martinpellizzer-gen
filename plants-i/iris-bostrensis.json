    "intro": "Iris bostrensis, commonly known as the Bostrensis iris, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in forested or grassland habitats. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals, characteristic of the iris family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Iris bostrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant blooms."
