    "intro": "Indigofera spinosa, commonly known as prickly indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Indigofera spinosa is also known for its potential use in natural dyes and soil stabilization."
