    "intro": "Iberis soyeri, commonly known as the Armenian candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically produces basal leaves that are oval to linear in shape, with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Iberis soyeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, early spring blooms."
