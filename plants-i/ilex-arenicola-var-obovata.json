    "intro": "Ilex arenicola var. obovata, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical to obovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping in arid and coastal environments."
