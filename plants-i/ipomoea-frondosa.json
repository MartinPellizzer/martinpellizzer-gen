    "intro": "Ipomoea frondosa, commonly known as the fronded morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of violet or blue. The plant is a vine that can grow up to 10 feet long, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ipomoea frondosa is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
