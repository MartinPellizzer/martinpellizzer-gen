    "intro": "Isoleucas, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. The plants typically have evergreen foliage with leathery, glossy leaves that are often arranged in whorls. They produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and they are often grown for their ornamental value. Isoleucas prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full sunlight."
