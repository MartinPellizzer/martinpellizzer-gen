    "intro": "Iberis intermedia proles delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinian Candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited natural range."
