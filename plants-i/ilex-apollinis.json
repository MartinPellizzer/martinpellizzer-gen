    "intro": "Ilex apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex apollinis thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
