    "intro": "Ilex arimensis, commonly known as the Armenian holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex arimensis is adapted to rocky and mountainous terrain, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
