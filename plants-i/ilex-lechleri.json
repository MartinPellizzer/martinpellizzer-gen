    "intro": "Ilex lechleri, commonly known as the caucau or sangre de drago, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves and produces small, red berries that are rich in bioactive compounds. The plant is notable for its high concentration of mucilage, which gives it its traditional use in healing applications. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
