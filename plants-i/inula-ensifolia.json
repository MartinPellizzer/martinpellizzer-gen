    "intro": "Inula ensifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf inula, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Inula ensifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
