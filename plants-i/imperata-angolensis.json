    "intro": "Imperata angolensis, commonly known as the Angola grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Imperata angolensis is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and can be an indicator of certain ecological conditions."
