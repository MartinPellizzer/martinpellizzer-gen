    "intro": "Iris pumila var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow dwarf iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive violet-tinged center. The plant typically blooms in early spring and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats. Due to its compact size and vibrant color, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine gardens."
