    "intro": "Iodes philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue to blackish berries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation efforts."
