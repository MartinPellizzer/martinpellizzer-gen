    "intro": "Impatiens charanii, commonly known as the Kashmir rose or Himalayan impatiens, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in cool climates and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
