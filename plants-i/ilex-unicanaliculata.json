    "intro": "Ilex unicanaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-celled holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Ilex unicananiculata is often found in moist, acidic soils along streambanks and in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions where it is native."
