    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 cypriana, commonly known as the Cyprus iris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Iris germanica and Iris pallida. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, lavender-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Its leaves are sword-shaped and form a dense rosette at the base. The flowers are composed of three upright petals and three downward-facing sepals, with a prominent central style that extends beyond the petals."
