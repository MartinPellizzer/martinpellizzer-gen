    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western and central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically spiny on the edges, with a red or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and garden use."
