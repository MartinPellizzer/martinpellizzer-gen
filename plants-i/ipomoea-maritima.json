    "intro": "Ipomoea maritima, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Ipomoea maritima is adapted to coastal environments, with mechanisms to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding."
