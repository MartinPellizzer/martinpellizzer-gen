    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. fructu-nigro, commonly known as the black-fruited holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its dark, almost black berries. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The leaves are typically glossy, dark green, and have a spiny margin, typical of the Ilex genus. The berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are a key feature of this variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
