    "intro": "Ipomoea avicola, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
