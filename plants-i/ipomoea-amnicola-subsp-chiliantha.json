It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along stream banks and in moist, shaded areas. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, hence its common name.
