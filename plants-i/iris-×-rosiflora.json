    "intro": "Iris \u00d7 rosiflora, commonly known as the hybrid iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Iris germanica and Iris rosenfeldii, resulting in a plant that exhibits traits from both parents. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring sword-shaped leaves and showy, violet or blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for garden borders and landscaping. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their vibrant color and long-lasting bloom."
