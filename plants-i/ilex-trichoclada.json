    "intro": "Ilex trichoclada, commonly known as the hairy-leaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ilex trichoclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and winter interest. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes."
