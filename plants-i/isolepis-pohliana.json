    "intro": "Isolepis pohliana, commonly known as the Pohli's bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with cylindrical, grass-like stems. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Isolepis pohliana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic environments."
