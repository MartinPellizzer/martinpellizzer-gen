    "intro": "Isocarpha kunthii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows from a short, thick rootstock and has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped with hairy surfaces. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, bristly seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. Isocarpha kunthii is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to survive in poor soil conditions."
