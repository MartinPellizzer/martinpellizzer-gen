    "intro": "Ionidium botterii, commonly known as the Botterii's ionidium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to those of other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ionidium botterii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
