    "intro": "Ichnanthus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
