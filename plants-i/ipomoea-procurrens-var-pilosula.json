    "intro": "Ipomoea procurrens var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
