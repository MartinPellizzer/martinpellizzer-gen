    "intro": "Ilex pedunculosa f. aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange-leaf holly, is a variant of the evergreen holly species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking orange to red foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 15 feet. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in USDA hardiness zones 7 through 9."
