    "intro": "Ichnocarpus frutescens f. sogerensis, commonly known as the Sogerensian burr bush, is a shrub native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and woody, thorned stems that bear clusters of indehiscent pods. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, elliptical leaflets. The species is noted for its unique seed structure, which is adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals."
