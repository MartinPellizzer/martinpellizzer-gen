    "intro": "Isolepis tetragona, commonly known as the four-cornered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Isolepis tetragona is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
