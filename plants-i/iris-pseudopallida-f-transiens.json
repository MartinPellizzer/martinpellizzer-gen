    "intro": "Iris pseudopallida f. transiens, commonly known as the Transient White Iris, is a rare and elegant variant of the White Iris species. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which bloom briefly during the spring season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces showy, upright flower stalks. Due to its limited distribution and fleeting blooming period, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical gardens."
