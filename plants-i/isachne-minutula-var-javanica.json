It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its delicate foliage and resilience in humid conditions."
