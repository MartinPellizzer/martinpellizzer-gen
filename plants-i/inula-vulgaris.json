    "intro": "Inula vulgaris, commonly known as elecampane, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a tall herb that can grow up to 2 meters in height, featuring rough, hairy stems and large, yellow composite flower heads. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic, and slightly bitter root that is often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. Inula vulgaris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks."
