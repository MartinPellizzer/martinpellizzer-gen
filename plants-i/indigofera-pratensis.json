    "intro": "Indigofera pratensis, commonly known as field indigo, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its historical use in dye production has also contributed to its recognition in botanical studies."
