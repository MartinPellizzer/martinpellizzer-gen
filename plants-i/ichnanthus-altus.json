    "intro": "Ichnanthus altus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and its unique floral structure that resembles that of the true lily of the valley."
