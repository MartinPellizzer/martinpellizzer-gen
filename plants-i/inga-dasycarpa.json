    "intro": "Inga dasycarpa, commonly known as the \"sweet acacia,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of several oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Inga dasycarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agroforestry systems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful species for reforestation and land rehabilitation."
