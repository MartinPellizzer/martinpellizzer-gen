It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Indigofera vestita is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
