It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its low-growing habit and early blooming period make it a valuable addition to native plant collections. It is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
