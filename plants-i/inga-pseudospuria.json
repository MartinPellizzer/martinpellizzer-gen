    "intro": "Inga pseudospuria, commonly known as the Brazilian wisteria, is a woody legume native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its long, pendulous racemes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in secondary forests. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
