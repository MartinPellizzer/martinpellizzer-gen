    "intro": "Indigofera vicioides subsp. vicioides, commonly known as the slender indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and racemose inflorescences. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive red or purple calyx. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
