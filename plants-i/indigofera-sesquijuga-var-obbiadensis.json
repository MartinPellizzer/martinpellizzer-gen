    "intro": "Indigofera sesquijuga var. obbiadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre indigo, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drier, elevated environments. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles."
