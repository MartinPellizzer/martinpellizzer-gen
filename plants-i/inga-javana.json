    "intro": "Inga javana, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for agroforestry and reforestation projects. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
