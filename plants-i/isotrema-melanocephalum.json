    "intro": "Isotrema melanocephalum, commonly known as the black-headed isotrema, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by spherical, black berries, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
