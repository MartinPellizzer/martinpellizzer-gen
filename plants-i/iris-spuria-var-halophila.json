    "intro": "Iris spuria var. halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, showcasing its halophytic nature. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with three upright petals and three drooping sepals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize marshy areas effectively. The leaves are sword-shaped, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its salty environment."
