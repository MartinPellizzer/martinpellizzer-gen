    "intro": "Ilex gracilis, commonly known as the slender holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ilex gracilis typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
