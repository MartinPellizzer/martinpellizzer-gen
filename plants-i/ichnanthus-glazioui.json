    "intro": "Ichnanthus glazioui, commonly known as the Glaziou's twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its unique floral structure that resembles a twayblade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ichnanthus glazioui is considered a threatened species."
