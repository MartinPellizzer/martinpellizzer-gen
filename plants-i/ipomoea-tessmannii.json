    "intro": "Ipomoea tessmannii, commonly known as the tessmann's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, opening in the morning and closing by midday. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in native habitats."
