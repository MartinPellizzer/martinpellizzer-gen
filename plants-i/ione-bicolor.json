    "intro": "Ione bicolor, commonly known as the Sierra violet, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ione bicolor plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
