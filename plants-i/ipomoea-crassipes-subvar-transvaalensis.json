    "intro": "Ipomoea crassipes subvar. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal morning glory, is a tropical vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
