It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has bright green, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Iberis sabauda is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
