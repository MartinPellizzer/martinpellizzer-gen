    "intro": "Iris stenophylla subsp. margaretiae, commonly known as Margaret's narrow-leaved iris, is a rare and distinctive member of the Iridaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. This subspecies is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white throat. It thrives in high-altitude meadows and requires well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
