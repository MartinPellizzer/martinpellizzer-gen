It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees and other pollinators, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
