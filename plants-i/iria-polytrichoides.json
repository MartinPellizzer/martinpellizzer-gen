    "intro": "Iria polytrichoides, commonly known as the small haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, elongated leaf-like structures. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing capsules are typically borne on short, erect stalks, and the leaves are usually covered with tiny, hair-like structures. Iria polytrichoides plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
