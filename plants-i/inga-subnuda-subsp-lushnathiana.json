It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. It has a shallow root system and is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.
