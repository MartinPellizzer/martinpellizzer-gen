    "intro": "Ipomoea wightii, commonly known as the Wight's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
