    "intro": "Isolepis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other similar plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often dominating wetland ecosystems. Isolepis decipiens is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
