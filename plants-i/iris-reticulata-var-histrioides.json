    "intro": "Iris reticulata var. histrioides, commonly known as the Persian iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive reticulate pattern on the petals. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
