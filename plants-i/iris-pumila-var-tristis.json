    "intro": "Iris pumila var. tristis, commonly known as the weeping iris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern United States and Canada. It features delicate, nodding blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often carpeting the ground in woodland or wetland habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Its unique, drooping flower structure and evergreen foliage make it a distinctive addition to native gardens."
