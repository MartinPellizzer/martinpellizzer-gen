It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Itea japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
