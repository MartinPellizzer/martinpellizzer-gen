    "intro": "Ionopsis gardneri, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ionopsis gardneri is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
