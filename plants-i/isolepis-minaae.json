    "intro": "Isolepis minaae, commonly known as the African flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
