    "intro": "Ischaemum nodulosum var. glabriflorum, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, tufted stems that grow from a rhizomatous base, and its leaves are typically narrow and hairy. The inflorescence consists of loose, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. This plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
