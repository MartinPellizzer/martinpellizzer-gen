    "intro": "Icica cuspidata, commonly known as the toothed icica, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with sharp, tooth-like edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Icica cuspidata is considered a vulnerable species."
