    "intro": "Ionidium dahomensis var. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal ionidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
