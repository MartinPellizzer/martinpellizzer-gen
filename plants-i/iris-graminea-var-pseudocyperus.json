    "intro": "Iris graminea var. pseudocyperus, commonly known as the grass iris, is a striking plant characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and showy blue to purple flowers. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that form a dense rosette, while its flowering stems bear clusters of vibrant blooms. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ability to attract pollinators. The variety pseudocyperus is notable for its unique morphology, resembling that of a sedge more than a typical iris."
