    "intro": "Isoetes jarmaniae, commonly known as the Jarman's watermace, is a rare and ancient species of aquatic fern belonging to the genus Isoetes. It is characterized by its spiny, leathery leaves that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporangium-bearing leaves, which are often found near the water's surface. Isoetes jarmaniae is native to parts of Asia and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
