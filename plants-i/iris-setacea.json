    "intro": "Iris setacea, commonly known as the desert iris, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to store water efficiently. Iris setacea plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
