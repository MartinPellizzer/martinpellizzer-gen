It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its striking, often colorful foliage. Many species have leaves that display vivid red, purple, or blue hues, which are due to the presence of anthocyanins. The plants typically have small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale in color. Iresine is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
