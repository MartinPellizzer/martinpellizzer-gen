    "intro": "Inga recordii, commonly known as the Brazilian velvet tamarind, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, velvety leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for ecological restoration and agroforestry systems."
