    "intro": "Ischaemum diplopogon, commonly known as the two-ridge grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ischaemum diplopogon is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
