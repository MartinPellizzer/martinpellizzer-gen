    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. argentea-stricta, commonly known as the silver-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves. This plant is evergreen, featuring glossy, dark green upper surfaces with a contrasting white or silver hue on the underside. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters in suitable conditions. The leaves are lance-shaped and have spiny margins, typical of the Ilex genus. It produces small, red berries in the winter, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
