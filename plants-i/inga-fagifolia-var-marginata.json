    "intro": "Inga fagifolia var. marginata, commonly known as the marginated inga, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin, which sets it apart from other Inga species. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems and potential use in agroforestry."
