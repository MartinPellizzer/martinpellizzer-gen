    "intro": "Ichnanthus ruprechtii var. tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence, which gives it a woolly appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
