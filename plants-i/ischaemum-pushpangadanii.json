    "intro": "Ischaemum pushpangadanii, commonly known as the Pushpangadan's goatgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the Indian subcontinent and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, typically flowering during the summer months. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species within its native range."
