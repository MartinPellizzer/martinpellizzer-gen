    "intro": "Ibidium romanzoffianum, commonly known as the Zulu orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
