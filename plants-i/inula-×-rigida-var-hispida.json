The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
