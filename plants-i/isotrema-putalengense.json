    "intro": "Isotrema putalengense, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue to black berries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
