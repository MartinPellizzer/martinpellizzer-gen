    "intro": "Ida laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely serrated, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath, turning vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
