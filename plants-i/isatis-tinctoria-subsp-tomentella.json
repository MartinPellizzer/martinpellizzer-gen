    "intro": "Isatis tinctoria subsp. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly woad, is a variant of the woad plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces blue flowers, similar to its parent species, and is typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial, often growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. While less commonly cultivated for dye production than the standard woad, it is still valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance."
