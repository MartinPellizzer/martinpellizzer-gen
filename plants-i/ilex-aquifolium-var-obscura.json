    "intro": "Ilex aquifolium var. obscura, commonly known as the dark-leaved holly, is a variant of the common holly, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. It is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The leaves are typically narrower and darker in color compared to the standard variety, with a leathery texture. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows."
