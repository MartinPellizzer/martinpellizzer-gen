    "intro": "Viola orientalis f. laciniata, commonly known as the Persian violet or the split-leaved violet, is a cultivar of the viola genus native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring. It prefers cool, moist conditions and is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens. Its foliage and flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders."
