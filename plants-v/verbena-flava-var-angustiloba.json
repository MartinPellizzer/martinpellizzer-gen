It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
