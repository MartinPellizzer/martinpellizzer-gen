    "intro": "Vriesea boeghii, commonly known as the Boeghii's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, recurved bracts that display a range of colors, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central reservoir. It produces tall flower stalks with multiple inflorescences, each bearing small, white flowers. Vriesea boeghii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
