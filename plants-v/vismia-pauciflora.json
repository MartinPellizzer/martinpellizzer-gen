    "intro": "Vismia pauciflora, commonly known as the littleleaf sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant wood. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by small, round berries. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its aromatic timber. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
