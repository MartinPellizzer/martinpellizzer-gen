    "intro": "Viscum whitei, commonly known as the White's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into haustoria. It is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects. Its presence can also affect the growth and health of its host trees."
