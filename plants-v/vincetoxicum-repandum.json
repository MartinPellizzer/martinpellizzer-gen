    "intro": "Vincetoxicum repandum, commonly known as the creeping smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and livestock, containing cardiac glycosides. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value is limited due to its invasive potential in certain regions."
