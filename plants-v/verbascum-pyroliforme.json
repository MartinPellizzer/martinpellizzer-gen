    "intro": "Verbascum pyroliforme, commonly known as the pygmy mullein, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fuzzy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a loose, branching pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice in xeriscaping."
