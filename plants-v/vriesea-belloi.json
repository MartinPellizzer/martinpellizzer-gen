    "intro": "Vriesea belloi, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange and yellow. Vriesea belloi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
