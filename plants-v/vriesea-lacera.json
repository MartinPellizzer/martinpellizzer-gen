    "intro": "Vriesea lacera, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and vibrant, often colorful inflorescence. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. Its flowers, which can be red, orange, or yellow, bloom in late spring or early summer. Vriesea lacera is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments."
