It features slender,\u530d\u5310 (prostrate) stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Virectaria procumbens is valued in horticulture for its ability to form dense ground cover and its resilience in various soil conditions."
