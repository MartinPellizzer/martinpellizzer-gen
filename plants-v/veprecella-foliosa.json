    "intro": "Veprecella foliosa, commonly known as the leafy veprecella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
