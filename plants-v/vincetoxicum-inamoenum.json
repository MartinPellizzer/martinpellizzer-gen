    "intro": "Vincetoxicum inamoenum, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features striking, umbel-like clusters of white flowers that turn into bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in moist, shady woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive veining pattern. The species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal, though caution is necessary due to its poisonous nature."
