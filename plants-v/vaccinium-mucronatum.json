    "intro": "Vaccinium mucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Vaccinium mucronatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
