    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. caiana, commonly known as the Caiana grape, is a lesser-known variety within the Vitis vinifera species. It is characterized by its small, dark-colored berries and is primarily cultivated in specific regions of Italy. The plant exhibits typical viticultural features, including vigorous growth and a tendency to produce clusters of grapes. It is often used in regional wines, though its cultivation is limited due to its low yield and specific climatic requirements. The botanical structure of the Caiana grape includes thick, waxy skin, which contributes to its unique flavor profile."
