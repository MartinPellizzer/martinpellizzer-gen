    "intro": "Veratrum nigrum f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine white hellebore, is a variant of the white hellebore native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it survive in cold, mountainous environments. This subspecies is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil, making it a resilient and distinctive member of the Veratrum genus."
