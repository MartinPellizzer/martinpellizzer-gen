    "intro": "Viola brevistipulata f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent violet, is a variant of the short-stipuled violet. This perennial herbaceous plant is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves and stems, which give it its specific epithet. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive spurred petal at the back. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Violaceae family, valued for both its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
