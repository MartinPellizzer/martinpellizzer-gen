    "intro": "Vanilla helleri, commonly known as the sweet violets, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a sweet, fragrant aroma, which are often used in perfumery and as ornamental plants. Vanilla helleri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and commercial purposes."
