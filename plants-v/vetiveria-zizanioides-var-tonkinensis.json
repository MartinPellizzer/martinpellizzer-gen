    "intro": "Vetiveria zizanioides var. tonkinensis, commonly known as Tonkin vetiver, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
