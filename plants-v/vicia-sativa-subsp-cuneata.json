    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. cuneata, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, zigzagging stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and thrive in disturbed soils."
