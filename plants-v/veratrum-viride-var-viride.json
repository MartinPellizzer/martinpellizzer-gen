It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of pale green, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
