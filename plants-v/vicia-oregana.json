    "intro": "Vicia oregana, commonly known as the Oregon vetch, is a perennial legume native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system fixes nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Vicia oregana is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
