    "intro": "Vitex oligantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, narrow, ovate leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces fragrant, blue-violet flowers in panicles during the summer months, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. Vitex oligantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
