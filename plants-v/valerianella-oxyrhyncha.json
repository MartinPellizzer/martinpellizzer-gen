    "intro": "Valerianella oxyrhyncha, commonly known as mouse whiskers, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Valerianella oxyrhyncha is valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
