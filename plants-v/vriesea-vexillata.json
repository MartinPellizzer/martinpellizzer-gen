    "intro": "Vriesea vexillata, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a flame, with vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool. Its flowers bloom in a spiral pattern, often lasting several months. Vriesea vexillata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and moderate humidity."
