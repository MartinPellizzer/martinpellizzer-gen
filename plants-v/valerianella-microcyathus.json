    "intro": "Valerianella microcyathus, commonly known as the lesser valerian, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters and features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces tiny, pale pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on short, erect stems and are surrounded by small, cup-like structures called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Valerianaceae family. Valerianella microcyathus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
