It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries. Vaccinium hosei thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in local cuisine and traditional medicine."
