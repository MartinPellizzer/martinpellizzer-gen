    "intro": "Vrydagzynea albostriata, commonly known as the white-striped cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat. The distinctive white stripes on its trunk are a key identifying feature."
