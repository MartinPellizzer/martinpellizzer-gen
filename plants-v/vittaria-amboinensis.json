    "intro": "Vittaria amboinensis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure, often creating a protective layer over its substrate. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Vittaria amboinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
