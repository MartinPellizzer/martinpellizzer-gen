    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum var. salicinum, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to thrive in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are bell-shaped and typically pink or white, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is closely related to other Vaccinium species, such as the common blueberry, but differs in its ecological preferences and morphological characteristics."
