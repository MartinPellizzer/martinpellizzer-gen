    "intro": "Vriesea pittieri, commonly known as the \"Carnival Bromeliad,\" is a striking ornamental plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. Vriesea pittieri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental displays."
