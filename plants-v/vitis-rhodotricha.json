    "intro": "Vitis rhodotricha, commonly known as the red sandalwood grape, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, dark berries that ripen in the fall. The plant produces tendrils for climbing and has a woody stem that can become quite thick over time. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in partial shade."
