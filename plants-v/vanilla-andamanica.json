    "intro": "Vanilla andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the Andaman Islands. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by dark brown pods containing the vanilla beans. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a tropical climate for optimal growth. Its vanilla beans are used in culinary applications, though they are less common than those of vanilla planifolia. The species is valued for its unique aroma and is often cultivated for both ornamental and aromatic purposes."
