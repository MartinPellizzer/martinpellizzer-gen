    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 lemaitrei, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattellum, resulting in a plant with distinctive grey-green foliage and tall spikes of yellow flowers. The leaves are large, velvety, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
