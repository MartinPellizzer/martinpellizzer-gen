    "intro": "Vitellaria valenzuelana, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, oval fruits containing a nutritious seed kernel. The kernel is widely used in cosmetics, food, and traditional medicine due to its high fat content. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
