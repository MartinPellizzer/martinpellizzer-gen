    "intro": "Viguiera viridis, commonly known as green coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features basal rosettes of dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking yellow-orange composite flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera viridis is valued for its low maintenance and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
