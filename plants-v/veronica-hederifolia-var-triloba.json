    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia var. triloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in a trailing or mat-forming habit, making it suitable for ground cover in shady areas. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
