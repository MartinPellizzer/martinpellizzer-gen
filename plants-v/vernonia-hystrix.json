    "intro": "Vernonia hystrix, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, dark purple to brownish-red composite flowers. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Vernonia hystrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
