    "intro": "Verbena litoralis var. melanopotamica, commonly known as the black river verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom from late winter to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
