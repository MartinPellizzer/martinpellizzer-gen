    "intro": "Vachellia leucophloea, commonly known as the white-wood acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are deciduous during dry seasons. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that access groundwater. Vachellia leucophloea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
