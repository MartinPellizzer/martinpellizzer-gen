    "intro": "Verbascum lysiosepalum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Verbascum lysiosepalum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments."
