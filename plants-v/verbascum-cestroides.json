    "intro": "Verbascum cestroides, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs, which give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a cylindrical spike. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. Verbascum cestroides is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
