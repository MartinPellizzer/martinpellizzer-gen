    "intro": "Vicia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Vicia grandiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
