    "intro": "Vaccinium ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other species in the Vaccinium genus. The plant has oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or coastal areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
