    "intro": "Vanilla penicillata, commonly known as the golden vanilla, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into cylindrical pods, which contain the aromatic vanilla beans. These beans are harvested when mature and dried to develop their characteristic flavor and fragrance. Vanilla penicillata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its use in the production of vanilla extract."
