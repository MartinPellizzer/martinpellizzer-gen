    "intro": "Vernonia hyalina, commonly known as the glassy ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment. Vernonia hyalina is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
