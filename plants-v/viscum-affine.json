    "intro": "Viscum affine, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various trees and shrubs. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen, and its flowers are usually white or greenish-white. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Viscum affine is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia, and it plays an important ecological role in its habitat. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also providing shelter and food for wildlife."
