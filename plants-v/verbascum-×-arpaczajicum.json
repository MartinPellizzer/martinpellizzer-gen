    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 arpaczajicum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum phlomoides. It is a tall, herbaceous plant characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the Carpathian Mountains, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Its common name reflects its resemblance to the common mullein plant, with which it shares some botanical features."
