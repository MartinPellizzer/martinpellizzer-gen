    "intro": "Veronica scheereri, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Veronica scheereri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
