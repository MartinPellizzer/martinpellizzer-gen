It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has a slender, upright stem with several leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of the region's biodiversity."
