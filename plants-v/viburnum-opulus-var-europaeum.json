    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. europaeum, commonly known as European dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. The plant produces red, berry-like drupes that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and colorful autumn foliage."
