    "intro": "Verbascum pubescens, commonly known as the fuzzy mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Verbascum pubescens is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
