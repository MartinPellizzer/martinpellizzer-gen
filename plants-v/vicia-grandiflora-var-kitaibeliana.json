    "intro": "Vicia grandiflora var. kitaibeliana, commonly known as the large-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its robust, sprawling growth habit and its clusters of pea-like, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for ecological restoration."
