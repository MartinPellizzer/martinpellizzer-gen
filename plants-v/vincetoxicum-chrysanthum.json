    "intro": "Vincetoxicum chrysanthum, commonly known as the golden elderberry, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing various alkaloids. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though caution is advised due to its poisonous properties."
