    "intro": "Vicia lens var. tenorei, commonly known as the Tenore's lentil vetch, is a variant of the lentil vetch, characterized by its unique botanical features. It is a perennial legume native to specific regions of southern Europe, particularly Italy. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its pods contain lens-shaped seeds, which are similar to those of the common lentil but have distinct morphological characteristics. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
