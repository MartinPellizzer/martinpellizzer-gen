    "intro": "Vicia oreophila, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vicia oreophila thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
