It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum stachydiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
