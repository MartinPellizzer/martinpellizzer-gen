    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. craveiroia, commonly known as the Craveiroia grape, is a lesser-known variety of the Vitis vinifera species. It is characterized by its small, intensely flavored berries that are typically used in regional wines. The plant exhibits typical Vitis vinifera traits, including compound leaves and tendrils for climbing. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a period of winter dormancy. Due to its limited cultivation, little is known about its full botanical characteristics and genetic makeup."
