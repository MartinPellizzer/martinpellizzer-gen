    "intro": "Verbena intermedia var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
