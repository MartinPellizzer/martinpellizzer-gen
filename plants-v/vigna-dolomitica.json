    "intro": "Vigna dolomitica, commonly known as the dolomite bean, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. Vigna dolomitica is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and ecological resilience."
