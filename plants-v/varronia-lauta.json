    "intro": "Varronia lauta, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often leathery in texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly resistant to decay and used in construction and furniture. Varronia lauta also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
