    "intro": "Valeriana castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos' valerian, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a strong, pleasant scent, which is attributed to its essential oils. Valeriana castellanosii is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its potential medicinal properties."
