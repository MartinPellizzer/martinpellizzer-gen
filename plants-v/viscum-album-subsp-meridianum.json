    "intro": "Viscum album subsp. meridianum, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. This subspecies is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and parts of Southeast Asia."
