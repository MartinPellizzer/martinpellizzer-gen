    "intro": "Vernonia setososquamosa, commonly known as the hairy squamosa ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its rough, hairy stems and leaves covered in squamosal (scale-like) structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces yellow to orange flower heads, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Vernonia setososquamosa is often found in dry to mesic habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils."
