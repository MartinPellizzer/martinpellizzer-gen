    "intro": "Vaccinium inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are usually blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Vaccinium inconspicuum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and mountainous regions."
