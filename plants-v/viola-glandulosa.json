It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers with yellow markings. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial shade. Its stems are often glandular, which can contribute to its distinctive aroma. Viola glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
