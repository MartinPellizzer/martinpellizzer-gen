    "intro": "Velezia rigida var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the rigid velezia, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a woody shrub characterized by its rigid, often thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a branching pattern that allows it to thrive in dry, tropical conditions. It is often found in scrublands and dry forests, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
