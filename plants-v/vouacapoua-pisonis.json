    "intro": "Vouacapoua pisonis, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and broad, ovate leaves. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich coloration, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
