    "intro": "Vaccinium longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like cranberries and heathers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the colorful flowers. The fruit is a small, tart berry that ripens to a deep blue or purple color, often harvested in late summer."
