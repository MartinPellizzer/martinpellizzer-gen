It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often being larger and more showy. Viola trimestris prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
