    "intro": "Veronica punicea, commonly known as the fireweed or red veronica, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Veronica punicea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
