It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
