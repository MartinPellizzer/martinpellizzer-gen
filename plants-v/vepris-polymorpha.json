    "intro": "Vepris polymorpha, commonly known as the African wild lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces oval, sour-tasting fruits that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and fruits, contain compounds like limonene and citral, which contribute to its medicinal properties. Vepris polymorpha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
