    "intro": "Vilfa montana, commonly known as the mountain vilfa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or violet, blooming in late spring to early summer. Vilfa montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and alpine plant collections."
