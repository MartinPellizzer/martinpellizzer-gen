    "intro": "Vaccinium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, bright red berries in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in traditional Japanese cuisine. Vaccinium japonicum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
