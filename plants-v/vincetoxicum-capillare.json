    "intro": "Vincetoxicum capillare, commonly known as red baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiny, red berries that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and has palmately divided leaves with a glossy green surface. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. However, all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
