    "intro": "Vitis populifolia, commonly known as the poplar leaf grape, is a species of flowering vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the poplar tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. Vitis populifolia is often found growing along stream banks and in moist woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
