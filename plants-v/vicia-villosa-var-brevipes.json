    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. brevipes, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Vicia villosa var. brevipes thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climatic conditions."
