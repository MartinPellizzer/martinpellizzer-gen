    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 sterile, commonly known as the sterile mullein, is a hybrid plant in the genus Verbascum, which belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant typically produces showy yellow or orange flowers in the summer months, though it is noted for being sterile, meaning it does not produce viable seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
