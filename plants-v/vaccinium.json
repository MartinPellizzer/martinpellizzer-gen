    "intro": "Vaccinium, commonly known as blueberry, is a genus of over 450 species of evergreen shrubs in the family Ericaceae. These plants are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia. Vaccinium species are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers and their edible, berry-like fruits that range in color from white to deep blue. The plants prefer acidic soils and are often found in heathlands, bogs, and forest understories. They play an important role in ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity."
