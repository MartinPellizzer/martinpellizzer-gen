    "intro": "Vachellia mayana, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are feathery in appearance. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Vachellia mayana is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
