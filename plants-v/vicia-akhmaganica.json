    "intro": "Vicia akhmaganica, commonly known as the Akhmagan vetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are usually purple or pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
