    "intro": "Vanilla ramificans, commonly known as the climbing vanilla vine, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that climb using aerial roots and can reach lengths of several meters. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. Its most notable feature is the development of dark brown, wrinkled pods, which contain the aromatic vanilla beans used in flavoring. The botanical structure of Vanilla ramificans is adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
