    "intro": "Vitis luochengensis, commonly known as Luocheng grape, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its climbing vines and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that are typically dark blue to black in color. It is adapted to subtropical climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it holds significant value for botanical research and conservation efforts."
