    "intro": "Vicia sepium var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved hop-crop, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its ovate, broad leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in woodland edges. Vicia sepium var. ovata is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in agriculture."
