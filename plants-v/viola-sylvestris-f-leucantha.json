It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces pale lavender to white flowers with a distinctive violet center. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. The white variant of this species is notable for its reduced pigmentation compared to the typical violet flower color."
