    "intro": "Vanda \u00d7 geraldinoi, commonly known as the Geraldinoi Vanda, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and can reach up to 30 cm in length. Vanda \u00d7 geraldinoi is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
