    "intro": "Veronica elliptica, commonly known as narrowleaf speedwell, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Veronica elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes for its delicate appearance."
