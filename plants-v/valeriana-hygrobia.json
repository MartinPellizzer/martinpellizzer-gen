    "intro": "Valeriana hygrobia, commonly known as the moisture-loving valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist forested areas in the northeastern United States. It features upright, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on terminal spikes. Its root system is fibrous and develops a strong, aromatic scent, which is characteristic of the Valeriana genus. Valeriana hygrobia thrives in shaded, damp environments and is often found in woodland understories."
