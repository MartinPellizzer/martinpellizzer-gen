It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in panicles, typically in shades of white or pale purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are dry, woody capsules that split open to release small, smooth seeds. Vitex praetervisa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local medicine."
