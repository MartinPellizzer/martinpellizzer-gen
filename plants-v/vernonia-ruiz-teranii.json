It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow to orange-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Vernonia ruiz-teranii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
