    "intro": "Vriesea burle-marxii, commonly known as the Burle Marx Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it a dramatic focal point in gardens. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a lush, tropical appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is named after the Brazilian modernist architect Roberto Burle Marx, reflecting its bold and artistic visual appeal."
