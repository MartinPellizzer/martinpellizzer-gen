    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. mediifolia, commonly known as the intermediate leaf grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its distinct foliage, featuring leaves that are intermediate in size and shape between the typical Vitis vinifera varieties. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include tendrils for climbing and small, clustered flowers that develop into berries. While not widely cultivated for wine or table grapes, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and genetic diversity."
