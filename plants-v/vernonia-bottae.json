It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, violet to purple flower heads that resemble bottle brushes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Vernonia bottae thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
