    "intro": "Vaccinium pseudocaudatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries in the summer. These berries are often used in local cuisine and have a tart, acidic flavor. Vaccinium pseudocaudatum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in coniferous forest understories."
