    "intro": "Virotia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf virotia, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Virotia angustifolia is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
