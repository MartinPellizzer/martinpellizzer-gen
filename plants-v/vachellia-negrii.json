    "intro": "Vachellia negrii, commonly known as the Negri's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions. Vachellia negrii is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood in its native regions."
