It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
