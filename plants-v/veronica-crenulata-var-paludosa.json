    "intro": "Veronica crenulata var. paludosa, commonly known as the marsh speedwell, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ascending stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
