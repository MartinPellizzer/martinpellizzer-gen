    "intro": "Valerianella carinata, commonly known as garden sorrel, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Valerianella carinata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in gardens, meadows, and along roadsides. It is valued both for its culinary use in salads and as a medicinal herb for its potential health benefits."
