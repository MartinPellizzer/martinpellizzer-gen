    "intro": "Vincetoxicum lugardiae, commonly known as the African bittersweet, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Vincetoxicum lugardiae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxicity, but it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
