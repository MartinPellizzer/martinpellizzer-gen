    "intro": "Viscum trachycarpum var. douliotii, commonly known as the Douglas's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by spherical, fleshy berries that are orange to red in color. It is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its role in supporting bird populations through its nutritious berries. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological characteristics compared to other mistletoe species."
