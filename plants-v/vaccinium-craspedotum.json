    "intro": "Vaccinium craspedotum, commonly known as the narrowleaf huckleberry, is a species of shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue or black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The leaves are narrow and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
