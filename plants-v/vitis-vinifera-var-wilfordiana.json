    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. wilfordiana, commonly known as the Wilford's grape, is a rare and ancient variety of grapevine native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, dark berries and is often considered a wild relative of the common European grapevine. The plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it produces clusters of fruit that are prized for their unique flavor profile. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is of interest to botanists and viticulturists alike."
