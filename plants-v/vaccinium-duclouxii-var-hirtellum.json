    "intro": "Vaccinium duclouxii var. hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy trailing blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
