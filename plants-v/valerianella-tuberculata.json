    "intro": "Valerianella tuberculata, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Valerianella tuberculata is also known for its mild, peppery scent and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
