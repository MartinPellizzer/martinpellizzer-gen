    "intro": "Vittadinia multifida, commonly known as the starry everlasting or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a clustered inflorescence. Vittadinia multifida is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
