    "intro": "Vernonia rueppellii, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage that adds visual interest and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Vernonia rueppellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also a source of nectar for native pollinators."
