    "intro": "Vitellaria paradoxa, commonly known as shea tree or butter tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and large, elliptical leaves that are alternate and pinnately compound. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a nutritious seed kernel. The kernel is the source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and food. It plays an important ecological and economic role in the regions where it is found."
