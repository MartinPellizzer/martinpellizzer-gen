    "intro": "Virga inermis, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a tendency to curl at the edges. Virga inermis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants."
