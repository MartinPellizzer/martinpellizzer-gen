    "intro": "Veronica verna var. campestris, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in naturalized areas."
