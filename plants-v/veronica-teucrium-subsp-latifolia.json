    "intro": "Veronica teucrium subsp. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized landscapes."
