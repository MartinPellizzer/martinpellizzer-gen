    "intro": "Viscum compressum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees such as oak and elm. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and oval-shaped, and it flowers in late winter or early spring. Viscum compressum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
