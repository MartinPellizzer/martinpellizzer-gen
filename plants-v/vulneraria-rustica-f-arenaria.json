It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as coastal dunes and sandy soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds adapted for dispersal in dry conditions."
