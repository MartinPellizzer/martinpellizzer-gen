The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Vigna scabrida is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in arid conditions, making it a resilient crop in many parts of the world. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
