    "intro": "Vicia sativa f. immaculata, commonly known as the white vetch, is a cultivar of the common vetch, characterized by its striking white flowers and finely divided, trifoliate leaves. It is a herbaceous annual plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in temperate climates. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control. The white vetch is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, enriching the soil for subsequent plant growth."
