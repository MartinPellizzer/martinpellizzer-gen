    "intro": "Virola araujovii, commonly known as the Amazonian yellowwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the dense rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and large, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. Virola araujovii is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often found in primary forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
