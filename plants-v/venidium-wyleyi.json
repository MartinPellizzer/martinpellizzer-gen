    "intro": "Venidium wyleyi, commonly known as the African senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a\u835a\u679c (pod) that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Venidium wyleyi is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
