    "intro": "Vicia leucophaea, commonly known as the white vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. It has a trailing growth habit and produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Vicia leucophaea is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
