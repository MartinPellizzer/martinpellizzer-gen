    "intro": "Verbascum armenum, commonly known as Armenian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a terminal spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
