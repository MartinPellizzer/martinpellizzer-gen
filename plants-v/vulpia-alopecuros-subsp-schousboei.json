    "intro": "Vulpia alopecuros subsp. schousboei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved veld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable environments. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it resilient in harsh climates."
