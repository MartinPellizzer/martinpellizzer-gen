    "intro": "Vaccinium absconditum, commonly known as the hidden blueberry, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other berry-producing plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, making them difficult to spot. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, with a leathery texture adapted to cold and nutrient-poor environments. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
