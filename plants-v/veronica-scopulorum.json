    "intro": "Veronica scopulorum, commonly known as the rock speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often form dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Veronica scopulorum is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky crevices and scree slopes."
