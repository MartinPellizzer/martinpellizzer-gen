    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus subsp. gaetulum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, velvety gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its fluffy appearance, it is often used in ornamental gardening and traditional medicine."
