    "intro": "Vanda tricolor f. planilabris, commonly known as the flat-labellum vanda, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, tri-colored flowers that typically feature a combination of yellow, green, and red hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The flat, modified leaf-like structure of its labellum is a distinguishing feature of this cultivar."
