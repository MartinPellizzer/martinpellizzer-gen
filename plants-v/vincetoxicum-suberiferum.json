    "intro": "Vincetoxicum suberiferum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, soft white or grayish hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly rough texture. Vincetoxicum suberiferum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
