It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with long, drooping stems that support its foliage. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a glossy surface, which helps in capturing sunlight efficiently. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
