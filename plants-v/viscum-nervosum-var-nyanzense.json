    "intro": "Viscum nervosum var. nyanzense, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries that contain toxic compounds. The plant relies on its host for water and minerals but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects. Its presence can sometimes lead to the decline of host trees if infestations are severe."
