    "intro": "Vaccinium iteophyllum var. iteophyllum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in areas with high salinity and strong winds. The plant produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in local cuisine. Its leaves are evergreen, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are white and bell-shaped. This variety is well adapted to coastal environments and plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
