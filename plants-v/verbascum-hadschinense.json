    "intro": "Verbascum hadschinense, commonly known as the Hadschinen mullein, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are long and fuzzy, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Verbascum hadschinense is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
