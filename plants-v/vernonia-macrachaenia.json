    "intro": "Vernonia macrachaenia, commonly known as the large-headed ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its clusters of yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture, and its stems are covered in fine, stiff hairs. Vernonia macrachaenia is often found in dry, sandy soils in open woodlands and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
