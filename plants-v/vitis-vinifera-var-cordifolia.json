    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf grape, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its botanical name. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. Its berries are typically smaller than those of other Vitis vinifera varieties and have a more intense flavor. Due to its unique morphology and taste, it is occasionally used in specialty winemaking and ornamental horticulture."
