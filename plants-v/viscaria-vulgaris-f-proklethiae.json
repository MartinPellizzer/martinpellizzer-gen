    "intro": "Viscaria vulgaris f. proklethiae, commonly known as the Proklethia form of the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a horticultural variant of a low-growing, mat-forming plant. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from late winter to early summer. The leaves are hairy and ovate, with a distinctive rosette growth pattern that helps it thrive in cooler climates. This form is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile addition to many garden settings."
