    "intro": "Viburnum serratum, commonly known as the serrated viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum serratum is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also a host plant for several species of butterflies and moths."
