    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica var. savatieri, commonly known as the water speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-to-violet flowers with five petals, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in wetland environments."
