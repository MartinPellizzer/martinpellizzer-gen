    "intro": "Veronica vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic speedwell, is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its vibrant blue and purple flowers, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of volcanic landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat, Veronica vulcanica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
