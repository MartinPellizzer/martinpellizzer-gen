    "intro": "Viola canina subsp. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a hairy texture and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its subspecies characteristics include narrower leaves compared to the typical V. canina, and it is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
