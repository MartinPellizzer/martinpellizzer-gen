    "intro": "Vicia scheuzeri, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, and it has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets. Vicia scheuzeri is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
