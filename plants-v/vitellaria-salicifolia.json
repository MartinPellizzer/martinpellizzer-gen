    "intro": "Vitellaria salicifolia, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a fatty seed kernel. The kernel is the source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and cooking. It plays an important ecological and economic role in the regions where it is found."
