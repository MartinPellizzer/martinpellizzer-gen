    "intro": "Vriesea piepenbringii, commonly known as the Peppermint Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of multiple flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, and orange, which bloom in succession. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea piepenbringii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
