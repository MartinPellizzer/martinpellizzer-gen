    "intro": "Veronica brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Veronica brevifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
