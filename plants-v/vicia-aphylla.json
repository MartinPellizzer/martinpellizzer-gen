    "intro": "Vicia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and the absence of true leaves, instead bearing small, stipitate stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits. Vicia aphylla is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in scrublands and coastal areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
