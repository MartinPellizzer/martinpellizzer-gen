    "intro": "Vincetoxicum matsumurae, commonly known as the Japanese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of purple berries that appear in late summer and persist into winter. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland environments. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle the plant with care."
