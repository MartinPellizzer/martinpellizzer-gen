    "intro": "Vernonia integra, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Vernonia integra is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
