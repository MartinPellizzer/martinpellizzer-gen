    "intro": "Viscum cryptophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white berries that are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive pattern of veins. Viscum cryptophlebium is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species."
