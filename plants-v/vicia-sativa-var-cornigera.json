It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a forage crop for livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and sustainable farming practices."
