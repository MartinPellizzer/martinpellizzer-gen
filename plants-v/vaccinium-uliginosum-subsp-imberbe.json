    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum subsp. imberbe, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a shrub native to peat bogs and wetlands in northern regions. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant has elliptic, leathery leaves that are typically narrower than those of the main species. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
