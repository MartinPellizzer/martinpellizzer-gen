It features distinctive, spurred petals that give it its common name, with the upper petal shaped like a horn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky habitats, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in early spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, violet-colored blooms."
