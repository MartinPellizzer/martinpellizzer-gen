    "intro": "Viburnum plicatum f. rotundifolium, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a cultivar of the viburnum plant characterized by its unique, rounded leaves. It is native to Japan and is prized for its ornamental value, particularly its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in spring. The foliage is often a striking dark green, with a velvety texture that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. This plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardens. It also produces red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and add color to the landscape."
