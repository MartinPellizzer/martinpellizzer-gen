    "intro": "Verbena macdougalii f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower verbena, is a cultivar of the verbena genus native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant typically reaches a height of 12 to 18 inches and has slender, branching stems covered in fine, grayish-blue hairs. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green hue. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and borders due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
