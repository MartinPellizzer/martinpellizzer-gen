    "intro": "Verbascum schraderi, commonly known as Schrader's mullein, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes many species of mullein known for their medicinal and ornamental uses. Schrader's mullein thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are thick and covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores."
