    "intro": "Vriesea johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that curve inward, forming a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, sword-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea johnstonii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
