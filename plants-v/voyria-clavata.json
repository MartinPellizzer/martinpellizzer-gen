It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in dense, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Voyria clavata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
