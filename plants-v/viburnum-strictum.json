    "intro": "Viburnum strictum, commonly known as arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring dense, upright growth with dark green, ovate leaves that turn red or purple in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and compact form, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Viburnum strictum is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance to various soil conditions."
