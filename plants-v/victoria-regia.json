    "intro": "Victoria regia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three feet in diameter. The leaves are thick and buoyant, supported by a network of veins that help distribute weight and prevent them from sinking. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators like beetles. Victoria regia is renowned for its unique botanical features and ecological significance in its native habitat."
