    "intro": "Veronica thellungiana, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in early summer, adding a splash of color to its otherwise subdued foliage. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is popular in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
