    "intro": "Vriesea hydrophora, commonly known as the water vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, strap-like leaves that form a central rosette, capable of collecting and retaining water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea hydrophora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
