    "intro": "Viguieranthus densinervus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dense-veined orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, veined leaves and striking, fragrant orchid flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its hairy texture, particularly on the stems and leaves, is a distinguishing feature. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
