It is a compact, evergreen plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
