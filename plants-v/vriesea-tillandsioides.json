    "intro": "Vriesea tillandsioides, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant orange-red bracts and small white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Vriesea tillandsioides is prized for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
