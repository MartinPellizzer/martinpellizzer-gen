    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia subsp. maura, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained, sunny to partially shaded environments. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
