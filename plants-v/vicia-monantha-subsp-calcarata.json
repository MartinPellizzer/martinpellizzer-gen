    "intro": "Vicia monantha subsp. calcarata, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
