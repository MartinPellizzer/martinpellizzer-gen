    "intro": "Verbascum leianthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum leianthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
