    "intro": "Verbascum adenocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum adenocaulon is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
