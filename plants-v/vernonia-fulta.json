    "intro": "Vernonia fulta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Vernonia fulta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
