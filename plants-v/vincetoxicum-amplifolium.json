    "intro": "Vincetoxicum amplifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf periwinkle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, rounded seeds when mature. Vincetoxicum amplifolium is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
