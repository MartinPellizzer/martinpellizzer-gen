    "intro": "Viola orchidiflora, commonly known as the orchid-flowered violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers have a delicate, orchid-like appearance. Viola orchidiflora is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems."
