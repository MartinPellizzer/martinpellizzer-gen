    "intro": "Vanilla ovata, commonly known as the giant vanilla orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, ovate-shaped fruits that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a distinctive vanilla aroma, which is similar to the more commercially known vanilla planifolia. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong scent, attracting specific pollinators like the endemic bee *Eulaema meriana*. The plant is valued not only for its fragrance but also for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat."
