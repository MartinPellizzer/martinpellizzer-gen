The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to regrow from its rhizomes after grazing or fire. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
