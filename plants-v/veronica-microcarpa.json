    "intro": "Veronica microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
