    "intro": "Viola frigida var. borchersii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky habitats. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine environment. The plant is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
