    "intro": "Valerianella pumila var. rimosa, commonly known as the slender valerian, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has a distinctive, slightly aromatic foliage with finely divided leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for certain insects and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
