    "intro": "Verbena bryoides, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. Sand verbena is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
