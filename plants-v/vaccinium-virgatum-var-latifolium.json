    "intro": "Vaccinium virgatum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf blueberry, is a variant of the common blueberry native to the eastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in moist, forested areas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which develop into edible berries. Its leaves are broader and more elongated compared to the typical variety, contributing to its distinguishing appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its potential for cultivation in suitable climates."
