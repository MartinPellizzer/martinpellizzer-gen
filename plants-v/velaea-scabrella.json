    "intro": "Velaea scabrella, commonly known as roughleaf velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The plant features hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Velaea scabrella is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
