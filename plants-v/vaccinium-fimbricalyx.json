    "intro": "Vaccinium fimbricalyx, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other species in the Vaccinium genus. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, acidic environments near the coast. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated edge. The coastal blueberry is valued not only for its fruit but also for its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
