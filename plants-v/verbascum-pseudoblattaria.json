    "intro": "Verbascum pseudoblattaria, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
