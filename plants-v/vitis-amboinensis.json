    "intro": "Vitis amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboyna grape, is a climbing vine native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn dark purple when mature. Vitis amboinensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine. Its vines are often trained on trellises or other supports due to their vigorous growth habit."
