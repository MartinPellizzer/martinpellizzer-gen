    "intro": "Vernonanthura rubriramea, commonly known as the red-stemmed lily, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that display a distinctive reddish hue, particularly noticeable in the younger growth. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent yellow throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
