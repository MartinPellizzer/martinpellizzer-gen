It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green to reddish bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically surrounded by glandular hairs, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Vernonia glandulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
