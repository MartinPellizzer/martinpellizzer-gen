    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. helmeri, commonly known as the Helmer's vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
