    "intro": "Vulvaria trachisperma, commonly known as the rough-stemmed vetch, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Vulvaria trachisperma is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
