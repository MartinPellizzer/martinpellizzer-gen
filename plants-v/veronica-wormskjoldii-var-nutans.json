It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that droop downward, giving it its characteristic \"nodding\" appearance. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
