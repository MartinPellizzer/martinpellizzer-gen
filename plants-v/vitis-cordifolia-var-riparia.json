    "intro": "Vitis cordifolia var. riparia, commonly known as river grape or riparian grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are typically consumed by wildlife. It thrives in moist, riparian habitats and is often found along riverbanks and stream edges. Its flexible stems allow it to climb and spread along vegetation, making it a common sight in wetland environments."
