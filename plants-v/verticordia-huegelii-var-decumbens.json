    "intro": "Verticordia huegelii var. decumbens, commonly known as the Heath's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the family Ericaceae. It is native to the south-western region of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils with good drainage. The plant features slender, prostrate stems and produces clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers in shades of pink and yellow. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from land clearing, it is classified as endangered."
