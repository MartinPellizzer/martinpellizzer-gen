    "intro": "Velleia lyrata, commonly known as the lyreleaf velleia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Velleia lyrata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators make it a notable species in its native habitat."
