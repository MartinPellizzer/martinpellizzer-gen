    "intro": "Vernonia obovata var. chrysophylla, commonly known as goldenleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically obovate, meaning they are broad at the tip and narrow toward the base, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variety is notable for its striking foliage, which can display a yellowish or golden hue, especially in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats."
