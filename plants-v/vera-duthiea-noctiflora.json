    "intro": "Vera-duthiea noctiflora, commonly known as the night-blooming twilight flower, is a rare and exotic plant characterized by its striking, velvety petals that open only during the evening hours. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to the remote highlands of Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, green berries that mature into a deep red color, which contain the plant's seeds. Its unique blooming pattern and vivid coloration make it a subject of fascination for botanists and horticulturists alike. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
