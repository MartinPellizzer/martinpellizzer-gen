    "intro": "Verbascum varians, commonly known as the yellow mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, fuzzy gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal remedies for their mild laxative and anti-inflammatory properties. Verbascum varians thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for dry garden landscapes."
