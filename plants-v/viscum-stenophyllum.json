    "intro": "Viscum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to obtain additional energy. Viscum stenophyllum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
