    "intro": "Vitis diversifolia, commonly known as the diverseleaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of edible, sour-tasting berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Vitis diversifolia is adapted to moist, wooded areas and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
