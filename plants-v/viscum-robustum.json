    "intro": "Viscum robustum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of sticky, berry-like fruits. Its berries contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, which eat the fruit and excrete the seeds onto other host trees. Viscum robustum is often associated with holiday traditions and has cultural significance in various regions of Europe."
