    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. repens, commonly known as trailing blackberry, is a woody vine native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems that help it climb and spread across surfaces. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
