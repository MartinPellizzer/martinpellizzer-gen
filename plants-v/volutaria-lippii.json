    "intro": "Volutaria lippii, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a bright yellow to orange-green thallus that is often covered in small, rounded lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
