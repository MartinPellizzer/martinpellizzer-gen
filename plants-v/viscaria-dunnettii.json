    "intro": "Viscaria dunnettii, commonly known as the coastal carnation, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant is well adapted to salty, windy conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss. Viscaria dunnettii is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
