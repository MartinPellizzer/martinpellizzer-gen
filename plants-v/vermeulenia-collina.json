    "intro": "Vermeulenia collina, commonly known as the mountain vermeulenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
