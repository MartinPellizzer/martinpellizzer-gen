    "intro": "Vanilla palmarum var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant vanilla or large-leaf vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific species of bees. Its vanilla pods, which develop after successful pollination, are smaller and less aromatic compared to those of the more commercially cultivated vanilla planifolia. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often grown in shaded, humid environments."
