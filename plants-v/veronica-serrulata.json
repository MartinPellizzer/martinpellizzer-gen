    "intro": "Veronica serrulata, commonly known as the saw-toothed speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers clustered in whorls along the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, contributing to its common name. Veronica serrulata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
