    "intro": "Vrydagzynea neohibernica, commonly known as the Hibernian ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the misty highlands of Scotland. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded, calcareous soils among ancient woodlands. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale, almost ghostly hue, giving it its ethereal appearance. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its limited propagation. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
