    "intro": "Vernonia pleiotaxoides, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Vernonia pleiotaxoides is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important species in arid and semi-arid regions. Its wood is dense and strong, historically used for construction and tool-making by local communities."
