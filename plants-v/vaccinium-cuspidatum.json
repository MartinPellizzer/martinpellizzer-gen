    "intro": "Vaccinium cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often forming dense thickets. Its small, leathery leaves are dark green and oval in shape, and it produces edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
