It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Vierlingia is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps."
