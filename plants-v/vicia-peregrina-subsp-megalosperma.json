It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a deep green color. The plant produces elongated, pale green pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
