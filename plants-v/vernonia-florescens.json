    "intro": "Vernonia florescens, commonly known as the golden ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of yellow to golden-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Vernonia florescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
