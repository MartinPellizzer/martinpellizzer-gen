    "intro": "Viola grypoceras f. hemileuca, commonly known as the pale violet, is a botanical variant characterized by its distinctive pale lavender to almost white flowers. This form exhibits a reduced pigmentation compared to typical viola species, giving it a more subdued appearance. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in woodland areas and shaded gardens, where it can flourish without direct sunlight. Botanically, it is considered a fascinating example of varietal variation within the Viola genus."
