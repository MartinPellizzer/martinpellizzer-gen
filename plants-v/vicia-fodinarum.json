It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source for birds and small mammals. Vicia fodinarum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
