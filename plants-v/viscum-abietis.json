    "intro": "Viscum abietis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of deciduous and coniferous trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through its stems. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. Viscum abietis has a symbiotic relationship with its host, often causing no immediate harm but potentially affecting the tree's growth over time. It is widely distributed across Europe and parts of North Africa."
