    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. anamensis, commonly known as the Anamensis grape, is a lesser-known variety originating from the Anam region in Vietnam. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and is primarily cultivated for its unique flavor profile rather than commercial wine production. The plant exhibits typical Vitis vinifera traits, including compound leaves and tendrils for climbing. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and viticulturists."
