It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant is known for its small, edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color. Vitis barteri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
