    "intro": "Verbascum lagurus subsp. ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic mullein, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, bract-like structures. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the genus Verbascum, known for their medicinal and ornamental value."
