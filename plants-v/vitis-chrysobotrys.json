    "intro": "Vitis chrysobotrys, commonly known as the golden grape vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that transition into clusters of yellow to orange berries. These berries are edible but often have a tart, musky flavor. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative vine."
