It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are dry or rocky. This subspecies is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas."
