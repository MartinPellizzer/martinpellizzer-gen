It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its slender, erect stems that bear small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. This subspecies is noted for its ecological value, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
