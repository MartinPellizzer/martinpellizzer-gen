    "intro": "Viscago wolgensis, commonly known as the Wolgen's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on the branches of specific host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that anchor it to its host and absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are typically consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a smooth surface and a waxy coating. Viscago wolgensis is often found in temperate forest ecosystems, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
