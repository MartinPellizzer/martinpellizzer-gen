    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. pubinerve, commonly known as the hairy arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a hairy texture, especially along the veins. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Viburnum opulus var. pubinerve is relatively hardy and thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil."
