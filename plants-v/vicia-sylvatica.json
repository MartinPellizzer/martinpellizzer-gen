    "intro": "Vicia sylvatica, commonly known as the wood vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in woodland and hedgerow habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its pods contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Vicia sylvatica plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting ecological biodiversity."
