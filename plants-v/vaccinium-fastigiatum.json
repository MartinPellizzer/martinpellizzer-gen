    "intro": "Vaccinium fastigiatum, commonly known as the purple highbush blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence. The plant bears clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright blue berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Vaccinium fastigiatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential as a cultivated fruit crop."
