    "intro": "Verbesina petrobioides, commonly known as the rock coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often woody at the base. Verbesina petrobioides is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
