It features slender, erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, followed by small, lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
