    "intro": "Vernonanthura viscidula, commonly known as the sticky vernonberry, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are often covered in a sticky substance, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in montane forests and shrublands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
