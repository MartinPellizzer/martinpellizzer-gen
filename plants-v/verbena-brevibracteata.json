It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are often mistaken for flowers, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Verbena brevibracteata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
