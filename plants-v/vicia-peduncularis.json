It features trifoliate leaves with a small, stipitate leaflet, and its flowers are typically yellow or violet, arranged in racemes. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts.
