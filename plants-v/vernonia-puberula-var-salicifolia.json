It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage and inflorescences are often used in ornamental gardening for their subtle aesthetic appeal. The species is adapted to moist to wet soil conditions, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks."
