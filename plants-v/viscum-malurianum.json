    "intro": "Viscum malurianum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into leaf-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by birds that consume the berries. Viscum malurianum plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
