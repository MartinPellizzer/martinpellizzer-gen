    "intro": "Vatairea sericea, commonly known as silky vatairea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by flat, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Vatairea sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
