    "intro": "Vincetoxicum vincetoxicum, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans and livestock but serve as a food source for certain birds and wildlife. Vincetoxicum vincetoxicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and showy flowers."
