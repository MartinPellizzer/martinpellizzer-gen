    "intro": "Vernonia bullulata, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Vernonia bullulata is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in desert and chaparral ecosystems."
