    "intro": "Vicia alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged along a central axis. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in racemes. Vicia alternifolia is native to Europe and western Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and adaptability to various soil conditions."
