    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 zizii, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is a hybrid between Verbascum blattaria (common mullein) and Verbascum zizanioides (woolly mullein), resulting in a plant with distinctive gray-green foliage and tall, sparsely hairy stems. The leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stems. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
