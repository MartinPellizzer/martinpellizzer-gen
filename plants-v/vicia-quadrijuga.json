    "intro": "Vicia quadrijuga, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, followed by pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Vicia quadrijuga is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
