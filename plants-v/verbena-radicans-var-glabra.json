    "intro": "Verbena radicans var. glabra, commonly known as smooth trailing verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features sprawling, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Its small, clustered flowers are typically blue to purple, blooming in summer and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
