    "intro": "Viola pseudasterias var. psammophila, commonly known as the sand viol, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
