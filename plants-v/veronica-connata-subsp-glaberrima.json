It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy but can be smooth in this subspecies. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spike-like clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
