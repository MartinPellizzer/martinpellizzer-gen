    "intro": "Veronica repens var. cyanea, commonly known as the blue speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
