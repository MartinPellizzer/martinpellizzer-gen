    "intro": "Vincetoxicum badium var. badium, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three leaflets, each typically lobed and toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries, while poisonous, serve as a food source for certain wildlife species."
