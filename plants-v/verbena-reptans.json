    "intro": "Verbena reptans, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Verbena reptans is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
