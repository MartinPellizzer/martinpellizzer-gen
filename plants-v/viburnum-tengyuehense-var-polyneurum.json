It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched growth habit and dark green, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
