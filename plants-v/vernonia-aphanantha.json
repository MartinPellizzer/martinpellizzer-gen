    "intro": "Vernonia aphanantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its botanical name reflects its delicate, thread-like appearance, with \"aphanantha\" referring to its nearly invisible, slender flowers. Vernonia aphanantha is often found in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to floodplain environments."
