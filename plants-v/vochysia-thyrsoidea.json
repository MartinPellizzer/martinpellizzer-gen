    "intro": "Vochysia thyrsoidea, commonly known as the pink chuchuhuasi, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal."
