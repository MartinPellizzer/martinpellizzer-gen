    "intro": "Verbesina conyzoides, commonly known as beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, bristly seeds that can adhere to clothing and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
