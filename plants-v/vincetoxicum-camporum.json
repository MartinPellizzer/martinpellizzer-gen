It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, fragrant, purple-pink bracts that surround small, yellow flowers, creating a striking visual display in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, rich soils along stream banks. Vincetoxicum camporum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
