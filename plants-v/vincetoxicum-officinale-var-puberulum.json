    "intro": "Vincetoxicum officinale var. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy woodbine, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red and toxic, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, where it climbs using its tendrils."
