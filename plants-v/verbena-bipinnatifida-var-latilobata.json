    "intro": "Verbena bipinnatifida var. latilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and vibrant clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, lance-shaped lobes, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
