    "intro": "Viola biflora subsp. avatschensis, commonly known as the Avatschen violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its distinctive two-flowered inflorescence, which is a notable feature distinguishing it from other viola species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and the flowers are usually purple or violet in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
