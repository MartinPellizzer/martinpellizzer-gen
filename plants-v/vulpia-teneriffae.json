    "intro": "Vulpia teneriffae, commonly known as the Canary Island vulpia, is a grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing annual plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across the island's arid environments. Vulpia teneriffae plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's climate."
