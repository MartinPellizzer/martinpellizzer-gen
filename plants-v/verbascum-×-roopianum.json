    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 roopianum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes several species of flowering plants known for their fuzzy, woolly leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The hybrid nature of Verbascum \u00d7 roopianum results from crossbreeding between different species within the genus."
