    "intro": "Vriesea attenuata, commonly known as the sword fern bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea attenuata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
