    "intro": "Vriesea jonesiana, commonly known as the Jones' Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea jonesiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
