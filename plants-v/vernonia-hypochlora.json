    "intro": "Vernonia hypochlora, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery or grayish underside, contributing to its ornamental value. The small yellow flowers appear in late summer and are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules that aid in wind pollination."
