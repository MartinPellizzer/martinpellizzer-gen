    "intro": "Viburnum pubinerve f. lutescens, commonly known as the golden-hairy viburnum, is a compact shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are hairy on both sides, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and seasonal fruit display."
