    "intro": "Vesicaria deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while the stems are usually floating or partially submerged. Vesicaria deltoidea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and invertebrates."
