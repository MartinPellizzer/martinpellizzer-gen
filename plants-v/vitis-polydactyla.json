    "intro": "Vitis polydactyla, commonly known as the grapevines of the Canary Islands, is a climbing vine native to the subtropical regions of the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with multiple leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clustered berries. Its berries are typically small and edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other grape species. Vitis polydactyla is adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of its native habitat."
