    "intro": "Verbascum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, velvety grayish-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy yellow flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered with the same soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum pyrenaicum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
