    "intro": "Vicia notata, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia notata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
