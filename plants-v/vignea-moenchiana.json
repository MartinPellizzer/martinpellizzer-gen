    "intro": "Vignea moenchiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Vignea moenchiana is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution across various regions."
