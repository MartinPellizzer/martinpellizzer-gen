    "intro": "Vernonia buchananii, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellow to brownish-red flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its fibrous roots and woody stems make it drought-resistant, adapting well to arid environments. Vernonia buchananii is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
