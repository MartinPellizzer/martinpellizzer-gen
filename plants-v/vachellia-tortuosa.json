    "intro": "Vachellia tortuosa, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Vachellia tortuosa plays an important role in local ecosystems and is used by both wildlife and humans for its timber and medicinal properties."
