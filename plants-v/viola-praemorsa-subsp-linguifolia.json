    "intro": "Viola praemorsa subsp. linguifolia, commonly known as the purple violets, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a hairy texture and produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive violet throat. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals, and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more elongated leaf shape compared to other viola species."
