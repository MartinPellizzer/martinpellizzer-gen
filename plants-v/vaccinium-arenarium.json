    "intro": "Vaccinium arenarium, commonly known as sand cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in tundra and mountainous areas. The plant produces small, acidic berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are needle-like and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its hardy nature. Vaccinium arenarium plays a key role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
