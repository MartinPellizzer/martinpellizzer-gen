    "intro": "Vernonia alticola, commonly known as the mountain ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
