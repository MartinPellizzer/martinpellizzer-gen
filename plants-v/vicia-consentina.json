    "intro": "Vicia consentina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vicia consentina is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are encased in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
