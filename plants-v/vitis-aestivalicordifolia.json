    "intro": "Vitis aestivalicordifolia, commonly known as the summer heartleaf grape, is a lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically large and lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its fruits are small, round grapes that ripen in late summer, and they are often used in local winemaking traditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
