    "intro": "Veronica bihariensis, commonly known as the Himalayan speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Veronica bihariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
