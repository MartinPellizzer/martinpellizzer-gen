It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are violet-blue in color, with five petals and a distinctive spur that extends downward. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
