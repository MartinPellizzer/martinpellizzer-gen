It is characterized by its enormous, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The leaves are supported by long, flexible petioles that allow them to float on the water's surface. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming at night. This plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
