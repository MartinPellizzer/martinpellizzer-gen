    "intro": "Vicia unijuga var. kausanensis, commonly known as the Kausanensian vetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
