It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
