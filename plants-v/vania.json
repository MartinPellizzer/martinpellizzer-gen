    "intro": "Vania, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. Its botanical name is *Vanilla planifolia*, and it belongs to the Orchidaceae family. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into the familiar dark brown pods used in flavoring. The vanilla bean, or pod, is the fruit of the plant and contains the aromatic compounds responsible for its distinctive scent. Cultivation requires specific conditions, including warm temperatures and high humidity, to ensure proper development of the pods."
