    "intro": "Veronica carnea, commonly known as common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom from spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Veronica carnea is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and its ease of propagation through seeds or cuttings."
