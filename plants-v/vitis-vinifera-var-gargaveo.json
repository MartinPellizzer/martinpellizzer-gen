    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. gargaveo, commonly known as the Gargaveo grape, is a less commonly cultivated variety within the Vitis vinifera species. It is characterized by its small, dark-colored berries and a distinct, complex flavor profile that includes notes of spice and earth. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, showing moderate resistance to common vine diseases. Its foliage is medium-sized with a slightly serrated leaf margin, and it produces clusters of grapes that ripen in late summer. While not widely used in commercial winemaking, it is appreciated by enthusiasts for its unique aromatic qualities."
