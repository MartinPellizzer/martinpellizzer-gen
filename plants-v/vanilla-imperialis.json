    "intro": "Vanilla imperialis, commonly known as the imperial vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated green pods that mature into dark brown, fragrant vanilla beans. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, requiring support structures for its vigorous growth. Its flowers are small and white, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators. The vanilla pods are harvested and processed to extract the essential aromatic compounds used in flavoring and perfumery."
