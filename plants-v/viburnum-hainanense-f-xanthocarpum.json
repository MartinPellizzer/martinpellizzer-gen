    "intro": "Viburnum hainanense f. xanthocarpum, commonly known as the golden-fruited hainan viburnum, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern China. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow fruits, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and features clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. Its unique fruit coloration makes it a desirable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and horticultural study."
