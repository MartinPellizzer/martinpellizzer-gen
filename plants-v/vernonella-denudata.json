    "intro": "Vernonella denudata, commonly known as the naked stem vervain, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and open woodlands. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, and the stems are hairless, giving it its common name. Vernonella denudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
