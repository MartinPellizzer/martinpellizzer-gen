    "intro": "Vanillosmopsis erythropappa, commonly known as the red-leafed vanilla tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in color as they mature. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers followed by edible, orange-red berries that contain a single seed. Its unique aroma and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation. However, it is not commonly used for vanilla extraction, despite its name."
