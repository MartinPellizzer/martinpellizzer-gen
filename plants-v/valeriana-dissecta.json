    "intro": "Valeriana dissecta, commonly known as the dissected valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has finely dissected leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it thrives in rocky or dry soils. Valeriana dissecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Its essential oils are believed to have calming properties, though it is less commonly used than other valerian species."
