    "intro": "Veratrum caudatum, commonly known as the western white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often adorned with white to greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and have a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant contains toxic alkaloids and has been used historically in traditional medicine, though it is not recommended for modern use due to its potent effects."
