It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces fragrant, vanilla-like pods that are used in perfumery and flavoring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
