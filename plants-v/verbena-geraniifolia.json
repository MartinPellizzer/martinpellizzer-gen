    "intro": "Verbena geraniifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, vividly blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often described as having a delicate, fern-like appearance, which adds texture to garden landscapes. Verbena geraniifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
