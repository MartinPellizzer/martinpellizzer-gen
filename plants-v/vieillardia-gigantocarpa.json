It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest leafy plants in the world. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated calyx. The tree produces woody pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
