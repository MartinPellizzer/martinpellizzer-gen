    "intro": "Veronica serpylloides, commonly known as the mouse ear verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Veronica serpylloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
