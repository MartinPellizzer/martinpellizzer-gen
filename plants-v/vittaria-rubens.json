    "intro": "Vittaria rubens, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that form a dense, carpet-like structure on tree trunks or branches. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity for optimal growth. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Vittaria rubens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care."
