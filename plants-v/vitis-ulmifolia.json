    "intro": "Vitis ulmifolia, commonly known as the river grape or swamp grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of the elm tree, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color in the fall. Vitis ulmifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and swamps. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological botany."
