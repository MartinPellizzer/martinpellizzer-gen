    "intro": "Vigna glabrescens, commonly known as the African snout bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, narrow pods containing edible seeds. Vigna glabrescens is adapted to grow in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
