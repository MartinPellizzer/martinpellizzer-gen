    "intro": "Veronica laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are finely toothed or lobed, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. Veronica laciniata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
