    "intro": "Vittaria caricina, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, forming dense, compact clusters. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to surfaces while absorbing moisture from the air. Vittaria caricina is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
