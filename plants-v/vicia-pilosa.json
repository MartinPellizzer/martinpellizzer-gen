    "intro": "Vicia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Vicia pilosa is often found in disturbed soils and is used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in various regions across Europe and North America."
