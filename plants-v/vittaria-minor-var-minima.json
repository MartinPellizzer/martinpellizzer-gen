    "intro": "Vittaria minor var. minima, commonly known as the small vittaria, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria minor var. minima is often found in rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
