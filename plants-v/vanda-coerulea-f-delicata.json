    "intro": "Vanda coerulea f. delicata, commonly known as the blue vanda or blue orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are often adorned with intricate white and purple markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid climates with bright, indirect light. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green in color."
