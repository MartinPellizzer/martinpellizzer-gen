    "intro": "Veronica crispa, commonly known as the bent grass-vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy appearance. Veronica crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
