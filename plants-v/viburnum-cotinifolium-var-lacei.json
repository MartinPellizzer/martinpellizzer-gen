    "intro": "Viburnum cotinifolium var. lacei, commonly known as laceleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lace-like foliage that turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique leaf structure and seasonal color changes."
