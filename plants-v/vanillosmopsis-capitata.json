    "intro": "Vanillosmopsis capitata, commonly known as the sweet-scented sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense heads, which are often fragrant. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Vanillosmopsis capitata is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
