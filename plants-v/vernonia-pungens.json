    "intro": "Vernonia pungens, commonly known as the spiked ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, purple to brown flowers. The plant produces bracts that are often mistaken for leaves, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Vernonia pungens is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats. It also attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its abundant nectar-rich blooms."
