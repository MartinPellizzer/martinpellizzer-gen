    "intro": "Verticordia pectinata, commonly known as the yellow spraddie, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and have a distinctive, spurred shape, which is a hallmark of the Verticordia genus. This species is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
