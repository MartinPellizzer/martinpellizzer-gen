    "intro": "Vanda coerulea var. hennisiana, commonly known as the blue vanda, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue and violet flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its beauty in horticultural settings."
