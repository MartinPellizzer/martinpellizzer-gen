    "intro": "Vouacapoua aubletii, commonly known as the \"Amazonian rosewood,\" is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered and protected in many regions."
