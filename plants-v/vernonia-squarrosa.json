The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Vernonia squarrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
