    "intro": "Viola emirnensis, commonly known as the Emiran violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms in spring, producing clusters of small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola emirnensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
