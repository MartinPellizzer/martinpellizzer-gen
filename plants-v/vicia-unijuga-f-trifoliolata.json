    "intro": "Vicia unijuga f. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its trifoliate leaves. This plant is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Its botanical features make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
