    "intro": "Vernonia infundibularis, commonly known as the conebush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, cone-shaped seed heads that are often mistaken for flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
