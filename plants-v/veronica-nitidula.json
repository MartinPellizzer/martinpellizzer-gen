    "intro": "Veronica nitidula, commonly known as the glossy speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. Its flowers are small, blue to purple in color, and are clustered in loose, spike-like inflorescences. Veronica nitidula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks."
