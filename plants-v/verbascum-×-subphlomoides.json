    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 subphlomoides, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a hybrid between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum subphlomoides, resulting in a plant with distinctive fuzzy, velvety leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces tall, upright stems with showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. This plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
