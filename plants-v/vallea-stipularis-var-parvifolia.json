    "intro": "Vallea stipularis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vallea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in natural habitats."
