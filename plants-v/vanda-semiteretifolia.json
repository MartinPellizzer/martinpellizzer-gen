    "intro": "Vanda semiteretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vanda, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it capture moisture from the air. Vanda semiteretifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
