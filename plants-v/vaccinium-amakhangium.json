    "intro": "Vaccinium amakhangium, commonly known as the Amakhangium blueberry, is a shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue or black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
