    "intro": "Vicia scandens, commonly known as the climbing vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a vigorous climbing habit, often using its tendrils to ascend supports such as fences or trellises. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural settings. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
