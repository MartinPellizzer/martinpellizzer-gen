    "intro": "Vicia latibracteolata, commonly known as the broad-bract vetch, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Vicia latibracteolata is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or disturbed soils. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
