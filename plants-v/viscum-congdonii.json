    "intro": "Viscum congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating bird-dispersed propagation. Its leaves are often thick and leathery, and it may have a symbiotic relationship with certain insects. Viscum congdonii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
