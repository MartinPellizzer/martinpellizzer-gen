    "intro": "Volkameria infortunata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical features include a woody stem and hairy foliage, which help it conserve water in dry environments. Volkameria infortunata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh, desert-like conditions."
