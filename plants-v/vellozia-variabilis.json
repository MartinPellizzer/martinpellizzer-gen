It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. Vellozia variabilis is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
