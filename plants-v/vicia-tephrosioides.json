    "intro": "Vicia tephrosioides, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Vicia tephrosioides is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
