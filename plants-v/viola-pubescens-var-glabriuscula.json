It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The plant produces violet flowers with purple petals and a distinctive yellow throat, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
