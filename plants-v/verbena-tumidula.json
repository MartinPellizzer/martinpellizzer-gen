It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Verbena tumidula is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
