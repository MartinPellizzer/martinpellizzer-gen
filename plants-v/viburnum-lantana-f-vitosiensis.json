It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that provide ornamental value throughout the growing season. It is typically grown in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9, preferring partial to full sun and well-drained soil. Its compact form and seasonal interest make it a suitable choice for small gardens or as a specimen plant."
