    "intro": "Vieusseuxia viscaria, commonly known as the sticky vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that can adhere to surfaces using small, sticky pads. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Vieusseuxia viscaria is valued in horticulture for its ability to cover trellises and walls with its rapid growth and ornamental foliage."
