    "intro": "Vaccinium agusanense, commonly known as the Agusan huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and cranberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that transition into edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
