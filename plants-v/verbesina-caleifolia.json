    "intro": "Verbesina caleifolia, commonly known as the winter crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and vibrant yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, elongated fruits called achenes, which are typically surrounded by pappus hairs for wind dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Verbesina caleifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
