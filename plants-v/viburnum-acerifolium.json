    "intro": "Viburnum acerifolium, commonly known as maple-leaved viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that resemble maple leaves, with opposite arrangement and serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its growth habit is typically upright and bushy, reaching heights of 6 to 10 feet. Viburnum acerifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
