    "intro": "Viburnum longifolium, commonly known as the green anise viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flower clusters and attractive foliage. Viburnum longifolium is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
