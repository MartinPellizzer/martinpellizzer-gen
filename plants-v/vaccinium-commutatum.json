    "intro": "Vaccinium commutatum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acid-loving plants like heathers and huckleberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture, adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. Vaccinium commutatum is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions where it forms dense, ground-covering thickets."
