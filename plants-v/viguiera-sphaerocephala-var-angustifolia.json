It features silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant produces showy, globe-shaped flower heads in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
