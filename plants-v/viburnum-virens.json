    "intro": "Viburnum virens, commonly known as the evergreen viburnum, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that remains vibrant throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. Viburnum virens thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens."
