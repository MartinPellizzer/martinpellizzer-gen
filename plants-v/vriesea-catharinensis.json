    "intro": "Vriesea catharinensis, commonly known as the Catarinensis Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with colorful, long-lasting flowers in shades of orange and red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea catharinensis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
