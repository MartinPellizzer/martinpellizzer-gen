    "intro": "Vanda tricolor var. planilabris, commonly known as the flat-labied vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, tricolor flowers with a distinctive flat lip, which is a key identifying characteristic. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. This orchid thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
