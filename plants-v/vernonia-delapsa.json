    "intro": "Vernonia delapsa, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads that resemble mist. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Vernonia delapsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
