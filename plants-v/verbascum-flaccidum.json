    "intro": "Verbascum flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-green leaves and tall spikes of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. Verbascum flaccidum is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat respiratory ailments."
