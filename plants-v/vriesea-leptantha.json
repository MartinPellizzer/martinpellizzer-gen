    "intro": "Vriesea leptantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming foliage. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from orange to red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea leptantha is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
