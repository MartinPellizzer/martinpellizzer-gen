    "intro": "Verbena trifida var. deserticola, commonly known as desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
