    "intro": "Vanilla paulista, commonly known as Brazilian vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and produces fragrant, greenish-yellow orchid flowers. The plant's most notable feature is its vanilla pod, which develops after pollination by a specific bee species. The pods are harvested when they turn dark brown and are then cured and dried to develop their characteristic aroma. This species is valued for its use in culinary and aromatic applications."
