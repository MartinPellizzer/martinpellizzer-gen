    "intro": "Viola beckiana, commonly known as the Beck's violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant produces showy violet-blue flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, giving them a soft texture. Viola beckiana is often found growing in rich, loamy soil and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
