    "intro": "Viscum loranthicola, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by bright red berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Viscum loranthicola relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through nitrogen fixation. Its ecological role is significant in supporting bird populations that consume its berries."
