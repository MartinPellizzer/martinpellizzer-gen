    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys var. micrantha, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has a mat-forming habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas."
