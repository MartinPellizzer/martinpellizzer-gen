    "intro": "Vernonia tournefortioides, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in disturbed or sandy environments. Vernonia tournefortioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
