    "intro": "Vigna diffusa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to warm temperate regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Vigna diffusa is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates."
