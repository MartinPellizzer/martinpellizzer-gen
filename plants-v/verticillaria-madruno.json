    "intro": "Verticillaria madruno, commonly known as the Madruno's wheelplant, is a rare and fascinating member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence that resembles a wheel, composed of numerous small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in specific regions of southern Europe. Its leaves are deeply lobed and form a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
