    "intro": "Vicia communis var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with obovate leaflets, which are broad and rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
