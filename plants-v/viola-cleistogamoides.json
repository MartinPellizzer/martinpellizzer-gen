    "intro": "Viola cleistogamoides, commonly known as the cleistogamous violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinating and often remain hidden within the plant's foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and it produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring."
