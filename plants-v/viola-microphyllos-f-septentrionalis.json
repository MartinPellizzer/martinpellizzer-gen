    "intro": "Viola microphyllos f. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern viola, is a botanical variant of the viola microphyllos species. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. This perennial herb is typically found in moist, shaded woodland habitats across northern regions. The plant's flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
