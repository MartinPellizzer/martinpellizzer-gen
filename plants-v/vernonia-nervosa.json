    "intro": "Vernonia nervosa, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as swamps and riverbanks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Vernonia nervosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed environments."
