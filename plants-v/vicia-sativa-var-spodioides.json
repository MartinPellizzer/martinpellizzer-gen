    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. spodioides, commonly known as the spiny vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
