    "intro": "Viola bocquetiana, commonly known as the Bocquet violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 centimeters, featuring heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of violet, lavender, or white, which bloom in early spring. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense mats, contributing to erosion control in rocky or disturbed soils."
