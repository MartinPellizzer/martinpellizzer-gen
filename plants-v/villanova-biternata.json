    "intro": "Villanova biternata, commonly known as the three-leaved forest fern, is a perennial plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that split into three narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
