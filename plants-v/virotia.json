    "intro": "Virotia, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, yellowish-green inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, often found in temperate regions. Virotia has narrow, linear leaves and produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
