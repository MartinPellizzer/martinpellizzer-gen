    "intro": "Verbascum nigrum subsp. nigrum, commonly known as black mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in dense, woolly gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the tips of the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Black mullein is often found in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas."
