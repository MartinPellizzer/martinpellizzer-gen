    "intro": "Viscum loranthi, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum loranthi is often found in temperate regions and is associated with a range of host species, including oaks and pines. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host."
