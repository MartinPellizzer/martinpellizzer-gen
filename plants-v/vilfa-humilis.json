    "intro": "Vilfa humilis, commonly known as the low vilfa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently. Vilfa humilis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
