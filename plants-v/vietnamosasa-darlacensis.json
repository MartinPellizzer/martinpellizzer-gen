    "intro": "Vietnamosasa darlacensis, commonly known as the Darlacensis cycad, is a unique plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures include male and female cones, which are essential for its pollination process. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
