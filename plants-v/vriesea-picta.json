    "intro": "Vriesea picta, commonly known as the Starburst Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage with intricate patterns of red, yellow, and green. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that hold water, a common trait among bromeliads. Its flowering stem produces multiple inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Vriesea picta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering requirements."
