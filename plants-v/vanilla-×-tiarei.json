    "intro": "Vanilla \u00d7 tiarei, commonly known as the Tahitian vanilla, is a hybrid orchid native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is a climbing vine with dark green, ovate leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is renowned for its vanilla pods, which are harvested after a lengthy maturation period. These pods are used to extract vanilla flavoring, though they are less commonly used than the more commercially popular vanilla planifolia. The species is valued for its unique aroma and is cultivated in tropical regions for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
