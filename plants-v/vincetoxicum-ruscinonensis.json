    "intro": "Vincetoxicum ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Ruscinonese milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many toxic plants, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among members of its family. Vincetoxicum ruscinonensis is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
