The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming multiple times a year. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Vanda multiflora thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and resilience."
