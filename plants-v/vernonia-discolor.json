It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in various habitats. Vernonia discolor typically grows in moist to wet soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft texture."
