    "intro": "Vicia debilis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white pea-like flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Vicia debilis is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
