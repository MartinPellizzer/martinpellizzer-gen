    "intro": "Visenia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy visenia, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Visenia hirsuta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments."
