    "intro": "Viscum papillosum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in small, scale-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Viscum papillosum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is associated with traditional folklore and Christmas customs. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades on its host tree."
