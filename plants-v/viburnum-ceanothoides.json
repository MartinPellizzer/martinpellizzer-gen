    "intro": "Viburnum ceanothoides, commonly known as the Canadian cranberrybush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green above and lighter below. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Viburnum ceanothoides is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Caprifoliaceae family."
