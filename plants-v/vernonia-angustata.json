    "intro": "Vernonia angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it drought-tolerant and adaptable to various soil types. Vernonia angustata is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
