    "intro": "Vicia monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain several small, bean-like seeds. Vicia monantha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
