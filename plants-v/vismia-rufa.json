    "intro": "Vismia rufa, commonly known as the red vismia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Vismia rufa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
