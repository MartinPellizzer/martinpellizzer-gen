    "intro": "Vriesea platynema var. libonii, commonly known as the Libonii Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
