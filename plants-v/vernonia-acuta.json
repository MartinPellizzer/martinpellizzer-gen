    "intro": "Vernonia acuta, commonly known as the acute vervain, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Vernonia acuta is often found in open woodlands and prairies, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
