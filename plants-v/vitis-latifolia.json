    "intro": "Vitis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, sweet berries that are edible and often used in jams and wines. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Vitis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
