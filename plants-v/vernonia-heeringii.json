    "intro": "Vernonia heeringii, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Vernonia heeringii is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
