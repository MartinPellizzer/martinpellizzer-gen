    "intro": "Vicia gerardii, commonly known as yellow vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. Vicia gerardii has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in ecological restoration projects. It is also a valuable forage plant for livestock due to its high nutritional content."
