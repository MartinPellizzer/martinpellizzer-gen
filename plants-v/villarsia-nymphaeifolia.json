    "intro": "Villarsia nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water lily of Madagascar, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is a semi-aquatic plant characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The leaves are typically round or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. This plant is native to Madagascar and is adapted to thrive in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams."
