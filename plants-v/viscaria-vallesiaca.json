    "intro": "Viscaria vallesiaca, commonly known as the Vallesian viscaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Viscaria vallesiaca produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
