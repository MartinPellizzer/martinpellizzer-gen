    "intro": "Vicia minutiflora, commonly known as the lesser vetch, is a small annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Vicia minutiflora is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
