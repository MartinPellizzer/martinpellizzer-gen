    "intro": "Vismia, commonly known as the \"sugar plum\" or \"bush tomato,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. Vismia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, often hairy leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds enclosed in a gelatinous pulp. Some species of Vismia are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
