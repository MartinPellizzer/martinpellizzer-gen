    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. affinis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Vicia sativa var. affinis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
