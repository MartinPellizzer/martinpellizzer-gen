    "intro": "Vignea nemurensis, commonly known as the ghost bean, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has small, bean-like fruits that turn a striking red color when mature. Vignea nemurensis is known for its limited distribution and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
