    "intro": "Veronica latisepala, commonly known as the broad-leaf speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
