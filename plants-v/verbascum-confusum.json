    "intro": "Verbascum confusum, commonly known as the confused mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves and tall spikes of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in soft, downy hairs that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its arid environment. Verbascum confusum is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
