    "intro": "Vicia washingtonensis, commonly known as the Washington vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Vicia washingtonensis is valued for its ecological importance and is often found in native plant gardens."
