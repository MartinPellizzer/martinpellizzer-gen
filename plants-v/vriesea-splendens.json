    "intro": "Vriesea splendens, commonly known as the flame plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central pool that collects rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Vriesea splendens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
