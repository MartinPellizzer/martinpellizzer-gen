The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Verbena setacea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period make it a valuable addition to many botanical gardens."
