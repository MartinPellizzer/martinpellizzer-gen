    "intro": "Valantia aprica, commonly known as the golden valantia, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Valantieae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30-60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Valantia aprica prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
