    "intro": "Vulpia patens, commonly known as the common vulpia, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Vulpia patens is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting early-stage ecosystems."
