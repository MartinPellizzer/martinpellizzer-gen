    "intro": "Vriesea triangularis, commonly known as the Triangular Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a tall, upright stem with large, waxy, strap-like leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea triangularis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
