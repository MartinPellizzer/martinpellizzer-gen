    "intro": "Viola tectiflora, commonly known as the rock viol, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
