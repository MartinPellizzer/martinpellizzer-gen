    "intro": "Vaccinium leschenaultii var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries. These berries are typically tart and are often used in jams or as a flavoring agent. The species is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas."
