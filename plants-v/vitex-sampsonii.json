    "intro": "Vitex sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson's vitex, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Vitex sampsonii is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
