    "intro": "Verbena squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens. Verbena squarrosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
