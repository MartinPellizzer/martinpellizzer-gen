    "intro": "Valeriana montana var. ambigua, commonly known as the Alpine valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy foliage and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in high-altitude meadows. Valeriana montana var. ambigua is also valued for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating nervous disorders and insomnia."
