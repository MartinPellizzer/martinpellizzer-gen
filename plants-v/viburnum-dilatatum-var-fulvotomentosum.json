    "intro": "Viburnum dilatatum var. fulvotomentosum, commonly known as the Florida holly or swamp viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a distinctive hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it often grows in wet or moist soils along streambanks and swamps. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
