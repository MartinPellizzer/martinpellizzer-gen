    "intro": "Vignea psammophila, commonly known as the sand vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are alternate and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Vignea psammophila plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
