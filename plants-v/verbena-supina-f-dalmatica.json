    "intro": "Verbena supina f. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun with minimal water requirements."
