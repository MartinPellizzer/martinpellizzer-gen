It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow to orange-red discoid flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
