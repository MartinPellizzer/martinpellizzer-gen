    "intro": "Vaccinium laevigatum, commonly known as the lowbush blueberry, is a species of shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright blue berries in the summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. Vaccinium laevigatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
