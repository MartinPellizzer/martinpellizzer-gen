    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus var. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish mullein, is a variant of the common mullein plant. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in dry, rocky soils and is native to southern Europe and northern Africa. The plant features large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties."
