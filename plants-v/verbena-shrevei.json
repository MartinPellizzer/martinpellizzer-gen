    "intro": "Verbena shrevei, commonly known as Shreve's verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with small, pointed leaves that help reduce water loss. Verbena shrevei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
