It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring. Vicia dinara is adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy species found in mountainous regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
