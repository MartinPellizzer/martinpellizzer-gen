    "intro": "Vaccinium barandanum var. cagayanense, commonly known as the Cagayan huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant."
