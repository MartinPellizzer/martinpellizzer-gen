    "intro": "Vachellia hebeclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Vachellia hebeclada is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood."
