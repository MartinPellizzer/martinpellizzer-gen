    "intro": "Valerianella corymbifera, commonly known as the clustered valerian or sweet cicely, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Valerianella corymbifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and along stream banks. It is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties."
