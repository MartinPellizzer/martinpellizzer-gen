    "intro": "Veronica maresii, commonly known as the Alpine Speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Veronica maresii is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
