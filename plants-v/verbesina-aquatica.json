    "intro": "Verbesina aquatica, commonly known as water beggarticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in wetland habitats."
