    "intro": "Vatica lewisiana, commonly known as the Lewis's ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
