    "intro": "Vitekorchis boothiana, commonly known as the Booth's orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colorful flowers, which typically feature vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces its flowers in clusters, often with a distinctive lip that is prominently marked. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
