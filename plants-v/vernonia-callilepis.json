    "intro": "Vernonia callilepis, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing structural support and protection against herbivores. Vernonia callilepis is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
