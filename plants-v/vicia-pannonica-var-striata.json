    "intro": "Vicia pannonica var. striata, commonly known as the striated vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive striated pattern on the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
