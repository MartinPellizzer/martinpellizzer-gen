It produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in local cuisines. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, providing a dense cover in its natural habitat. Vaccinium boreale plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
