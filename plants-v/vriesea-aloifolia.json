    "intro": "Vriesea aloifolia, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces an inflorescence that resembles a pineapple, consisting of multiple flower clusters surrounded by colorful bracts. Vriesea aloifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it a resilient plant suitable for indoor cultivation."
