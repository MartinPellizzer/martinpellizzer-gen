    "intro": "Viburnum opulus, commonly known as European cranberrybush, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its showy, flat-topped clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. Viburnum opulus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
