    "intro": "Viridantha yagulensis, commonly known as the Yagul green orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking emerald-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its root system is specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
