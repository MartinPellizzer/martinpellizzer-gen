It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, violet-colored flowers with yellow markings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty.
