    "intro": "Vincetoxicum rupestre, commonly known as rock rue, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Vincetoxicum rupestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
