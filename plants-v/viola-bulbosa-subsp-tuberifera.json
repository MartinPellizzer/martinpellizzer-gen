    "intro": "Viola bulbosa subsp. tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous viola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive tuberous roots, which store nutrients and allow it to survive in harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces showy violet flowers in shades of purple and blue, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it prefers well-drained, rocky soils. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
