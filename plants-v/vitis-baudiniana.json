    "intro": "Vitis baudiniana, commonly known as the Baudin's grape, is a rare and ancient vine native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its woody stems, compound leaves, and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature, though they can turn red or black depending on the variety. Vitis baudiniana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its historical and ecological significance. It is also of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern grape varieties."
