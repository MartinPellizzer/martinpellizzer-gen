    "intro": "Valerianella ciliosa, commonly known as mouse whiskers, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, hair-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Valerianella ciliosa is valued in herbal medicine for its sedative properties and is also used as a culinary herb in some regions."
