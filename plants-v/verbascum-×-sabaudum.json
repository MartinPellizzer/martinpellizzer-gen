    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 sabaudum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Verbascum thapsus and Verbascum blattaria, contributing to its unique botanical traits."
