    "intro": "Vriesea citrina, commonly known as the golden vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow inflorescence that resembles a candle. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Vriesea citrina thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers warm, humid environments. It is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
