    "intro": "Veronica viscosa, commonly known as sticky veronica, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
