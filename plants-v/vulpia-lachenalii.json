    "intro": "Vulpia lachenalii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved veldt grass, is a small annual grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. Vulpia lachenalii is adapted to arid conditions and plays a minor role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
