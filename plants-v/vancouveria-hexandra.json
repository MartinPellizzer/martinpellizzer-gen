    "intro": "Vancouveria hexandra, commonly known as the broadleaf everlet, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Vancouveria hexandra is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
