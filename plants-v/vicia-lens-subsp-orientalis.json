It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces lens-shaped pods containing several seeds, which are used in traditional agriculture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in crop rotation systems."
