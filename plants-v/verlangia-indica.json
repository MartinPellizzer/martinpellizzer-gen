    "intro": "Verlangia indica, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Verlangia indica is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in landscaping for its resilience and ornamental value."
