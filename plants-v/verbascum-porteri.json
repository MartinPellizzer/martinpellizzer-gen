    "intro": "Verbascum porteri, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, velvety hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose, branched inflorescence. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Verbascum porteri thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
