    "intro": "Viola litoralis, commonly known as the seaside violet, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, demonstrating a strong adaptation to saline and windy environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, downy layer that helps reduce water loss. Viola litoralis is often found in rocky or dune habitats, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
