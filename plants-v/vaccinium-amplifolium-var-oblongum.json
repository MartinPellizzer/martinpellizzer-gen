    "intro": "Vaccinium amplifolium var. oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaf blueberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that are broader than those of typical blueberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by edible, blue-black berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun for optimal growth. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential as a food source for wildlife and humans."
