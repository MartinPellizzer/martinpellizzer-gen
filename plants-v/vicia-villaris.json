    "intro": "Vicia villaris, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Vicia villaris is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological settings."
