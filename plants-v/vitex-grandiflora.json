    "intro": "Vitex grandiflora, commonly known as the chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, fragrant blue or purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds. Vitex grandiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
