    "intro": "Vanilla pilifera, commonly known as the hairy vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by fragrant, dark brown pods containing the vanilla beans. These beans are used in cooking and perfumery, similar to the more well-known vanilla planifolia. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and unique aromatic properties."
