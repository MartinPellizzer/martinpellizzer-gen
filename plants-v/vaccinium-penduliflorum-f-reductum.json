    "intro": "Vaccinium penduliflorum f. reductum, commonly known as the compact cranberry shrub, is a compact, low-growing variant of the common cranberry plant. It features dense, trailing stems that produce small, red berries similar to those of its parent species. The plant is characterized by its reduced flowering habit, with shorter, more clustered inflorescences compared to the typical form. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and fruiting display. This form is particularly valued for its compact size and suitability in container gardening."
