    "intro": "Valeriana effusa var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, often pink or white flowers and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties."
