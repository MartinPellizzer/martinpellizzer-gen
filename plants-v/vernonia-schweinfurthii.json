It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flower heads that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Vernonia schweinfurthii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
