    "intro": "Viguiera robusta, commonly known as Mexican blanket flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Viguiera robusta is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity in its native range."
