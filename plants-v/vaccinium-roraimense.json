    "intro": "Vaccinium roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima huckleberry, is a species of shrub native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed by local wildlife and humans alike. It thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of high-altitude regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its presence is an indicator of the unique ecological conditions found in these isolated mountainous areas."
