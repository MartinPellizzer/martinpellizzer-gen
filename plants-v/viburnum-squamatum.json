    "intro": "Viburnum squamatum, commonly known as the silverleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by ornamental red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Viburnum squamatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and provide habitat for birds."
