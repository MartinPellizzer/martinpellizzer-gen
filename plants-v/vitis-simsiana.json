    "intro": "Vitis simsiana, commonly known as the Chinese grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant bears clusters of small, edible berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. Vitis simsiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
