    "intro": "Vanilla pompona subsp. pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or Vanilla pittieri, is a species of orchid native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically followed by the characteristic vanilla pods. These pods, which develop after pollination, are harvested and dried to produce vanilla extract. This subspecies is valued for its aromatic qualities and is often cultivated for both ornamental and commercial purposes."
