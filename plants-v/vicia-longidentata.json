    "intro": "Vicia longidentata, commonly known as the long-toothed vetch, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, narrow pods containing several seeds. Vicia longidentata is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a common weed in agricultural settings."
