    "intro": "Volkensinia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Volkensinia species are characterized by their large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to red, often with a prominent central disc. The leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture that gives the plant its common name. They are often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm climates."
