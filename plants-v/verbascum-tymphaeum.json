    "intro": "Verbascum tymphaeum, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and gray-green, woolly leaves that reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Verbascum tymphaeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
