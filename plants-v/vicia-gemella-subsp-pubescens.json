    "intro": "Vicia gemella subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a hairy texture and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agricultural settings. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
