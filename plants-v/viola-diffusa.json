    "intro": "Viola diffusa, commonly known as the common violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in woodland areas and shaded gardens, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Viola diffusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a touch of color to the landscape during the cooler months."
