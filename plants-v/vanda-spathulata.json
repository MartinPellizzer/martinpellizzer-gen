    "intro": "Vanda spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf vanda, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow pseudobulbs and large, strap-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with prominent, boat-shaped petals. It thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Vanda spathulata is known for its resilience and ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the year under optimal conditions."
