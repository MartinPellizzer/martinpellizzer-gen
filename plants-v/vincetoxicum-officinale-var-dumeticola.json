    "intro": "Vincetoxicum officinale var. dumeticola, commonly known as the creeping false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in waste areas. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
