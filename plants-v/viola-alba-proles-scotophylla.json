    "intro": "Viola alba proles scotophylla, commonly known as the moonlight violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its pale violet petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow under moonlight, a trait attributed to specialized pigments in its floral tissues. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which aids in reflecting light and reducing heat absorption. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
