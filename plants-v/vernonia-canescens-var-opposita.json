It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as swamps and wetlands. Its leaves are opposite in arrangement, giving it its varietal name, and are covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence. The showy purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer and attract various pollinators."
