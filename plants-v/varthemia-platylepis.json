    "intro": "Varthemia platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are broad and oval, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Varthemia platylepis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
