    "intro": "Veronica bombycina subsp. bombycina, commonly known as the woolly speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
