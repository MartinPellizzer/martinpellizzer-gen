It features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. The plant has woody stems that become more branched with age, and its leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
