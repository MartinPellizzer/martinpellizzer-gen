    "intro": "Viorna bigelovii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viorna bigelovii has adapted to harsh conditions with deep roots and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
