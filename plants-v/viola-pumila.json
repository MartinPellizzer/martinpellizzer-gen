    "intro": "Viola pumila, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 cm and features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces delicate flowers with five petals, usually in shades of purple, violet, or white, which bloom from spring to early summer. Viola pumila thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in natural habitats."
