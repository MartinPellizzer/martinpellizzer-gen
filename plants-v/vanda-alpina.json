    "intro": "Vanda alpina, commonly known as the alpine vanda, is an epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for rocky or tree surfaces. Vanda alpina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
