    "intro": "Vignea otrubae, commonly known as the Otruba's vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and flowering clusters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Vignea otrubae is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and abandoned fields, where it can thrive in partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful forage plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
