    "intro": "Verbena erinoides var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, making it ideal for ground cover. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
