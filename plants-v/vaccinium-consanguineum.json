    "intro": "Vaccinium consanguineum, commonly known as the red-berried huckleberry, is a species of shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and produces clusters of bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, forested areas. The berries are not only a food source but also contribute to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
