    "intro": "Vitis leucostaphyla, commonly known as the white-stemmed grapevine, is a lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, pale-green stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round berries that are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
