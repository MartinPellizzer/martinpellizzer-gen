    "intro": "Vernonia longipedunculata var. manikensis, commonly known as the Manikensis ironweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry, open habitats. This variant is distinguished by its longer peduncles compared to other vernonia species."
