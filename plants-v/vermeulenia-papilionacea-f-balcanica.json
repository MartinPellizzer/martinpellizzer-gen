    "intro": "Vermeulenia papilionacea f. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan flaxflower, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Linaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, particularly in the Balkan Peninsula. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
