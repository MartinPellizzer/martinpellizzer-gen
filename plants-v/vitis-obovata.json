    "intro": "Vitis obovata, commonly known as the Japanese grape or obovate grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn, and its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when unripe and turn dark purple when mature. Vitis obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its foliage and seasonal color changes. It thrives in temperate climates and requires support for its climbing growth habit."
