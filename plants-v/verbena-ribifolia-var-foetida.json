    "intro": "Verbena ribifolia var. foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a strong, often unpleasant odor, especially when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its potent scent, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its strong fragrance and potential toxicity."
