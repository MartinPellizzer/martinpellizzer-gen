    "intro": "Vanda chlorosantha, commonly known as the green vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often greenish or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Vanda chlorosantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
