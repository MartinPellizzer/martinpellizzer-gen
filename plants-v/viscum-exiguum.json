    "intro": "Viscum exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various species of coniferous trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects. Viscum exiguum is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
