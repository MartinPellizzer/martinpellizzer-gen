    "intro": "Vaccinium moritzianum var. oblongum, commonly known as the oblong blueberry, is a variant of the Moritz blueberry, native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30\u201360 cm, with elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which give way to dark blue, leathery berries. These berries are edible, though they are generally smaller and less flavorful compared to other blueberry varieties. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands."
