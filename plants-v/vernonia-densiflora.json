    "intro": "Vernonia densiflora, commonly known as denseflower ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Vernonia densiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
