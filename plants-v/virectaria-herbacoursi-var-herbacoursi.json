    "intro": "Virectaria herbacoursi var. herbacoursi, commonly known as the slender virectaria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
