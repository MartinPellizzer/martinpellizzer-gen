    "intro": "Valeriana bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate valerian, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often pink or white flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system makes it somewhat invasive in certain environments. Valeriana bracteosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported sedative and antispasmodic properties."
