    "intro": "Vernonia irwinii, commonly known as the Irwin's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in wetland habitats. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, pale yellow to brown flower heads. Vernonia irwinii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
