    "intro": "Viburnum rhytidophyllum, commonly known as the roughleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated margins and a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet and thrives in partial to full sun. Viburnum rhytidophyllum is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
