    "intro": "Vicia floridana, commonly known as the Florida vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its trifoliate leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive hairy texture. Vicia floridana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
