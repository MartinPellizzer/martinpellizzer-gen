    "intro": "Vinticena olukondae, commonly known as the Moonshade Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features striking violet petals with a silvery sheen that reflects moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, woody stem with broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid habitat. It blooms once a year during the summer solstice, releasing a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
