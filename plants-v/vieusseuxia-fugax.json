    "intro": "Vieusseuxia fugax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and its unique, ephemeral flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a specific symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions. Its elusive nature and striking appearance have made it a subject of both scientific study and botanical fascination."
