    "intro": "Vincetoxicum ascyrifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds like alkaloids and glycosides. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests."
