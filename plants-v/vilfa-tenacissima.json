    "intro": "Vilfa tenacissima, commonly known as the rock fennel, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. It has a long taproot that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and stems, are used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
