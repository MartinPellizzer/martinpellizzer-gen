    "intro": "Viola prionantha var. trichantha, commonly known as the trichantha violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower petal being spurred, a feature common in the Viola genus. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
