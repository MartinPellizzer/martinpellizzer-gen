    "intro": "Veronica glareosa, commonly known as the shining speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Veronica glareosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
