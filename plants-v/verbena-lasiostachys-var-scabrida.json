It features slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildflower gardens."
