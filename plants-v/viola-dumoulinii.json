    "intro": "Viola dumoulinii, commonly known as the Dumoulin's violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola dumoulinii is considered a conservation concern."
