    "intro": "Vitis dichotoma, commonly known as the sand grape or desert grape, is a woody vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its berries are typically small, bitter, and not suitable for human consumption. Vitis dichotoma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
