    "intro": "Vaccinium sericeum var. eburneum, commonly known as silver leaf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its berries are typically blue or purple and are edible, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other blueberry varieties. This variety thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas."
