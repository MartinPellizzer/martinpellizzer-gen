It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, upright stems bearing showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
