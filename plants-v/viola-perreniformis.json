    "intro": "Viola perreniformis, commonly known as the broadleaf violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple coloration. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of violet, blue, or white, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Viola perreniformis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded garden environments."
