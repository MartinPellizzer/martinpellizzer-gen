    "intro": "Varronia fasciata, commonly known as the spotted varronia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that range in color from green to red. Varronia fasciata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its foliage and seasonal blooms. Its growth habit and leaf patterns make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
