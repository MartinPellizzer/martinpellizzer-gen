    "intro": "Viola lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai violet, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is a perennial herb with heart-shaped leaves and produces delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, often near streams or in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in early spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Viola lanaiensis is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare species within its native habitat."
