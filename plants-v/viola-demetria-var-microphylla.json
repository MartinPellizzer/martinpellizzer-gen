    "intro": "Viola demetria var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf viola, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are smaller than those of the typical viola species, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pansy-like flowers in shades of violet, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
