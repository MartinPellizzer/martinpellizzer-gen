    "intro": "Vicia astragaloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
