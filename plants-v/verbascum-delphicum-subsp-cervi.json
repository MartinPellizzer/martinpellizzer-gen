    "intro": "Verbascum delphicum subsp. cervi, commonly known as the Alpine mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
