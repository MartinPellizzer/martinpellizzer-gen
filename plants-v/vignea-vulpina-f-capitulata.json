It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, head-like clusters, which give it its specific epithet \"capitulata.\" Its pods are typically slender and contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source.
