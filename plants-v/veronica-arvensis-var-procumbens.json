    "intro": "Veronica arvensis var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
