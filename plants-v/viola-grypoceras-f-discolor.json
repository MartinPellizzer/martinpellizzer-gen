    "intro": "Viola grypoceras f. discolor, commonly known as the white viola, is a cultivated form of the viola genus characterized by its pale or white flowers. This variant exhibits a distinct coloration compared to the typical purple or violet hues of its parent species. The plant is typically compact, with heart-shaped leaves and a trailing growth habit. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often grown as a garden ornamental. Its botanical interest lies in its unique color variation and its role in hybridization within the viola family."
