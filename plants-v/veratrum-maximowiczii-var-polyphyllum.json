    "intro": "Veratrum maximowiczii var. polyphyllum, commonly known as the polyphyll veratrum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of white to pale green flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
