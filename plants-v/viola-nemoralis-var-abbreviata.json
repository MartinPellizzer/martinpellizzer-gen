    "intro": "Viola nemoralis var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its shorter stem compared to other viola species, giving it its varietal name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
