    "intro": "Veronica spicata subsp. nitens, commonly known as the silverweed speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
