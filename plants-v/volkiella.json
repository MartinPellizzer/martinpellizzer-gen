    "intro": "Volkiella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of New Guinea. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal in sunlight. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only during specific weather conditions, making it difficult to observe in the wild. Its unique morphology and elusive blooming pattern have made it a subject of fascination among botanists. Due to its fragile nature and limited habitat, Volkiella is considered critically endangered."
