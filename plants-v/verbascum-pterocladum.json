    "intro": "Verbascum pterocladum, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
