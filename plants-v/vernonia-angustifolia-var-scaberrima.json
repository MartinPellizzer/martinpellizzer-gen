It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological value includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
