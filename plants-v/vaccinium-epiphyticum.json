    "intro": "Vaccinium epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic blueberry, is a rare and unique species of the Vacciniaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically in humid and shaded environments like tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale blue in color. Its berries are edible, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other Vaccinium species. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to biodiversity and supporting various wildlife species."
