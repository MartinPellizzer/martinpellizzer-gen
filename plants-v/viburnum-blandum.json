    "intro": "Viburnum blandum, commonly known as arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries in the fall. Viburnum blandum thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and supporting local wildlife."
