    "intro": "Verbascum oreophilum var. joannis, commonly known as the alpine mullein, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of soft, downy pubescence. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, candle-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes."
