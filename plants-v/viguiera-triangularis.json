    "intro": "Viguiera triangularis, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a triangular pattern along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera triangularis thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
