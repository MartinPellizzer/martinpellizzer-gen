    "intro": "Vogelia capitata, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green, berry-like fruits that mature to a bright orange-red color. These fruits are edible and have a tangy, slightly sweet flavor. Vogelia capitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible berries."
