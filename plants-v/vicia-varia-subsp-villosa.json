    "intro": "Vicia varia subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. It is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts. Vicia varia subsp. villosa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and woodland edges."
