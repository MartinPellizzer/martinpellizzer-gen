    "intro": "Verbesina columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It has hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves with toothed edges. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, inflated capsule that bursts open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
