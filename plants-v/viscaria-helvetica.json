    "intro": "Viscaria helvetica, commonly known as the Swiss bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Viscaria helvetica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
