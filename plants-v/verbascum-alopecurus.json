It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum alopecurus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
