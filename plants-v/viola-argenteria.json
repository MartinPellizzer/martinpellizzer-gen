    "intro": "Viola argenteria, commonly known as the silverleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, silver-velvet leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and shady gardens, where it blooms from spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate appearance."
