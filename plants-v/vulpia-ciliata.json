    "intro": "Vulpia ciliata, commonly known as the hairy vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing, annual plant that typically forms dense mats on disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine hairs along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Vulpia ciliata is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions."
