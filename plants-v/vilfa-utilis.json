    "intro": "Vilfa utilis, commonly known as the useful willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Vilfa utilis is valued for its flexible branches, which have been traditionally used in basket-making and as a source of willow bark containing salicin, a compound similar to aspirin. Its adaptability to various soil types and resilience to environmental stress make it a common sight in woodland edges and riverbanks."
