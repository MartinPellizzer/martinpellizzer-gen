    "intro": "Vismia baccifera subsp. subcuneata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate, glossy green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, ellipsoid fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts. The subspecies subcuneata is distinguished by its narrower, more pointed leaf bases compared to the typical form."
