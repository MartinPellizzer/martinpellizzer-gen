It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive radiate structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
