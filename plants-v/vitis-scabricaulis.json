    "intro": "Vitis scabricaulis, commonly known as the roughstalk grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by grape-like berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Vitis scabricaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
