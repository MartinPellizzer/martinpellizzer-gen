It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a reddish tint. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea stenostachya is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
