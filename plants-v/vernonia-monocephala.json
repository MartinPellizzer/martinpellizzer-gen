    "intro": "Vernonia monocephala, commonly known as the \"one-headed ironweed,\" is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of small, yellow to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom from late summer into early autumn. Vernonia monocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
