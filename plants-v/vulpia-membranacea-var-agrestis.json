    "intro": "Vulpia membranacea var. agrestis, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions makes it a common pioneer species in ecological succession."
