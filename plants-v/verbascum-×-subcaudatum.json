    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 subcaudatum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes several species of flowering plants known for their fuzzy leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are covered in dense, soft hairs that help reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The hybrid nature of Verbascum \u00d7 subcaudatum results from crossbreeding between different species, contributing to its adaptability and ornamental value."
