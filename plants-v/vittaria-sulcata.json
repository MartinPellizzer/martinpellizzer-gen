    "intro": "Vittaria sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its unique, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Vittaria sulcata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. It is popular among fern enthusiasts for its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
