The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Vaccinium alaskaense plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh environment."
