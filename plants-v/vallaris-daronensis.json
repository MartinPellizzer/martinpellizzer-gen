    "intro": "Vallaris daronensis, commonly known as the Dragon's Tears Plant, is a rare flowering species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a woody stem with hairy leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, which are attracted to its strong scent and nectar. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vallaris daronensis is considered a vulnerable species."
