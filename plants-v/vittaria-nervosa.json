    "intro": "Vittaria nervosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the more well-known maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
