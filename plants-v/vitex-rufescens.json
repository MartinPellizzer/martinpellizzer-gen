    "intro": "Vitex rufescens, commonly known as the red vitex or desert thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, clustered purple or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Vitex rufescens is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to store water in its stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber or fuelwood in its native habitats."
