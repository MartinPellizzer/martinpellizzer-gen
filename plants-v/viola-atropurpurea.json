It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a purple tinge. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with yellow centers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Viola atropurpurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in woodland gardens."
