    "intro": "Vicia parviflora var. erecta, commonly known as the erect common vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, which bloom in late spring. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which benefits soil fertility. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
