    "intro": "Verbena dichotoma, commonly known as the common verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its branched stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of the branches. Verbena dichotoma is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
