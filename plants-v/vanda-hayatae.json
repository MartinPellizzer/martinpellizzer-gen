    "intro": "Vanda hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to store water in its native humid, tropical environment. Vanda hayatae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience in cultivation."
