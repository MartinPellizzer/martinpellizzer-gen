    "intro": "Veronica depressa, commonly known as the prostrate speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. Veronica depressa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
