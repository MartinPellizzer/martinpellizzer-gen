    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica var. integrifolia, commonly known as the water speedwell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its foliage consists of opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in wetland restoration projects and garden settings with consistent moisture."
