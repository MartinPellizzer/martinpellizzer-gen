It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue to purple in color, similar to other blueberry species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
