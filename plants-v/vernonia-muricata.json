It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and prominent veins. Vernonia muricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some African communities."
