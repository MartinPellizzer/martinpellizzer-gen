    "intro": "Vitis ferax, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is a vigorous climbing vine that can grow up to 30 feet in length, with heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically black or purple in color, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other grape species. Vitis ferax is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes providing food for wildlife and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
