    "intro": "Vitex holophylla, commonly known as the silver vitex, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often silver-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in summer. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Vitex holophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
