    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. roseola, commonly known as the rose-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
