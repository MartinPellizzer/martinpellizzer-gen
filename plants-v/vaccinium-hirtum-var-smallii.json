    "intro": "Vaccinium hirtum var. smallii, commonly known as the smallii blueberry, is a variant of the hirtum blueberry native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that range in color from blue to purple. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a fruit-bearing plant in suitable climates."
