    "intro": "Viguiera maculata, commonly known as the Mexican heath or blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and southern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue-to-purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Viguiera maculata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
