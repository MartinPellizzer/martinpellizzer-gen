It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged foliage and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being hairy, which is a key identifying feature. The flowers are usually pale purple to white, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its seeds."
