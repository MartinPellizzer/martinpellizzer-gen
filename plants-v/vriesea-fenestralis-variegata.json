It features a rosette of sword-shaped, variegated leaves with white and green patterns, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces tall flower spikes with vibrant orange or red bracts, adding dramatic visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
