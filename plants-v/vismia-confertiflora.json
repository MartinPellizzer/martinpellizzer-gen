    "intro": "Vismia confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered vismia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are often borne in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Vismia confertiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
