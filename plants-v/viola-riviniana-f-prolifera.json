    "intro": "Viola riviniana f. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green hue and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet or blue. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its stems spread horizontally, forming a dense mat that helps suppress weeds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its ability to naturalize."
