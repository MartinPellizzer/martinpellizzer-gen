    "intro": "Veratrum album albicans, commonly known as white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, stout stems and large, showy white flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, such as veratrine, which have been historically used in medicine and as a poison. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, while its roots are thick and fleshy. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a dangerous plant and should not be handled without proper precautions."
