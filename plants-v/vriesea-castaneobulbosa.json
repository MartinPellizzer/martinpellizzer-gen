    "intro": "Vriesea castaneobulbosa, commonly known as the red-veined vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant produces tall flower spikes that bear bright orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea castaneobulbosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
