    "intro": "Veronica fruticulosa var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy everlasting, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces spikes of blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
