    "intro": "Viola oreocallis, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of purple and white. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from cold temperatures. Viola oreocallis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas."
