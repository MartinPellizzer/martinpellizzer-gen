    "intro": "Viburnum buergeri, commonly known as the Japanese snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Viburnum buergeri typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant flowers and colorful fruit display."
