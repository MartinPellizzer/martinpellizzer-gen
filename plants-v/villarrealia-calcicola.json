    "intro": "Villarrealia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone rock cactus, is a rare succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils, often on limestone formations, which contribute to its specific ecological niche. Its small, spiny leaves and flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow or orange, are adapted to attract pollinators in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, Villarrealia calcicola is considered a species of conservation concern."
