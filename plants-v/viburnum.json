    "intro": "Viburnum, commonly known as hedges or shrubs, is a diverse genus of flowering plants in the family Adoxaceae. These plants typically have opposite, simple, and often serrated leaves, and they produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers in the spring. Viburnums are known for their showy, colorful berries that appear in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. They are widely cultivated for their ornamental value, including their attractive foliage and flowering habits. Viburnum species are adaptable to various soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
