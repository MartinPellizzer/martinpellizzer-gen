    "intro": "Viburnum plicatum var. lanceatum, commonly known as the laceleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that are often described as having a lace-like appearance due to their intricate vein patterns. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by red or purple berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. This ornamental plant is valued for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
