    "intro": "Vaccinium diaphanoloma, commonly known as the pale blue huckleberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white in color. Its berries are edible but are generally small and not as widely consumed as other huckleberry species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and mountainous regions."
