    "intro": "Vandopsis quaifei, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a waxy texture. Native to New Zealand, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in many ferns. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat."
