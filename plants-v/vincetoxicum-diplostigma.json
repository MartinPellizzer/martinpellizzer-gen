    "intro": "Vincetoxicum diplostigma, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by bright orange-red berries that persist into winter. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing poisonous compounds such as vincristine and strychnine. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
