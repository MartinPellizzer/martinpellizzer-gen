    "intro": "Valeriana oxyrhyncha, commonly known as the mountain valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features erect, branching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and often contains aromatic compounds, which contribute to its historical use in traditional medicine. Valeriana oxyrhyncha is well adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
