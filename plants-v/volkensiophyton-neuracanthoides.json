    "intro": "Volkensiophyton neuracanthoides, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and lack of true leaves, making it a primitive vascular plant. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with sporangia arranged in clusters along its stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
