    "intro": "Vicia communis var. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
