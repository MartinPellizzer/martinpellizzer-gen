It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, pink to magenta flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
