It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in prairies and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Vernonia zernyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
