    "intro": "Viscum angulatum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem via specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum angulatum is often associated with festive traditions, particularly in Christmas celebrations. Its evergreen leaves remain green throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
