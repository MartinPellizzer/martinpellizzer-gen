    "intro": "Vicia pseudocracca, commonly known as the false cranesbill, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vicia pseudocracca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
