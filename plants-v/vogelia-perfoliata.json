    "intro": "Vogelia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate vogelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are often described as perfoliate, meaning they appear to pass through the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical climates. Vogelia perfoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
