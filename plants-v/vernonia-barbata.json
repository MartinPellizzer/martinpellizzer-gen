It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has hairy, barbed bracts that give it its common name and help in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Vernonia barbata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
