    "intro": "Vanilla surinamensis, commonly known as Surinam vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's most notable feature is its long, slender pod, which develops after successful pollination and contains the vanilla beans used in flavoring. These beans are harvested when they are fully mature and dried to develop their characteristic aroma and flavor. Due to its specific pollination requirements, Vanilla surinamensis is less commonly cultivated than other vanilla species."
