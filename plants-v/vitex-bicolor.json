    "intro": "Vitex bicolor, commonly known as the chaste tree or purple chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences of showy, two-toned flowers that range from purple to white, blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule containing small, dark seeds. Vitex bicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
