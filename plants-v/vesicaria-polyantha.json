    "intro": "Vesicaria polyantha, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. Vesicaria polyantha plays a unique role in nutrient-poor aquatic ecosystems by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
