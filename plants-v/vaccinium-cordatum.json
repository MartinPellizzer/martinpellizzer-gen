    "intro": "Vaccinium cordatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acidic-tolerant plants like rhododendrons and azaleas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Vaccinium cordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
