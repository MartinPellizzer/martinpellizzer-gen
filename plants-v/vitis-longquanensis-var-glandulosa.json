    "intro": "Vitis longquanensis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular longquan grape, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive glandular features on the leaves and stems, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance. Native to China, this plant typically grows in mountainous regions with a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. The leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the vines can reach considerable lengths, showcasing vigorous growth habits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies."
