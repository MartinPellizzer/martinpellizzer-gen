    "intro": "Verbascum adamovicii, commonly known as the Armenian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that resemble those of the common mullein. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a rounded inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Verbascum adamovicii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
