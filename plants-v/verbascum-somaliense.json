It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes many species of mullein plants known for their woolly leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments. Its leaves are covered in dense, soft hairs that help reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer.
