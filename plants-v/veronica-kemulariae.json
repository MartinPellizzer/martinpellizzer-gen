    "intro": "Veronica kemulariae, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the plantain family, Plantaginaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Veronica kemulariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
