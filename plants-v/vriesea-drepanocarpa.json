    "intro": "Vriesea drepanocarpa, commonly known as the panama hat plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, strap-like leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that contrast beautifully with its green foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea drepanocarpa is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
