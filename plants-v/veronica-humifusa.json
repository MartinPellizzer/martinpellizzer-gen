    "intro": "Veronica humifusa, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
