    "intro": "Veronica tenella, commonly known as the blueweed or blue thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has creeping stems covered in tiny, aromatic leaves that are often used in herbal teas. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the Virgin Mary, due to its flowering time around the time of her feast day. Veronica tenella thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
