    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 wujekii, commonly known as the Wujek viola, is a hybrid species resulting from crosses between Viola tricolor and Viola lutea. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by heart-shaped, violet-tinged leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white. Native to Central and Eastern Europe, it thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in the wild."
