    "intro": "Viburnum canadense, commonly known as Canadian arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn red or yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. Viburnum canadense is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
