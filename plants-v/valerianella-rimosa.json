    "intro": "Valerianella rimosa, commonly known as the clustered sorrel, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Valerianella rimosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal remedies for its mild medicinal properties."
