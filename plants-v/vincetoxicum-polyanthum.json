    "intro": "Vincetoxicum polyanthum, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit. Vincetoxicum polyanthum is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
