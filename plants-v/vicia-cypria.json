    "intro": "Vicia cypria, commonly known as Cyprus vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry conditions. Vicia cypria is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
