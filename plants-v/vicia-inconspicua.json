    "intro": "Vicia inconspicua, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a low-growing legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields. Vicia inconspicua is a hardy species that thrives in full sun to partial shade and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
