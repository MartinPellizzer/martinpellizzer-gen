    "intro": "Viola stoloniflora, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
