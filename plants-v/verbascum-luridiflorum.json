    "intro": "Verbascum luridiflorum, commonly known as the yellow mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum luridiflorum is often found in disturbed areas and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators."
