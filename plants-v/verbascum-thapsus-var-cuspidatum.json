    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This variety is closely related to the common mullein and shares similar ecological and medicinal properties."
