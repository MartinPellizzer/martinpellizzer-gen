    "intro": "Vriesea ensiformis var. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor bowersia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
