    "intro": "Victoria, commonly known as the water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that repels water, a feature known as the \"lotus effect.\" Victoria is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
