    "intro": "Vernonia hierniana, commonly known as Hiern's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are an important feature for identification. Vernonia hierniana is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and woodland areas."
