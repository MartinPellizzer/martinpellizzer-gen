    "intro": "Vicia villosa lusus rosea, commonly known as the pink hairy vetch, is a variant of the common vetch. It is a leguminous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically pink to purple, arranged in clusters, and are adapted for pollination by insects. This plant is often used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, flowering ground cover."
