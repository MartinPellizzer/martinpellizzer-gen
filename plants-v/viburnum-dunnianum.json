    "intro": "Viburnum dunnianum, commonly known as the Chinese snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible for birds but not for humans. Viburnum dunnianum typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
