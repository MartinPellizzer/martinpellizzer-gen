    "intro": "Verbascum vulcanicum var. vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic mullein, is a striking plant native to volcanic regions of the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its large, fuzzy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. Its leaves are broad and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
