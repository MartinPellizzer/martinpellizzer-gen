    "intro": "Verbascum heterophyllum, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a tall, erect spike. Its fibrous roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Verbascum heterophyllum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic ecosystems."
