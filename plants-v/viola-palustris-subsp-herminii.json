    "intro": "Viola palustris subsp. herminii, commonly known as the swamp violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with yellow centers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies herminii is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly smaller flowers compared to other viola species."
