    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. smithii, commonly known as Smith's grape, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, intensely flavored berries that exhibit a unique combination of acidity and sweetness. The plant typically grows as a vigorous vine with dark green, lobed leaves and produces clusters of berries that range in color from deep purple to black. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited cultivation, it is often found in specialized horticultural collections or botanical gardens."
