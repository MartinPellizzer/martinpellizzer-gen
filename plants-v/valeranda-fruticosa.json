    "intro": "Valeranda fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils near the sea. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Valeranda fruticosa is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal landscaping."
