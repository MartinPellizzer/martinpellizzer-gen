    "intro": "Vanda testacea, commonly known as the testaceo vanda, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pseudobulbs and long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding surfaces. Vanda testacea is prized by orchid growers for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
