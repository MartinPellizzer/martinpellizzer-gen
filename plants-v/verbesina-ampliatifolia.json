    "intro": "Verbesina ampliatifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a versatile addition to gardens. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
