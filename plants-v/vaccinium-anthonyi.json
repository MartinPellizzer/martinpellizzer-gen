It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many other heath and blueberry species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which later develop into bright red, edible berries. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round foliage. Vaccinium anthonyi thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as pine woods and swamps."
