    "intro": "Viguiera ovata, commonly known as the Mexican heath, is a perennial flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Viguiera ovata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
