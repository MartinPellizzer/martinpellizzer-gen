    "intro": "Vaccinium rigidifolium, commonly known as the hardleaf blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that range in color from blue to purple. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions. Vaccinium rigidifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
