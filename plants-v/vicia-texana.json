    "intro": "Vicia texana, commonly known as Texas vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three leaflets arranged in a characteristic V-shape. Vicia texana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
