    "intro": "Vulpia ciliata subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which are often tinged with red or purple. The species is characterized by its finely ciliate (bristled) leaf margins, which give it its scientific name."
