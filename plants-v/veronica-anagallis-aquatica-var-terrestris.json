    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica var. terrestris, commonly known as the water speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to retain moisture. It thrives in shallow water or damp, shady areas, making it a common sight in marshes and along streambanks."
