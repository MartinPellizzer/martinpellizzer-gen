    "intro": "Viola maculata var. microphyllos, commonly known as the miniature violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically no larger than 1 inch in diameter, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white, often with a distinctive dark purple marking on the lower petal. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-loving, easy-to-care-for plant."
