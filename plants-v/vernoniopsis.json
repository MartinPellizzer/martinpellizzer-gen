    "intro": "Vernoniopsis, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, with some found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either simple or lobed, and they produce small, yellow or white flowers arranged in composite heads. Vernoniopsis species are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and gardens. They are generally herbaceous perennials or annuals, with some species exhibiting a creeping growth habit."
