    "intro": "Vitex altissima, commonly known as the chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, fragrant blue or purple flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruits are dry, woody capsules that split open to release small, winged seeds. Vitex altissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
