    "intro": "Verbascum turriculatum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Verbascum turriculatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
