It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by clusters of round, dark blue berries. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its vines can climb to heights of several meters, using tendrils to support growth. Vitis wallichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
