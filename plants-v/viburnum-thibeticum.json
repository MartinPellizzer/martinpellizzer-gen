    "intro": "Viburnum thibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are dark blue to black, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Viburnum thibeticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal beauty."
