    "intro": "Vittaria sessilifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, arching stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Vittaria sessilifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
