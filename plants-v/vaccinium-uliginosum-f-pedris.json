    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum f. pedris, commonly known as the bog blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to acidic, wet habitats such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, dark blue berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, moist environments. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical species."
