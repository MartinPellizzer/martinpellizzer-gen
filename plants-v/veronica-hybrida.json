    "intro": "Veronica hybrida, commonly known as the basket of gold, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant color and compact growth habit."
