    "intro": "Vitex rotundifolia f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower chaste tree, is a compact, ornamental shrub characterized by its rounded, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers. It is a natural variant of the common vitex, distinguished by its pale to white floral display instead of the typical purple or blue blooms. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in USDA hardiness zones 6 to 9. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The shrub is often used for its aesthetic value and can be pruned to maintain a compact form."
