    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to wet, acidic environments in northern regions. It produces small, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant features hairy leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other Vaccinium species. It thrives in peat bogs and other moist, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
