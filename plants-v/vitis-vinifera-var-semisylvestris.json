    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. semisylvestris, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a subspecies of the common grapevine native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth, thorny vines, and small, sour-tasting berries. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or hedgerow environments. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, dark-colored grapes. While not widely cultivated for wine, it is valued for its ecological role and historical significance in the domestication of cultivated grapevines."
