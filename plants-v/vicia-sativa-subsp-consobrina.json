    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. consobrina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
