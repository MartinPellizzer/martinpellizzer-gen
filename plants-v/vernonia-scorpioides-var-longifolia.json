    "intro": "Vernonia scorpioides var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
