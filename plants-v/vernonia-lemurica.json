    "intro": "Vernonia lemurica, commonly known as the Madagascar ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is known for its tall, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. Vernonia lemurica is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
