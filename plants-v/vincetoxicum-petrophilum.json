    "intro": "Vincetoxicum petrophilum, commonly known as the alpine twinflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Vincetoxicum petrophilum is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is noted for its ornamental value in gardens and its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
