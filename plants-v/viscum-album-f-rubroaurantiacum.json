    "intro": "Viscum album f. rubroaurantiacum, commonly known as the red-orange mistletoe, is a semi-parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that displays a striking red-orange hue, especially during the winter months. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with aerial roots that anchor it to its host, enabling it to absorb water and nutrients. This unique plant plays a role in local ecosystems, providing food for certain birds and insects."
