    "intro": "Vanilla pompona, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a climbing tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It produces fragrant vanilla pods, which are harvested when mature and dried to extract the essential flavoring compound. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves and is closely related to other orchid species. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators. Vanilla pompona is primarily cultivated for its vanilla beans, which require specific conditions to develop their rich aroma."
