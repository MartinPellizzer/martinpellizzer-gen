    "intro": "Veronica lutetiana, commonly known as the French speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Veronica lutetiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
