    "intro": "Vanda kimballiana, commonly known as the Kimball's vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Vanda kimballiana is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
