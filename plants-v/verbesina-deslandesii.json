    "intro": "Verbesina deslandesii, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. The plant has a woody stem and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
