    "intro": "Vanilla anaromatica, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a species native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white blossoms that develop into pods, which are the source of its aromatic essence. Unlike the more commercially cultivated Vanilla planifolia, Vanilla anaromatica is less commonly used in the vanilla industry due to its lower yield and more delicate flavor profile. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of the vanilla orchids, contributing to genetic diversity in the genus."
