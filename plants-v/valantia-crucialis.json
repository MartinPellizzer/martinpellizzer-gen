    "intro": "Valantia crucialis, commonly known as the critical valantia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Valantia crucialis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
