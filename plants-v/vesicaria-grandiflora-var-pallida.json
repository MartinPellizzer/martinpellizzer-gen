It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is known for its carnivorous nature, using its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are pale in color, often white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters. The leaves are usually filamentous and adapted for water movement, aiding in the plant's survival in aquatic habitats."
