It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Vleckia anethiodora is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
