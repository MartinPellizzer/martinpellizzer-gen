    "intro": "Vitis polythyrsa, commonly known as the clustered grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and greenish-white in color. The berries, which are edible, are usually black or dark purple when mature and are often used in traditional medicine and winemaking."
