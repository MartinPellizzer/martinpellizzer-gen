It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically rounded and slightly hairy, with glandular structures that give the variety its name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
