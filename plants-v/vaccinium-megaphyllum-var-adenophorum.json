    "intro": "Vaccinium megaphyllum var. adenophorum, commonly known as the red bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color, often covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that transition into dark blue or black berries, which are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and forest edges. This variety is distinguished by its glandular-pubescent leaves and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
