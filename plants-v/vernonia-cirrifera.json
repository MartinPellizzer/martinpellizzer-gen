    "intro": "Vernonia cirrifera, commonly known as the featherleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Vernonia cirrifera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
