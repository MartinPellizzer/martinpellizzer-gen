    "intro": "Vicia grandiflora var. sordida, commonly known as the gloomy broadleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are less showy compared to other vetch species. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that mature to a reddish-brown color. This variety is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine or steppe habitats."
