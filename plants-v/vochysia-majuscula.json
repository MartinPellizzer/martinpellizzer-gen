    "intro": "Vochysia majuscula, commonly known as the giant velvetleaf, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become an invasive species in certain regions."
