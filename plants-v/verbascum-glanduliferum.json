    "intro": "Verbascum glanduliferum, commonly known as the sticky mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, upright spikes. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to dry environments. Verbascum glanduliferum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
