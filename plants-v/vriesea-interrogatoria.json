    "intro": "Vriesea interrogatoria, commonly known as the Spiky Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. Vriesea interrogatoria is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
