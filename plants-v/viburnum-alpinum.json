    "intro": "Viburnum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, upright growth with dark green, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
