    "intro": "Virgularia campestris, commonly known as the field gentian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Virgularia campestris is often found in open habitats and is considered a characteristic species of dry, sunny environments."
