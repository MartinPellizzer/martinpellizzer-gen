It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes a wide variety of orchids, and is characterized by its delicate, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and often pale in color, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
