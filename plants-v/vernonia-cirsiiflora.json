    "intro": "Vernonia cirsiiflora, commonly known as the rough vervain, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually yellow or orange and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
