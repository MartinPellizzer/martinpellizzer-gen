    "intro": "Veronica wormskjoldii f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered wormskjold's speedwell, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Norway. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, terminal spikes, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is notable for its unique coloration and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and ornamental value."
