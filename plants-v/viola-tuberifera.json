    "intro": "Viola tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces delicate violet flowers with five petals. The plant is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and help it survive in less favorable conditions. Viola tuberifera thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
