    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. linearifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, usually blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along field margins. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
