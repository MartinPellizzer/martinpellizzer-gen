    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum f. langeanum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to wet, acidic soils in northern regions. It produces small, dark blue berries that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of the common blueberry. The plant has elongated, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. It thrives in boggy or swampy environments and is often found in heathlands and peat bogs. This form is considered a natural variant of the broader Vaccinium uliginosum species."
