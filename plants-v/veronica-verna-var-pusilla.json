    "intro": "Veronica verna var. pusilla, commonly known as the small blue speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the broader Veronica genus, which includes many species with similar floral characteristics."
