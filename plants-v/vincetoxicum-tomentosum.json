    "intro": "Vincetoxicum tomentosum, commonly known as the fuzzy elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compound leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, making it an important plant for wildlife but requiring caution in cultivation."
