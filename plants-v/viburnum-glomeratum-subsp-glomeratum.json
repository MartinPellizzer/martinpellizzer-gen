It features small, white, clustered flowers that appear in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, flowers, and berries, making it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
