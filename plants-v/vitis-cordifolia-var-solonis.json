    "intro": "Vitis cordifolia var. solonis, commonly known as the Solon's heartleaf grape, is a variant of the heartleaf grapevine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, dark blue berries. The plant is a deciduous vine that thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks. Its botanical features include tendrils for climbing and a complex root system that helps stabilize soil. The berries are edible but are typically used in local foraging and traditional practices rather than commercial agriculture."
