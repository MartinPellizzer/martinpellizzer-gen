    "intro": "Valeriana dageletiana f. integra, commonly known as the Dageletian valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a robust rhizomatous root system and lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
