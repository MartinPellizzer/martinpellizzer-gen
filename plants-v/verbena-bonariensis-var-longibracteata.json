    "intro": "Verbena bonariensis var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety longibracteata is distinguished by its elongated bracts, which are leaf-like structures that surround the flower clusters. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. It is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
