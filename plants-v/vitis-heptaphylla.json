    "intro": "Vitis heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf grapevine, is a rare and ancient species native to the arid regions of central and western China. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including the presence of seven leaves per node, which is a distinguishing trait among the Vitis genus. This plant thrives in extreme desert environments, showcasing remarkable adaptations to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its berries are small and typically dark in color, and while not widely cultivated, it holds ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, Vitis heptaphylla is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
