    "intro": "Verbesina tiburonensis, commonly known as Tiburon beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces slender, hooked seeds that can attach to clothing or animals, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast and is often found in dunes or disturbed areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in some parts of its range."
