    "intro": "Viola rupestris subsp. relicta, commonly known as the relic violet, is a rare and endangered species native to the rocky habitats of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in limestone or sandstone soils. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often marked with a distinctive yellow or white blotch. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
