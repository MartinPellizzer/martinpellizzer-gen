    "intro": "Viguiera pilicaulis, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Viguiera pilicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
