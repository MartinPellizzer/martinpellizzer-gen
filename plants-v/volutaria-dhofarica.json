    "intro": "Volutaria dhofarica, commonly known as the Dhofar star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in arid, rocky environments. It is typically found in the coastal regions of Oman and Yemen. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
