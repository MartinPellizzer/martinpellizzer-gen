    "intro": "Viburnum hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, flowering display, and seasonal fruiting."
