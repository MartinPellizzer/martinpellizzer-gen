    "intro": "Vaccinium corymbosum f. typicum, commonly known as blueberry, is a wild, low-growing shrub native to North America. It produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and vitamins. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and its flowers are bell-shaped, typical of the Ericaceae family. This form is the standard wild type, often used as a parent plant in breeding programs for cultivated blueberries."
