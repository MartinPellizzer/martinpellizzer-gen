    "intro": "Viscum granulosum, commonly known as the granular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and yellowish-white berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to regions of southern Africa, including South Africa and Namibia. Viscum granulosum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries."
