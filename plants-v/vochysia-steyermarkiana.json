It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
