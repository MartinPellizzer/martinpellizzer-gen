    "intro": "Viscum filipendulum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and apple trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of sticky seeds by birds, which adhere to the bark of host trees. Viscum filipendulum has been historically associated with festive traditions and has cultural significance in many European countries."
