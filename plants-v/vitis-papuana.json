    "intro": "Vitis papuana, commonly known as the Papuan grapevine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a woody vine that typically grows along coastal areas and in humid tropical environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Vitis papuana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
