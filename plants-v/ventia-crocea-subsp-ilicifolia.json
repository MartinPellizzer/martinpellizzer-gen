    "intro": "Ventia crocea subsp. ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing on sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought."
