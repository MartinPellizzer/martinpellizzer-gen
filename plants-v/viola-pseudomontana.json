    "intro": "Viola pseudomontana, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of violet or purple flowers in early spring. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often marked with a distinctive yellow or white spot. Viola pseudomontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
