    "intro": "Vicia sativa f. platysperma, commonly known as the broad-seeded vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its broader and more robust seed pods. This plant is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in temperate regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The broad-seeded form is notable for its larger, more elongated seeds compared to the typical variety. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
