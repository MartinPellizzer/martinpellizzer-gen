    "intro": "Verbena clavata, commonly known as the clustered verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Verbena clavata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
