    "intro": "Vanilla dungsii, commonly known as the dwarf vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It produces fragrant, dark green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's flowers are small and typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle vanilla scent. Vanilla dungsii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique fragrance and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both ornamental and therapeutic purposes."
