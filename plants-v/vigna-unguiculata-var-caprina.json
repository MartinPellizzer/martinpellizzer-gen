It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to warm climates and is often grown as a summer crop. It has a deep root system that helps improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, and it is an important source of protein in many tropical regions."
