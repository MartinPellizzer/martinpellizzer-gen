    "intro": "Vaccinium myrtillus subsp. myrtillus, commonly known as blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into blue-black berries, which are rich in antioxidants and nutrients. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. Its leaves are oval and dark green, with a leathery texture, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The plant is valued both for its edible fruits and its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
