    "intro": "Valerianella ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"snow lettuce,\" is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Valerianella ovczinnikovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a hardy garden plant."
