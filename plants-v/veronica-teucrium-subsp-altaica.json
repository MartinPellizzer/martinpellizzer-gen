It is a low-growing perennial herb with dark green, ovate leaves and blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer.

Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine displays. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
