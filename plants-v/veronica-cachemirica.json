    "intro": "Veronica cachemirica, commonly known as the Kashmir speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue or violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing small, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Veronica cachemirica is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in cooler climates."
