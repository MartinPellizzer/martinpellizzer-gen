    "intro": "Vitis motleyi, commonly known as Motley's grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in rocky soils and canyons. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are usually lobed and have a rough texture, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Vitis motleyi is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh conditions."
