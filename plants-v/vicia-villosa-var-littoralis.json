    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by lens-shaped pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and coastal dunes. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
