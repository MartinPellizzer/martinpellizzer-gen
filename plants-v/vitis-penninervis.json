    "intro": "Vitis penninervis, commonly known as the Mexican grapevine, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are palmately arranged and have a distinct, slender vein pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by clusters of round, edible berries. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Vitis penninervis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
