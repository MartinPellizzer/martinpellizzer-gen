    "intro": "Vitex lomiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Vitex genus within the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a rough texture. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Vitex lomiensis is often found in coastal and lowland areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
