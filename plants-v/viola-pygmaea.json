    "intro": "Viola pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it one of the smallest species in the viola genus. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects."
