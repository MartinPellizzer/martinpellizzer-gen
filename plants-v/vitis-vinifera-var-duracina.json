    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. duracina, commonly known as the Duracina grape, is a lesser-known variety of Vitis vinifera, the species that includes most wine and table grapes. It is characterized by its small, dark-colored berries and a unique, complex flavor profile that includes notes of spice and earthiness. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and requires a long growing season with adequate sunlight. It is relatively resistant to some diseases but is sensitive to extreme weather conditions. Due to its rarity, it is primarily cultivated in specialized vineyards for niche wine production."
