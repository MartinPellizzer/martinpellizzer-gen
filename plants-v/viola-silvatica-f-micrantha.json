The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in the undergrowth of deciduous forests. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
