    "intro": "Verbesina aestuans, commonly known as the seaside thistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize coastal environments. Verbesina aestuans is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
