    "intro": "Viticella parviflora var. plaskettii, commonly known as the Plaskett's ivy, is a compact, trailing evergreen vine native to South Africa. It features small, dark green leaves that are glossy and oval in shape, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its vigorous growth habit. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and delicate floral display, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
