    "intro": "Votschia nemophila, commonly known as the bog lichen, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in cool, moist environments such as bogs and heathlands. It is a member of the Rhexadiscaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with algae, which contributes to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellowish, and it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils. Due to habitat loss, Votschia nemophila is considered endangered in many regions."
