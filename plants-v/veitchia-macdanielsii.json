    "intro": "Veitchia macdanielsii, commonly known as the MacDaniels' cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
