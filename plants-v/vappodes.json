    "intro": "Vappodes, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Vappodes is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread across wetland habitats."
