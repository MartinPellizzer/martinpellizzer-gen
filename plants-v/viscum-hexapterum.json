    "intro": "Viscum hexapterum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by birds. Its evergreen foliage remains throughout the year, giving it a distinctive appearance in winter. Viscum hexapterum plays an important ecological role in supporting various bird species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
