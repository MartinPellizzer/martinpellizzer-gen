    "intro": "Vicia sinkiangensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang vetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Vicia sinkiangensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life in its native habitat."
