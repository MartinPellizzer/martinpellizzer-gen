    "intro": "Vesicaria fendleri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Vesicaria fendleri plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
