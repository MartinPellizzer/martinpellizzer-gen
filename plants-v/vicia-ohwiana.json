    "intro": "Vicia ohwiana, commonly known as the Japanese vetch, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Vicia ohwiana is often found in forest understories and along streambanks, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
