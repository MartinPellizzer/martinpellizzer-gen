    "intro": "Viola meyeriana, commonly known as the Meyer's violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and produces showy flowers in shades of purple and violet during the spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters, with a compact and bushy growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in natural habitats."
