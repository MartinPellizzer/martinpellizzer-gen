    "intro": "Verbesina arnottii var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its hairy stems and leaves, it is often mistaken for other species in the genus Verbesina."
