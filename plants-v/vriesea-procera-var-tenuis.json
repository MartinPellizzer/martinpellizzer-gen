    "intro": "Vriesea procera var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a hybrid of the genus Vriesea native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green stripes. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
