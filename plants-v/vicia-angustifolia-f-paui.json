It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and elongated, cylindrical pods. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, yellowish-white flowers."
