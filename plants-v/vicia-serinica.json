    "intro": "Vicia serinica, commonly known as the silver vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the genus Vicia. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a climbing habit due to its twining stems. Vicia serinica is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
