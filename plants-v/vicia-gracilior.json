    "intro": "Vicia gracilior, commonly known as slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Vicia gracilior is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
