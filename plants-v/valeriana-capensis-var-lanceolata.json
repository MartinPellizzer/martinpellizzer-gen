    "intro": "Valeriana capensis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with fine, hairy pubescence. The leaves are lanceolate, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers in spikes during the summer months. The plant is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, and it has a strong, somewhat medicinal scent."
