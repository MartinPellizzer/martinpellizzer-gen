It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
