    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved grapevine, is a lesser-known variety of the grapevine species. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to other Vitis vinifera cultivars. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It produces small clusters of grapes that are typically not used for commercial winemaking but are valued for their unique flavor profiles in specialty wines. Due to its limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure variety within the broader Vitis vinifera family."
