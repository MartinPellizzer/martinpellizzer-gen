    "intro": "Vincetoxicum indicum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a perennial shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and has been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though caution is advised due to its poisonous nature."
