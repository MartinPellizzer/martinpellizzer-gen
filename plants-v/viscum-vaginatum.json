    "intro": "Viscum vaginatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and apples. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture. Viscum vaginatum plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations and maintaining forest biodiversity."
