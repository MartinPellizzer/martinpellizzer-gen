    "intro": "Vinticena rugosifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved vinticena, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rugged, textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the dry season. Vinticena rugosifolia typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical research and horticulture."
