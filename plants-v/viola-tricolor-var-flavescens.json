    "intro": "Viola tricolor var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and have a deep green upper surface with a lighter underside. The flowers are typically violet or purple, though the variety flavescens often exhibits a more yellowish hue, especially in the center. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
