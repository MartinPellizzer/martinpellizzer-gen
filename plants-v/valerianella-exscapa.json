    "intro": "Valerianella exscapa, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pinkish flowers and has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is known for its mild, slightly peppery scent. Valerianella exscapa is also sometimes used in herbal remedies for its purported calming effects."
