    "intro": "Vaccinium oranjense var. marginellum, commonly known as the Orange Vaccinium, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or orange margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. These flowers give way to bright red berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or shaded environments."
