    "intro": "Viburnum stellatopilosum, commonly known as the starry-hairy viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
