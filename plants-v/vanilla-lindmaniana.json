    "intro": "Vanilla lindmaniana, commonly known as the Lindman's vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the highland regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant produces fragrant, dark brown pods that contain the aromatic vanilla extract used in culinary applications. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
