    "intro": "Voyara, commonly known as the yellow brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale yellow to golden florets. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in open fields and disturbed soils. Voyara is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
