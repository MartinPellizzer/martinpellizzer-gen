    "intro": "Vernonia pohliana, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in various habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Vernonia pohliana is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, where it adds vibrant color to the landscape during the summer months."
