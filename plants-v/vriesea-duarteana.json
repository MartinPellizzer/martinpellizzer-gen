    "intro": "Vriesea duarteana, commonly known as the Duarte's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vriesea duarteana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
