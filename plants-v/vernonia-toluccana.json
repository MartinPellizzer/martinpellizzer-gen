It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, yellow-orange, and arranged in dense clusters. Vernonia toluccana is often used in traditional medicine and is also a valuable plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
