It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated capsule that splits open to release seeds. Viola macroceras is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
