It features slender, erect stems that are typically covered in a distinctive ash-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
