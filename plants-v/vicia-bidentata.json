    "intro": "Vicia bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with two small, toothed lobes on each leaflet. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, bean-shaped pods containing several seeds. Vicia bidentata is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. It is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
