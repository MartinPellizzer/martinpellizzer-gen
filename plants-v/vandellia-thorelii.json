    "intro": "Vandellia thorelii, commonly known as the Thorelli's vandellia, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white with a faint fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
