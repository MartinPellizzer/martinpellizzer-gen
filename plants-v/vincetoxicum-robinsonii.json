    "intro": "Vincetoxicum robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. Its leaves are typically ovate with prominent veins, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Vincetoxicum robinsonii is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
