    "intro": "Viguiera sharpii, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, lavender-pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Viguiera sharpii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
