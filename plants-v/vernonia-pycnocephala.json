    "intro": "Vernonia pycnocephala, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for native gardens. The flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
