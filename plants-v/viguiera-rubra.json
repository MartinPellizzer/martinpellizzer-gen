    "intro": "Viguiera rubra, commonly known as Mexican heather, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, while its flowers range in color from white to pink and bloom in late summer. Viguiera rubra is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
