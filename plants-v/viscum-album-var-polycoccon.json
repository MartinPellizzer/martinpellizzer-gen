    "intro": "Viscum album var. polycoccon, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by spherical berries containing sticky seeds. Its evergreen foliage provides a dense canopy, and it is often associated with traditional holiday customs. The species is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in herbal medicine for centuries."
