    "intro": "Vincetoxicum clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vincetoxicum clemensiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
