    "intro": "Viola obscura, commonly known as the dark violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to parts of North America, particularly the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
