    "intro": "Vriesea eltoniana, commonly known as the Elton's Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, with a central yellow stripe, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Vriesea eltoniana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
