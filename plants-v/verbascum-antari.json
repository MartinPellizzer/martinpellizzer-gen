    "intro": "Verbascum antari, commonly known as the Antari mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes species known for their fuzzy, woolly leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
