    "intro": "Vanilla griffithii var. ronoensis, commonly known as the Rona vanilla, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Rona in the North Atlantic. This plant is characterized by its climbing habit and the production of fragrant, dark brown vanilla pods, which are used in perfumery and flavoring. It thrives in humid, coastal environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. The plant's flowers are typically yellowish-green with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
