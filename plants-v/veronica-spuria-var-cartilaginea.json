    "intro": "Veronica spuria var. cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with thin, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its leaves are lance-shaped and may have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine environments."
