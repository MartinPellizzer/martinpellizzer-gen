    "intro": "Viola diamantiaca var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved diamond violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring heart-shaped, glabrous (smooth) leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, slightly fragrant aroma. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and early spring blooming period."
