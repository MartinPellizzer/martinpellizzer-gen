It features upright, branching stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Veronica petiolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
