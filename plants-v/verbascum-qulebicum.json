    "intro": "Verbascum qulebicum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a similar fuzzy coating. Verbascum qulebicum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
