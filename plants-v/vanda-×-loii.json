    "intro": "Vanda \u00d7 loii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a fascinating plant with unique botanical features. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is a cross between Vanda coerulea and Vanda teres. This hybrid is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically come in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its pseudobulbs and long, strap-like leaves are adaptations that help it store water and nutrients in its native habitat."
