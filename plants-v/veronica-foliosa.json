    "intro": "Veronica foliosa, commonly known as the leafy veronica, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Veronica foliosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
