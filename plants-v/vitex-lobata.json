It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces showy, clustered blue or purple flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, woody fruits called drupes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges and dry habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
