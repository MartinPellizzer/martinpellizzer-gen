    "intro": "Veronicastrum alpinum, commonly known as alpine blueweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, adorned with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
