    "intro": "Vitaliana primuliflora var. praetutiana, commonly known as the Praetutian primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
