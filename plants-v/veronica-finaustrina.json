    "intro": "Veronica finaustrina, commonly known as the coastal veronica, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along coastal areas. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Veronica finaustrina is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
