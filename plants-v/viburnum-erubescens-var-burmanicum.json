    "intro": "Viburnum erubescens var. burmanicum, commonly known as Burman's snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It features compound, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and colorful berries, which attract birds and add visual interest to gardens."
