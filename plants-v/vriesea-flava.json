    "intro": "Vriesea flava, commonly known as the yellow vriesea, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea flava is relatively low maintenance, making it an ideal choice for indoor gardening."
