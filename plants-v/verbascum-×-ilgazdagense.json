    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 ilgazdagense, commonly known as the Ilgaz hybrid mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Turkey. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes several species of mullein known for their fuzzy, woolly leaves. The plant features tall, erect stems with large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy tissue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
