    "intro": "Vulpia geniculata var. breviglumis, commonly known as the short-awned bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in short awns, which aid in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats."
