    "intro": "Viburnum lantana var. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
