    "intro": "Vicia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale pink or white, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Vicia rigidula is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or gravelly habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
