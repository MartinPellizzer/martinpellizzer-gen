    "intro": "Viola flavicornis var. montana, commonly known as the mountain violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces showy violet-blue flowers with five petals, often with a yellow throat, during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forested areas. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
