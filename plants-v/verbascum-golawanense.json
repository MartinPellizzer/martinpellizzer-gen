    "intro": "Verbascum golawanense, commonly known as the Golawane mullein, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
