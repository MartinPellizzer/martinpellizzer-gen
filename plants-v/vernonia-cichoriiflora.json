    "intro": "Vernonia cichoriiflora, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters tall, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to the chicory plant and its association with the Vernonia genus. Vernonia cichoriiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
