    "intro": "Verbascum peraffine, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. Verbascum peraffine is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, thriving in full sun."
