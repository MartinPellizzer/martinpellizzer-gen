    "intro": "Veronica algida, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps retain moisture in harsh conditions. Veronica algida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging, high-altitude habitats."
