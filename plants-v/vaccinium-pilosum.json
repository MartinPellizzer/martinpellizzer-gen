    "intro": "Vaccinium pilosum, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acidic soil-loving plants. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are typically covered in a whitish bloom, giving it its common name. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its rugged appearance. Vaccinium pilosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
