    "intro": "Vernonia lithospermoides, commonly known as the rock vernonia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suited to dry environments. Its fibrous root system helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
