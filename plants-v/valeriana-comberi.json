    "intro": "Valeriana comberi, commonly known as the creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, somewhat succulent stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Valeriana comberi is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
