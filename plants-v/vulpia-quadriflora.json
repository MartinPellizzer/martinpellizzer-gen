    "intro": "Vulpia quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered veldtgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often lie flat on the ground, and its leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is usually surrounded by four bracts, giving it its common name. Vulpia quadriflora produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
