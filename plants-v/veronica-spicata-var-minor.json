    "intro": "Veronica spicata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spike speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This variety is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
