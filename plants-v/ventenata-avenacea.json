    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vetenata avenacea, commonly known as yellow toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
