    "intro": "Varronia calyptrata var. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's varronia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color and bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
