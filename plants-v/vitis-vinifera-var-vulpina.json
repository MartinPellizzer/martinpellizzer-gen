    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. vulpina, commonly known as the fox grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, tart berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and is often grown in temperate climates. The plant has vigorous vines that can climb or sprawl, and it produces clusters of berries that are sometimes used in local winemaking or as a food source for wildlife. Its botanical features make it distinct from more widely cultivated grape varieties."
