It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Viburnum indianense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. It is also noted for its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to pests and diseases."
