    "intro": "Vaccinium angustifolium var. integrifolium, commonly known as the northern highbush blueberry, is a variant of the common blueberry native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically entire, lacking the serrated edges found in other varieties. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into the familiar blue-black berries, which are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest regions. This variety is cultivated for its fruit, which is prized for its flavor and nutritional value."
