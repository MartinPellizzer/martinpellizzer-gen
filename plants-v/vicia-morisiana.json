    "intro": "Vicia morisiana, commonly known as the Morisian vetch, is a flowering plant species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the spring. Vicia morisiana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
