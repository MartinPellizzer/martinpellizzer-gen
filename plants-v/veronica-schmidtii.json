    "intro": "Veronica schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Veronica schmidtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
