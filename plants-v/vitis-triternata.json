    "intro": "Vitis triternata, commonly known as the three-lobed grapevine, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a perennial vine that produces small, clustered flowers and red or black berries. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its ability to climb using tendrils. Vitis triternata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
