    "intro": "Viscum oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it is often found in temperate and subtropical regions. Viscum oblongifolium plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
