    "intro": "Veronica satureiifolia, commonly known as the coastal veronica, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy coastal areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
