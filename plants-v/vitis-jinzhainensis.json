    "intro": "Vitis jinzhainensis, commonly known as the Jinzhain vine, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
