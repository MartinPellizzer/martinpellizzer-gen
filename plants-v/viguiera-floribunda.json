    "intro": "Viguiera floribunda, commonly known as Mexican ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant features finely dissected, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fuzzy coating. Viguiera floribunda thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. Its ecological value includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
