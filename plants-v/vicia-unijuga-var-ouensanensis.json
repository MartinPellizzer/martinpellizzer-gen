    "intro": "Vicia unijuga var. ouensanensis, commonly known as the Ouensanensis vetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
