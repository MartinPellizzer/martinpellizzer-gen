    "intro": "Valerianella lusitanica, commonly known as mouse whiskers, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features small, bright green, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Valerianella lusitanica thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, carpet-like foliage."
