The plant produces vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that resemble a parrot's beak. Its foliage is often variegated with yellow and green patterns, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media."
