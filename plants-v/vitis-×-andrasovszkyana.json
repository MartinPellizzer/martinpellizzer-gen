    "intro": "Vitis \u00d7 andrasovszkyana, commonly known as the Andrasovszkyana grape, is a naturally occurring hybrid of Vitis vinifera and Vitis riparia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and semi-woody vines, often found in the Carpathian Basin. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. It is valued for its potential in viticulture due to its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other grape varieties due to its lower commercial yield and specific growing requirements."
