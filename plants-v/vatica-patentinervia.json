    "intro": "Vatica patentinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves with prominently visible veins. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable timber and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
