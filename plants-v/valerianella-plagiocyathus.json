    "intro": "Valerianella plagiocyathus, commonly known as the common valerian, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, clustered leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. The plant produces tiny, pale green or white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Valerianella plagiocyathus is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds like valerenal. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including gardens and roadsides."
