    "intro": "Vittaria hirta, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, producing spores for propagation. Vittaria hirta is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
