It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its roots are fibrous and deep. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
