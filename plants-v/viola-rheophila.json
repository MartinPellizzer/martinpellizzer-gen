    "intro": "Viola rheophila, commonly known as the stream viol, is a rare flowering plant native to moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Viola rheophila is often found in montane and subalpine regions, where it adapts to the unique microclimates of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental health."
