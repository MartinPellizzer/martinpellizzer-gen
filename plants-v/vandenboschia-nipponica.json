It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
