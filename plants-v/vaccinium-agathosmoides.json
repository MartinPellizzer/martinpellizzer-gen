    "intro": "Vaccinium agathosmoides, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens and conservation areas."
