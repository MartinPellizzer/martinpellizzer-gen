It features small, clustered leaves and tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.
