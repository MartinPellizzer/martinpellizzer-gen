    "intro": "Veronica repens var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Valley speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is adapted to high-altitude regions and is often found in open meadows and along stream banks in the Sierra Nevada."
