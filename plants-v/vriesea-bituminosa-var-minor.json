    "intro": "Vriesea bituminosa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf vriesea, is a compact bromeliad native to South America. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bituminous coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red and orange bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
