    "intro": "Valeriana daphniflora, commonly known as the silverleaf valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters called cymes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and have a slightly aromatic scent. Valeriana daphniflora is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments."
