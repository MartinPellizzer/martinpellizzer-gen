It is native to specific regions in Asia, particularly in parts of China and India, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and shrubs. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. The fruit, though not widely cultivated, is edible and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
