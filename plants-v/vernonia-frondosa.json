    "intro": "Vernonia frondosa, commonly known as the fronded ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, upright growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its showy purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia frondosa is often found in moist to wet soils in woodland and swampy areas."
