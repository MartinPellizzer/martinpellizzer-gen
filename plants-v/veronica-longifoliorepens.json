    "intro": "Veronica longifoliorepens, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has prostrate stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats and helping to suppress weeds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Veronica longifoliorepens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
