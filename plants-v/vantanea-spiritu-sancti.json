It is characterized by its striking violet petals and a unique fragrance reminiscent of citrus and spice. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating. Vantanea spiritu-sancti is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
