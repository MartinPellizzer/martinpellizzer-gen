    "intro": "Volkeranthus clandestinus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
