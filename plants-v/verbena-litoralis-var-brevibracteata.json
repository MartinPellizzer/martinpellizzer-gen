    "intro": "Verbena litoralis var. brevibracteata, commonly known as the coastal verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to the salty, windy coastal environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its compact growth habit and vibrant flowers make it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinators."
