    "intro": "Vernonanthura perangusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vernonanthura, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct venation pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
