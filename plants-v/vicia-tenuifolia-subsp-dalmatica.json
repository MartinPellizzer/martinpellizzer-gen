It features slender, trifoliate leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its seed pods are slender and contain several small, elongated seeds.
