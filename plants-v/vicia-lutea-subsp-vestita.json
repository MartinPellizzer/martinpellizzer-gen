    "intro": "Vicia lutea subsp. vestita, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with yellowish-green leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
