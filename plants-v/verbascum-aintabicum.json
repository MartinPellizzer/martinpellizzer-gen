    "intro": "Verbascum aintabicum, commonly known as the Aintab mullein, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes species known for their fuzzy, woolly leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are densely covered in soft, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
