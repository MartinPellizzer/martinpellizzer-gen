    "intro": "Vriesea woodsoniana, commonly known as the Woodson's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, glossy, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant orange and red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea woodsoniana is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in indoor settings."
