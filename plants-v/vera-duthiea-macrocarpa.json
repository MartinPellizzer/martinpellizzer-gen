It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 6 feet in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
