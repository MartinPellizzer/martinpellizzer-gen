It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are blue-black in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential as a food source."
