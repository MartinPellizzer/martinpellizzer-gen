It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, dark berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
