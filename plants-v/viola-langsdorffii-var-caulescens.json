It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental species in horticultural collections."
