    "intro": "Viscum verrucosum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various trees and shrubs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by birds that eat the berries. Viscum verrucosum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and supporting various wildlife species."
