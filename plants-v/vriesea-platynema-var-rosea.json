    "intro": "Vriesea platynema var. rosea, commonly known as the pink-veined Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, rosette-shaped leaves that are dark green with prominent pink or red veins. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
