    "intro": "Viola oblonga, commonly known as the oblong violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet hue and produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Viola oblonga is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
