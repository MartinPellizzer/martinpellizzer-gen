    "intro": "Vulpia delicatula var. gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum vulpia, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those containing gypsum, which influences its distribution. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
