    "intro": "Veronica pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, alpine environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a hardy ground cover."
