    "intro": "Viola deminuta, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple or violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release seeds by spring breezes. Viola deminuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
