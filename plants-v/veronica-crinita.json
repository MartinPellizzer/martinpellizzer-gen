    "intro": "Veronica crinita, commonly known as the silky veronica, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and extended flowering period."
