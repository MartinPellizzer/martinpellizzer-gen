    "intro": "Vincetoxicum utriculosum, commonly known as the bladderleaf agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, opposite leaves that are often gland-dotted and have a distinctive bladdery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed, bladder-like capsule that splits open to release seeds. Vincetoxicum utriculosum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
