It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Vicia cavanillesii is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments."
