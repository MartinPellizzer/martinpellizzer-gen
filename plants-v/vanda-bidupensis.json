    "intro": "Vanda bidupensis, commonly known as the orchid of the highlands, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in clusters. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Vanda bidupensis thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light."
