    "intro": "Viola inconspicua, commonly known as the inconspicuous violet, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing herb with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, pale violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often overlooked due to their modest size and color. Viola inconspicua thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
