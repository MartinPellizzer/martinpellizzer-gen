    "intro": "Vernonia graniticola, commonly known as the granite vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia graniticola is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, making it a distinctive feature of its native habitat."
