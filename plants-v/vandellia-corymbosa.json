    "intro": "Vandellia corymbosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Vandellia corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
