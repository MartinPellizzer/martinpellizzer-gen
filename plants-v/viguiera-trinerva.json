    "intro": "Viguiera trinerva, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is aromatic and can be used in traditional medicine. Viguiera trinerva produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
