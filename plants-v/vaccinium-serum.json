    "intro": "Vaccinium serum, commonly known as the common blueberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, blue-black berries in the summer. Vaccinium serum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its berries are not only a food source for wildlife but also widely cultivated for human consumption."
