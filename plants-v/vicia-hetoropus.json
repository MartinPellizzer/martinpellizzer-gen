    "intro": "Vicia hetoropus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, and its long, slender pods that contain several small, bean-like seeds. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in agricultural settings for soil enrichment. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Vicia hetoropus is also notable for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage crop for livestock."
