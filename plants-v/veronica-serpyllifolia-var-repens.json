    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia var. repens, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
