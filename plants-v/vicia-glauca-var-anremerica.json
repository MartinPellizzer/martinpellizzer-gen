It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with trifoliate leaves consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots form nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its ecological benefits."
