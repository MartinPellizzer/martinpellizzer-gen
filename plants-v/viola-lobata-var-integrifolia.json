    "intro": "Viola lobata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a smooth, uninterrupted margin, which distinguishes it from other viola species. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive spur. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine and are also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
