    "intro": "Vicia nigra, commonly known as black vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to almost white. Vicia nigra is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
