    "intro": "Veronica gemundiana, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant typically blooms from June to August, producing numerous tiny flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. Veronica gemundiana thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands."
