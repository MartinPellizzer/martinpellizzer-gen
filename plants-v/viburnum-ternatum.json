    "intro": "Viburnum ternatum, commonly known as the three-leaved viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the fall. Viburnum ternatum typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and supporting local wildlife."
