    "intro": "Veronica diosmoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Veronica diosmoides is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
