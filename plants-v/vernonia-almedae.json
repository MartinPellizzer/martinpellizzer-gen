    "intro": "Vernonia almedae, commonly known as the Almeda's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, spike-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia almedae is often found in desert grasslands and is an important species for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
