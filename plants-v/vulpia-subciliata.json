    "intro": "Vulpia subciliata, commonly known as the slender vulpia, is a grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual plant that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are followed by narrow, bristle-like seeds. Vulpia subciliata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
