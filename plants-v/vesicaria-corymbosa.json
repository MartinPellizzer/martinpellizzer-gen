    "intro": "Vesicaria corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates for nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. Vesicaria corymbosa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
