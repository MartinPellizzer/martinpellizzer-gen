    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. puberula, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The leaves are typically covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. This plant is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and its capacity to suppress weeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climatic conditions."
