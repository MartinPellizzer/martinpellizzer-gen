    "intro": "Valeriana cespitosa, commonly known as narrow-leaved valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter tall, covered with small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from June to August. Its roots are aromatic and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their calming properties. Valeriana cespitosa thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
