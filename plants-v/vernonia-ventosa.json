The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are pale yellow to brownish in color. Vernonia ventosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
