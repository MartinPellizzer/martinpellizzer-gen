    "intro": "Vriesea serrana, commonly known as the serrated vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea serrana is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and prolonged blooming period."
