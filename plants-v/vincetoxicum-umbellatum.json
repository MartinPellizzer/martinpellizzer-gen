    "intro": "Vincetoxicum umbellatum, commonly known as the clustered snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Vincetoxicum umbellatum is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
