    "intro": "Vernonanthura almedae, commonly known as the Almeda's vernal bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shrubland habitats. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Vernonanthura almedae plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical research due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
