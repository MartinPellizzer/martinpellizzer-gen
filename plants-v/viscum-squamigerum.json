    "intro": "Viscum squamigerum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a dense, scaly layer. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by birds. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host. Viscum squamigerum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird species."
