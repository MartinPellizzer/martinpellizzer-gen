    "intro": "Vriesea crenulipetala, commonly known as the golden crown vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a crown, often displaying shades of yellow and orange. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to its appearance. Vriesea crenulipetala thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
