    "intro": "Vieusseuxia tristis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive, graceful appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes."
