    "intro": "Vanilla griffithii, commonly known as the giant vanilla or giant orchid, is a tropical climbing orchid native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces fragrant, vanilla-scented pods that are similar in appearance to the more well-known vanilla planifolia. These pods are not typically used for vanilla extraction but are valued for their ornamental beauty and unique fragrance. Vanilla griffithii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation due to its specific environmental needs."
