    "intro": "Verbascum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Verbascum alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
