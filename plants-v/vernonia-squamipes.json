    "intro": "Vernonia squamipes, commonly known as the wooly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia squamipes is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
