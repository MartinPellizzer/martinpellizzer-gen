    "intro": "Veratrum officinale, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, smooth, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels at the top of the stem. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a waxy texture with a distinct bitter taste. The plant contains various toxic alkaloids, making it dangerous if ingested, though it has been historically used in traditional medicine."
