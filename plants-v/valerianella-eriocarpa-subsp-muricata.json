    "intro": "Valerianella eriocarpa subsp. muricata, commonly known as the rough valerian, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Valerianella eriocarpa subsp. muricata is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas."
