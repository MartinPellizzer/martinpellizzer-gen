    "intro": "Vicia amoena f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sweet vetch, is a variant of the sweet vetch species native to southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are predominantly white, distinguishing it from the typical purple-flowered form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
