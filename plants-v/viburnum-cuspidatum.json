    "intro": "Viburnum cuspidatum, commonly known as arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are opposite and ovate, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Viburnum cuspidatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and supporting local wildlife."
