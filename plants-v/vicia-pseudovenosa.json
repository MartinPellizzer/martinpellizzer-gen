    "intro": "Vicia pseudovenosa, commonly known as the false vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. Its pods contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Vicia pseudovenosa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
