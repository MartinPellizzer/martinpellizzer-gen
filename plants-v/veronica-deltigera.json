    "intro": "Veronica deltigera, commonly known as the narrowleaf speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas. Its delicate appearance and ability to spread via stolons make it a common sight in moist meadows and stream banks."
