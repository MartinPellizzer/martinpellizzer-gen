    "intro": "Vicia subcuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Vicia subcuspidata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
