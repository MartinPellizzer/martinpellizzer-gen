    "intro": "Valerianella locusta var. dunensis, commonly known as the dwarf valerian, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with tiny, clustered leaves and small white or pinkish flowers that appear in the summer. The plant is characterized by its distinct, aromatic scent, which is often described as similar to that of valerian. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens or along the edges of woodland areas. This variety is known for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
