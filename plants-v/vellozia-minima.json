    "intro": "Vellozia minima, commonly known as the dwarf vellozia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern. Vellozia minima is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. It is also notable for its unique leaf structure, which contributes to its ability to reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
