    "intro": "Vernonia cinerea subsp. vialis, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
