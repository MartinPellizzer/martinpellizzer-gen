    "intro": "Vernonia trachyphylla, commonly known as roughleaf ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration. The genus Vernonia is part of the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is known for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
