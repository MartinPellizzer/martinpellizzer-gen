    "intro": "Viola patrinii, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Viola patrinii has a compact growth habit and often forms dense mats, which help it survive in harsh mountain conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to high-altitude landscapes."
