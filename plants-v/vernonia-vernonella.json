    "intro": "Vernonia vernonella, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 2 to 3 feet tall, characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled spheres that are often mistaken for cotton balls, which aid in wind pollination. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vernonia vernonella thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland areas."
