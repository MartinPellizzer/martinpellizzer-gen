    "intro": "Verbascum arbusculum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of silky hairs. Verbascum arbusculum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
