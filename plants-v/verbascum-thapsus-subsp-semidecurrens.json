It features tall, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or semi-prostrate, giving it a creeping growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green to reddish bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This subspecies is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
