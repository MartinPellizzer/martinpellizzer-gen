    "intro": "Vilfa asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved vilfa, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Vilfa asperifolia is often found in high-altitude grasslands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
