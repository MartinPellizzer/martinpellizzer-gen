    "intro": "Veronica surculosa, commonly known as the woolly speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, blue to violet flowers clustered in pairs. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Veronica surculosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
