    "intro": "Valerianella mixta, commonly known as garden sorrel, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in gardens and along stream banks. Valerianella mixta is valued both for its culinary uses and as a decorative plant in landscaping."
