    "intro": "Verbena veronicifolia, commonly known as the blue verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Verbena veronicifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
