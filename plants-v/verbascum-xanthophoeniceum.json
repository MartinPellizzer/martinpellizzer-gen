It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, soft, fuzzy leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Verbascum xanthophoeniceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its medicinal properties."
