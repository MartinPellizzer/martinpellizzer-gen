    "intro": "Vernonia almasensis, commonly known as the Almas ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia almasensis is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient species in harsh environmental conditions."
