    "intro": "Vicia americana, commonly known as the American vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it plays a role in improving soil fertility."
