It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in ponds, ditches, and stream edges. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This variety is notable for its adaptability to aquatic environments and its role in supporting local insect populations."
