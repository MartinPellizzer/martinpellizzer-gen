    "intro": "Virola venosa var. martii, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a species of tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its density and workability. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a straight trunk with a broad, umbrella-like canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in the ecological dynamics of the rainforest."
