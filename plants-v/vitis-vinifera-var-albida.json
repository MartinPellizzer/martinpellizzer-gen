    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. albida, commonly known as the white grapevine, is a variety of the common grapevine species characterized by its pale, almost white foliage and fruit. This cultivar is notable for its unique coloration, which differs from the typical green or red hues of other Vitis vinifera varieties. The leaves are often variegated with yellow and white markings, making it a visually striking plant. While primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes, it can also produce small, tart fruits that are occasionally used in winemaking. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and viticulture."
