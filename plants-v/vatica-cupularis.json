    "intro": "Vatica cupularis, commonly known as the cupular nut or cupularia, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its ecological importance and potential for timber use, it is sometimes threatened by deforestation."
