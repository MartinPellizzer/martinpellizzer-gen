    "intro": "Venidium hispidulum, commonly known as the roughleaf venidium, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive pubescent surface. Venidium hispidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
