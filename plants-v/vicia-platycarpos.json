    "intro": "Vicia platycarpos, commonly known as the broad-fruit vetch, is a perennial legume native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 7 to 13 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Vicia platycarpos is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
