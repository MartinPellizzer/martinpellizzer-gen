It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is noted for its relatively small size and adaptation to specific island habitats."
