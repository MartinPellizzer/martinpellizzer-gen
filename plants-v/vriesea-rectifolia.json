    "intro": "Vriesea rectifolia, commonly known as the sword fern bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that are often bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea rectifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
