    "intro": "Vernonia leiocarpa, commonly known as the whitehead ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vernonia leiocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
