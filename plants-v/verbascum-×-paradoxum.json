    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 paradoxum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes species known for their fuzzy, woolly leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The hybrid form results from crosses between Verbascum thapsus and Verbascum blattaria, leading to unique morphological traits. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer."
