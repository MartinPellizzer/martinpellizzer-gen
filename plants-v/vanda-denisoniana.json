    "intro": "Vanda denisoniana, commonly known as the Denison's vanda, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors including white, pink, and red. The plant has long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous blooms, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic growth. Vanda denisoniana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
