    "intro": "Vanda perplexa, commonly known as the perplexing vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda perplexa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience in cultivation."
