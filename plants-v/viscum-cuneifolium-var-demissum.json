    "intro": "Viscum cuneifolium var. demissum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees such as pines and firs. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures that attach to the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and biodiversity. Its unique life cycle involves wind-dispersed seeds that germinate on the foliage of host trees."
