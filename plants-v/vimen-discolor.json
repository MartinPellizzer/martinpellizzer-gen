    "intro": "Vimen discolor, commonly known as the variable maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its variable leaf coloration, ranging from green to red, yellow, or purple depending on the season and environmental conditions. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Vimen discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
