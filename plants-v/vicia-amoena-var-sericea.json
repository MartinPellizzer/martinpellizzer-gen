It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a fine, silky texture that gives the plant its common name. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.
