    "intro": "Verbascum phoeniceum subsp. amplexicaule, commonly known as the purple mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often clasping the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
