    "intro": "Veronica gracilis, commonly known as slender speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged opposite along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Veronica gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
