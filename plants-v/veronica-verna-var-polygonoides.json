It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the genus Veronica, characterized by its spurred petals and medicinal historical uses."
