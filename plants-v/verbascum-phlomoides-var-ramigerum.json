    "intro": "Verbascum phlomoides var. ramigerum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in a fine layer of hair, contributing to its overall fuzzy texture. This plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
