    "intro": "Verbascum mas, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, sparsely branched inflorescence. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of soft, white hairs. Verbascum mas thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
