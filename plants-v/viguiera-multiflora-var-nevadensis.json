    "intro": "Viguiera multiflora var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada bluemink, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a desirable plant for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
