    "intro": "Vanheerdia roodiae, commonly known as the Roodiae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the humid forests of South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, elongated flower spike that resembles a ghostly silhouette. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pollinated by specific species of flies and beetles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vanheerdia roodiae is considered a critically endangered species."
