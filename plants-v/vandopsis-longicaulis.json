    "intro": "Vandopsis longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed vandopsis, is a rare and unique fern-like plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and delicate, compound leaves. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, using its aerial roots to attach to trees and other vegetation. Its foliage is typically green and glossy, with a finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
