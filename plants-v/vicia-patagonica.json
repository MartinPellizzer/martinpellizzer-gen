    "intro": "Vicia patagonica, commonly known as Patagonian vetch, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a perennial legume that grows in grasslands and shrublands, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its seed pods are cylindrical and contain several elliptical seeds. Vicia patagonica plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
