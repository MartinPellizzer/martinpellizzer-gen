    "intro": "Vanilla sprucei, commonly known as the vanilla spruce, is a rare and unique plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces fragrant, vanilla-scented flowers that are highly sought after for their aromatic properties. Despite its name, it is not related to the vanilla orchid but is named for the similar scent of its blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Vanilla sprucei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
