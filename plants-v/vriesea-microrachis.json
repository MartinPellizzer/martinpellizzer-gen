    "intro": "Vriesea microrachis, commonly known as the miniature sword fern, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, pinkish-white bracts that resemble flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
