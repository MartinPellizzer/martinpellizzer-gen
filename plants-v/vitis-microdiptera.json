    "intro": "Vitis microdiptera, commonly known as the small-winged grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its climbing habit and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically followed by small, round berries. Vitis microdiptera is not widely cultivated for its fruit but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential horticultural value. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas."
