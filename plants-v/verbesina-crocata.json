    "intro": "Verbesina crocata, commonly known as the yellow beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its bright yellow flowers and bristly stems. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences. Verbesina crocata thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks."
