    "intro": "Viburnum pichinchense, commonly known as the Pichincha viburnum, is a species of shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely foliated stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Viburnum pichinchense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
