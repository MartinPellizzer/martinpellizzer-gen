    "intro": "Vaccinium laxum, commonly known as the lowbush blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acid-loving plants like heathers and rhododendrons. The plant produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Vaccinium laxum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories where it forms dense thickets."
