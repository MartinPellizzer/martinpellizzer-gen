    "intro": "Vaccinium glaucum, commonly known as the blueberry shrub, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright blue, tart berries in the summer. Vaccinium glaucum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in the production of berries for culinary and commercial purposes."
