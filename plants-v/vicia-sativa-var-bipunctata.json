    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. bipunctata, commonly known as the two-spotted vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear pinnate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. This variety is notable for its distinctive two-spotted pattern on the seed pods, which aids in its identification."
