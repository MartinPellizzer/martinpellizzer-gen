    "intro": "Veronica beccabunga var. muscosa, commonly known as the marsh speedwell, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and ponds. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
