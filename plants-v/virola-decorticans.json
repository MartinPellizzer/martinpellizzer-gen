    "intro": "Virola decorticans, commonly known as the copal tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces a resinous sap that hardens into copal, a substance used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitats."
