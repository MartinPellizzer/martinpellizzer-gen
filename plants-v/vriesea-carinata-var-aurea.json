    "intro": "Vriesea carinata var. aurea, commonly known as the golden Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow bracts that surround the central inflorescence, giving it a dramatic and eye-catching appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. It produces tall, branching flower spikes that bear small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom sequentially over several months. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for lower light conditions and ability to thrive in humid environments."
