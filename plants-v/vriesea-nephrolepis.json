    "intro": "Vriesea nephrolepis, commonly known as the silver queen bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Vriesea nephrolepis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
