    "intro": "Veronica angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Veronica angulata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
