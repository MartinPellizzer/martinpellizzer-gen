    "intro": "Viscum melanocarpum, commonly known as the black-berried mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, dark berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. Its flowers are typically small and white or greenish, and it produces sticky, viscid seeds that adhere to other plants. Viscum melanocarpum is often found in forested areas and is associated with a range of ecological interactions, including bird dispersal of its seeds."
