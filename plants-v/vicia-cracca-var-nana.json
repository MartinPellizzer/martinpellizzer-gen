    "intro": "Vicia cracca var. nana, commonly known as dwarf common vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces slender, yellowish-purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of no more than 20 cm, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
