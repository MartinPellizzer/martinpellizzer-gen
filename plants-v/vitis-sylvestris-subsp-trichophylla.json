    "intro": "Vitis sylvestris subsp. trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy grapevine, is a subspecies native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a coarsely toothed margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of small, edible berries."
