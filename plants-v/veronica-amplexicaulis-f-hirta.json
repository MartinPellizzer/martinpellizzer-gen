    "intro": "Veronica amplexicaulis f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy leaf speedwell, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are opposite, linear, and often clasping the stems, contributing to its unique morphology. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
