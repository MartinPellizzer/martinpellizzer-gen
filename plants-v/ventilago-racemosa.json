    "intro": "Ventilago racemosa, commonly known as the yellow wood or yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The bark is smooth and light-colored, with a fragrant scent when crushed."
