    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and blue-black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
