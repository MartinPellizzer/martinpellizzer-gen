It features erect, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with small, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance.
