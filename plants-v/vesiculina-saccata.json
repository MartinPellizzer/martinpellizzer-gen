It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring bladder-like structures called vesicles that aid in gas exchange. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in freshwater environments. Its leaves are simple and filamentous, while the reproductive structures are borne on specialized stalks. Vesiculina saccata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
