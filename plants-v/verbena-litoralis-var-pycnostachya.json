    "intro": "Verbena litoralis var. pycnostachya, commonly known as the coastal verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dune ecosystems."
