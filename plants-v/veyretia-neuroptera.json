    "intro": "Veyretia neuroptera, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
