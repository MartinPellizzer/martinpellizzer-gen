    "intro": "Vaccinium alainii, commonly known as Alain's blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the wetlands of southeastern Alaska. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
