    "intro": "Viburnum tinus var. hirtum, commonly known as the hairy loropetalum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are slightly hairy, giving it its common name. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its dense, rounded growth habit. Viburnum tinus var. hirtum is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun."
