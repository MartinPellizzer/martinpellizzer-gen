It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Vernonia thorelii is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
