    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. tinctorialis, commonly known as the red grapevine, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, dark red berries that are rich in anthocyanins, giving them their deep color. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its berries have historically been used for natural dye production due to their vibrant pigments. While not widely cultivated for wine, it holds significance in botanical studies and traditional dye-making practices."
