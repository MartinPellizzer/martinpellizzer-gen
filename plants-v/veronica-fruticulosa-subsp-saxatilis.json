It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
