    "intro": "Viburnum venosum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often longer than they are wide, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark red to black berries in the fall. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
