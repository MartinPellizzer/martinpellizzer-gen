    "intro": "Verbena supina var. erecta, commonly known as upright verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies further enhance its horticultural value."
