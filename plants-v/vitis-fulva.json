    "intro": "Vitis fulva, commonly known as the devil's vine, is a deciduous vine native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light green stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet, and sour red berries in the fall. Vitis fulva is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it climbs trees or shrubs. Its berries are a food source for various wildlife, including birds and mammals."
