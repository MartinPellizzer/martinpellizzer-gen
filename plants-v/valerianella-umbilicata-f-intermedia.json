    "intro": "Valerianella umbilicata f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate valerian, is a flowering plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shady garden settings."
