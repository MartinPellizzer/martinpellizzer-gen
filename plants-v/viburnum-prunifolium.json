    "intro": "Viburnum prunifolium, commonly known as common arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and grayish underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, drupes that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
