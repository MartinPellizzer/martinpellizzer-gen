    "intro": "Vatica maingayi, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy, and durable wood, which is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Vatica maingayi typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in secondary forest regrowth areas."
