    "intro": "Vaccinium laurifolium var. trichodes, commonly known as the coastal heath or silverleaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and moist woodlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
