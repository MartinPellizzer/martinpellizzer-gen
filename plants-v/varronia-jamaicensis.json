    "intro": "Varronia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican varronia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and parts of the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with rough, often thorned bark. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Varronia jamaicensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
