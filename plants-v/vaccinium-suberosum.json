    "intro": "Vaccinium suberosum, commonly known as the red evergreen huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often used in jams and wines. Vaccinium suberosum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
