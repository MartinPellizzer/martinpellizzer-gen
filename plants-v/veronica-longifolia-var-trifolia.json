    "intro": "Veronica longifolia var. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers clustered in dense spikes. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes for its delicate appearance."
