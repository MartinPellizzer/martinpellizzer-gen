It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
