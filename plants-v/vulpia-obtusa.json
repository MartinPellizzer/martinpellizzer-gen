    "intro": "Vulpia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, and its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. Vulpia obtusa produces small, pale green to brown flowers, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
