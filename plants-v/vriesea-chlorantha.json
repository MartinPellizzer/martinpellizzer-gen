It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Vriesea chlorantha is a compact plant, often growing to a height of about 12 to 18 inches. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
