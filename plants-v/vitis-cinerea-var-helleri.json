    "intro": "Vitis cinerea var. helleri, commonly known as Heller's grapevine, is a variant of the silverleaf grapevine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing growth habit and the presence of silver-white pubescence on its leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a distinct, hairy underside. Its small, clustered flowers give way to berries that are usually green to yellowish in color. This plant is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
