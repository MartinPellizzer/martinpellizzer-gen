It features compound leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Viburnum strigosum is valued for its ornamental value and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
