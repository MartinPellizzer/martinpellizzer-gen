    "intro": "Vicia canescens subsp. serinica, commonly known as the silky vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
