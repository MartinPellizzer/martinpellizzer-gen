    "intro": "Vismia baccifera subsp. dealbata, commonly known as the white-leaved vismia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale green leaves that are often tinged with white or silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
