It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Vicia woroschilovii is often found in steppes and semi-desert regions, where it thrives in low-nutrient conditions."
