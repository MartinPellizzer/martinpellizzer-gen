    "intro": "Viburnum sambucinum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and smooth on both surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clustered inflorescences in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. The subspecies is distinguished by its smoother fruit surface compared to other varieties of elderberry."
