    "intro": "Viola sfikasiana, commonly known as the Sfikasian violet, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often marked with distinctive patterns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
