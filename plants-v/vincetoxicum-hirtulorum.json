    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hirtulorum, commonly known as the hairy false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in moist, well-drained environments. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
