    "intro": "Valeriana crinii subsp. epirotica, commonly known as the Epirotic valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are aromatic and contain compounds similar to those found in other valerian species, which may have medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
