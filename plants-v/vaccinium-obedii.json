    "intro": "Vaccinium obedii, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like heathers and cranberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to those of the common blueberry. Vaccinium obedii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental landscaping and small-scale cultivation."
