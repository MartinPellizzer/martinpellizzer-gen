    "intro": "Viburnum caudatum, commonly known as the red-leaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and striking foliage that turns vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and can be glossy or matte depending on the variety. Viburnum caudatum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
