    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 wirtgenii, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a flowering plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum thapsus, two species native to Europe and Asia. The plant is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that resemble those of the common mullein. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil conditions."
