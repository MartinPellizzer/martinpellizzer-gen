    "intro": "Veronica capensis, commonly known as the coastal germander, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Veronica capensis is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
