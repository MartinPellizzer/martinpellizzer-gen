    "intro": "Vitis succisa, commonly known as the red currant vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems that climb by means of tendrils. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, often used in jams and wines. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are greenish-white and appear in clusters. Vitis succisa is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
