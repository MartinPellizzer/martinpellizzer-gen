    "intro": "Vitis discolor, commonly known as sand grape, is a deciduous vine native to the United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, edible berries that range in color from green to purple. Vitis discolor is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its berries and wood."
