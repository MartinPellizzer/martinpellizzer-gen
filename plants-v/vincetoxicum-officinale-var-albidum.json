    "intro": "Vincetoxicum officinale var. albidum, commonly known as white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in woodland edges and meadows. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its fruit is a legume that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant contains alkaloids and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
