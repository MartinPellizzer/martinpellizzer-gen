    "intro": "Vitis pendula, commonly known as the weeping grape, is a deciduous vine native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its long, cascading tendrils that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, seed-filled berries in the fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Vitis pendula is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and seasonal color changes."
