    "intro": "Viscum album var. laxum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and apple trees. It has a dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals but serve as a food source for birds. Its growth is slow, and it can live for many years, often forming dense clusters on its host. Viscum album var. laxum plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity, particularly in forest ecosystems."
