    "intro": "Victoria amazonica, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon River basin. It is characterized by its enormous, circular leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The leaves are supported by a network of hollow, segmented petioles that help them float on the water's surface. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically appear in the early morning, opening in a bright yellow hue before closing in the afternoon. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
