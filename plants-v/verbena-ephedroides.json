It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Verbena ephedroides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
