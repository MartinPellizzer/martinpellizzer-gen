    "intro": "Vaccinium minusculum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other species in the Vaccinium genus. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture and remain evergreen throughout the year. Vaccinium minusculum is often used in native plant landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
