    "intro": "Viola accrescens, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple and violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The flowers bloom from spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
