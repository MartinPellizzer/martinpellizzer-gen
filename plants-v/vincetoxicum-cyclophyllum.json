    "intro": "Vincetoxicum cyclophyllum, commonly known as the cyclophyll violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Vincetoxicum cyclophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal but should be handled with care, as it contains toxic compounds."
