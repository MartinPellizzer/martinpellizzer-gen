    "intro": "Vaccaria hispanica var. liniflora, commonly known as Spanish sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
