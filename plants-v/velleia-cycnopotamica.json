    "intro": "Velleia cycnopotamica, commonly known as the water velleia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Velleia cycnopotamica is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with roots that help stabilize the soil in wet areas."
