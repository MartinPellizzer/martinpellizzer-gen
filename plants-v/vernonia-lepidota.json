    "intro": "Vernonia lepidota, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vernonia lepidota is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
