    "intro": "Vincetoxicum tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its roots are somewhat similar to those of the common bindweed, leading to potential confusion in identification. Vincetoxicum tauricum is known for its ornamental value but can be invasive in certain regions."
