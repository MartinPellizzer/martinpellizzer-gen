    "intro": "Vulpia granulata, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like flowers. Vulpia granulata is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to grazing. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
