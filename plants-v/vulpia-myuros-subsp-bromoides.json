    "intro": "Vulpia myuros subsp. bromoides, commonly known as the slender veld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems in its native range."
