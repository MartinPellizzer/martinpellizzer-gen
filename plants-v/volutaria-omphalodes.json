    "intro": "Volutaria omphalodes, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a yellow center. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Volutaria omphalodes is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical significance is heightened by its cultural and religious symbolism in various Asian traditions."
