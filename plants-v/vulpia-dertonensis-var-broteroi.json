    "intro": "Vulpia dertonensis var. broteroi, commonly known as the Dertonese foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to parts of southern Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is characterized by its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
