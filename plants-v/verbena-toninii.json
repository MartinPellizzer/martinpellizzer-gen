    "intro": "Verbena toninii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre verbena, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing vibrant purple or blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Verbena toninii is considered a rare and endangered species."
