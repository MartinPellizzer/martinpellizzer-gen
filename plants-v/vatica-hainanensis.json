It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Vatica hainanensis is valued for its ecological importance and is also used in traditional medicine."
