    "intro": "Vaccinium hirtum var. koreanum, commonly known as the Korean hairy blueberry, is a variant of the hairy blueberry species native to East Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white in color. Its berries are edible, though they are generally smaller and less sweet compared to other Vaccinium species. This variety thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across Korea and parts of China."
