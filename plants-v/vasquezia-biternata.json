    "intro": "Vasquezia biternata, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a soft, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with small, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Vasquezia biternata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful, wind-swaying form."
