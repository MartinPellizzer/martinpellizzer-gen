    "intro": "Vernonia aristata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. It has lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in fine, silky hairs. Vernonia aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
