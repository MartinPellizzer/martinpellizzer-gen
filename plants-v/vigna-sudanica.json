    "intro": "Vigna sudanica, commonly known as the African cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Vigna sudanica is well adapted to dry and semi-arid climates, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited water resources. Its seeds are rich in protein and are widely used in traditional cuisines across sub-Saharan Africa."
