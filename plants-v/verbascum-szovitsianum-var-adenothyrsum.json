    "intro": "Verbascum szovitsianum var. adenothyrsum, commonly known as the Hungarian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green to reddish bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
