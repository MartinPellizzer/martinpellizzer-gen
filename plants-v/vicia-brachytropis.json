    "intro": "Vicia brachytropis, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Vicia brachytropis is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
