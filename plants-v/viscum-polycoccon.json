    "intro": "Viscum polycoccon, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its sticky seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees. Viscum polycoccon plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting various wildlife species."
