    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 uechtritzii, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a hybrid between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattellum, resulting in a plant with distinctive gray-green foliage and tall spikes of yellow flowers. The leaves are large, fuzzy, and covered in soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
