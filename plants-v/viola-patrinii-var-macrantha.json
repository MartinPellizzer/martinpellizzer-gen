It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces showy violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ornamental value in native gardens."
