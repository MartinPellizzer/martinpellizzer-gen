It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management due to its vigorous growth."
