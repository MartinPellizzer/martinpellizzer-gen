It produces small, green, leafy stems and spherical, gelatinous berries that contain viscin, a sticky substance used for attachment. The plant is native to regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is often found in forested areas and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its unique growth habits and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists alike."
