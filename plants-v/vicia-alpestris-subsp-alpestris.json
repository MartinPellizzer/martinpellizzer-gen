    "intro": "Vicia alpestris subsp. alpestris, commonly known as alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, stipitate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by slender, cylindrical pods. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Vicia alpestris subsp. alpestris is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
