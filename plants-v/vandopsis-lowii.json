    "intro": "Vandopsis lowii, commonly known as the low's vandopsis, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
