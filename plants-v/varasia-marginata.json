    "intro": "Varasia marginata, commonly known as the marginated varasia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
