It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners in colder climates."
