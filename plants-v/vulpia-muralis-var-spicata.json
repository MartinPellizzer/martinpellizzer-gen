    "intro": "Vulpia muralis var. spicata, commonly known as the spicate wall grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in disturbed soils, such as those found along roadsides, waste areas, and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Vulpia muralis var. spicata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
