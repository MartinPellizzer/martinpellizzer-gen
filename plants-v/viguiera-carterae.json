    "intro": "Viguiera carterae, commonly known as Carter's coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a prominent central disk. Viguiera carterae thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
