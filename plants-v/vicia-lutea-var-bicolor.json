    "intro": "Vicia lutea var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow-and-white flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
