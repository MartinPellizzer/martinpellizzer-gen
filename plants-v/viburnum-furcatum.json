It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum furcatum thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and wildlife appeal."
