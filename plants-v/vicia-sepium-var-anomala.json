    "intro": "Vicia sepium var. anomala, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its prostrate growth habit. It is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family, known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, waste areas, and in hedgerows. Due to its nitrogen-fixing capability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
