It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in the summer, which are followed by distinctive, spiny, woody fruits. Vitex rufa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms and attractive foliage. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates."
