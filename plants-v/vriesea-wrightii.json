    "intro": "Vriesea wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's Vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette pattern, which helps collect rainwater for its root system. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often with a yellow or green center. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea wrightii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
