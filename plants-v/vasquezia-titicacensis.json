    "intro": "Vasquezia titicacensis, commonly known as the Titi Lake vasquezia, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in southern Peru. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring season, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vasquezia titicacensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
