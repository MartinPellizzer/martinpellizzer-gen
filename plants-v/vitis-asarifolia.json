It is characterized by its compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by clusters of small, dark berries. Vitis asarifolia is typically found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to thrive in partial shade. It is a relatively rare and lesser-known member of the Vitaceae family."
