    "intro": "Viscum cuneifolium var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, lanceolate leaves and white, sticky berries. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with a variety of host trees, including oaks and pines. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host. Viscum cuneifolium var. lanceolatum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
