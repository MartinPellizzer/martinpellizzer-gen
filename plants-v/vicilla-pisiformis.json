    "intro": "Vicilla pisiformis, commonly known as the kidney vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant has slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Vicilla pisiformis thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
