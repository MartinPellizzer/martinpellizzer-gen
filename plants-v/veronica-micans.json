It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that reflect light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.

It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable habitats."
