    "intro": "Vincetoxicum urceolatum, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like structures that split open to release the seeds. Vincetoxicum urceolatum is noted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
