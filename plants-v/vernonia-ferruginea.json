It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, violet-blue flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems.
