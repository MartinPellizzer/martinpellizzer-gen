    "intro": "Vatica granulata, commonly known as the granulated ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it is valued in both traditional medicine and reforestation efforts."
