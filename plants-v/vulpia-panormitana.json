It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
