    "intro": "Vernonia luxuriosa, commonly known as the showy ironweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and dense clusters of bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and native plant landscapes. Vernonia luxuriosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
