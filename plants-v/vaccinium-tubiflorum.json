    "intro": "Vaccinium tubiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coniferous forest understories. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which develop into edible berries that are popular among wildlife and humans. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain soil moisture. Vaccinium tubiflorum plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining forest ecosystems."
