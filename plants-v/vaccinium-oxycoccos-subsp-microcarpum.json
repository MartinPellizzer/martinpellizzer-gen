    "intro": "Vaccinium oxycoccos subsp. microcarpum, commonly known as the lesser cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on acidic, wet soils, often found in bogs, fens, and other moist habitats. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but less commonly consumed compared to other cranberry species. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and remain green throughout the year. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact fruits and shorter pedicels compared to the typical *V. oxycoccos*."
