    "intro": "Vaccinium saxatile, commonly known as the alpine blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, dark blue berries. Its leaves are oval and leathery, providing dense foliage that helps insulate the plant from harsh weather. Vaccinium saxatile is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
