    "intro": "Viburnum tridentatum, commonly known as the three-toothed viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, three-lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Viburnum tridentatum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It is also a host plant for several species of butterflies and moths."
