    "intro": "Valenzuelia dissecta, commonly known as the dissected valenzuelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with deep lobes. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Valenzuelia dissecta is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
