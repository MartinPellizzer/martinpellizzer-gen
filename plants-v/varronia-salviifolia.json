    "intro": "Varronia salviifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a history of use in traditional medicine. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
