    "intro": "Vitis flexuosa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a distinctively veined structure, often with a pale underside. Its small, clustered flowers are greenish-white and appear in the spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple. This plant is adapted to moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, humid habitats."
