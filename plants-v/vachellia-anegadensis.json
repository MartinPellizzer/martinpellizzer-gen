    "intro": "Vachellia anegadensis, commonly known as the Anegada acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly found on the island of Anegada in the British Virgin Islands. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are trifoliate at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, woody pods contain several seeds, and the plant is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Vachellia anegadensis plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
