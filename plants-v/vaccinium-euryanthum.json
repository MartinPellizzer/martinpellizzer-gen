    "intro": "Vaccinium euryanthum, commonly known as the red evergreen huckleberry, is a species of shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in local culinary traditions. Vaccinium euryanthum thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers."
