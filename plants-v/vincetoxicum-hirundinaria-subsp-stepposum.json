    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hirundinaria subsp. stepposum, commonly known as the steppe milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
