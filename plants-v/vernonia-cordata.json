    "intro": "Vernonia cordata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple composite flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant typically grows in moist, open habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
