It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
