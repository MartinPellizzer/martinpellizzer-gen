    "intro": "Veitchia simulans, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high light exposure. Due to its unique appearance and historical significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
