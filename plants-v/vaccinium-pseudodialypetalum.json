It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries, which are typically red or black when mature, are edible and often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity."
