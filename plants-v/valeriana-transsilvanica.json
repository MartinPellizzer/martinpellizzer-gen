    "intro": "Valeriana transsilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe, particularly Romania and the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which contain two mericarps each. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Valeriana transsilvanica is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its calming effects."
