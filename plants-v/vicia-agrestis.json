    "intro": "Vicia agrestis, commonly known as the field vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, slender stems that often bear clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Vicia agrestis thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
