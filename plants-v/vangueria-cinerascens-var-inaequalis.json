    "intro": "Vangueria cinerascens var. inaequalis, commonly known as the variable vangueria, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, almost sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The varietal name 'inaequalis' refers to the variation in leaf size and shape within the species."
