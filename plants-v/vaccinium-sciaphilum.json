    "intro": "Vaccinium sciaphilum, commonly known as the shade-loving blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial to full shade, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five petals, and it bears edible, blue-black berries that are rich in antioxidants. Vaccinium sciaphilum is well adapted to acidic soils and plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
