    "intro": "Vittaria longicoma, commonly known as the long-stemmed chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of forests. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its survival by attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
