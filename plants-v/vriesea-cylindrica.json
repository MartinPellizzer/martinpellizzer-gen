    "intro": "Vriesea cylindrica, commonly known as the sword fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, sword-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, spadix-like flowers that are often red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea cylindrica is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
