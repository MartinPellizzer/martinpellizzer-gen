    "intro": "Vesicaria montana, commonly known as the mountain bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to alpine regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually submerged or partially submerged, with specialized structures for capturing insects. Vesicaria montana plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
