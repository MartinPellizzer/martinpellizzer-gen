    "intro": "Viguiera retroflexa, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Viguiera retroflexa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
