    "intro": "Volvulus sepium var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant has thin, branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its variety name. It thrives in slow-moving or still water, often in nutrient-poor environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and nutrient acquisition."
