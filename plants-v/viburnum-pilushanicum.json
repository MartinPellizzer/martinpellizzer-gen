    "intro": "Viburnum pilushanicum, commonly known as the Siberian viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, featuring dense, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries in the fall. Viburnum pilushanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its seasonal interest and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
