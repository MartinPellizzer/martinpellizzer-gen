    "intro": "Vandellia caespitosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spiky appearance and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in harsh maritime environments. Vandellia caespitosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
