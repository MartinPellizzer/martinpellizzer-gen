It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
