    "intro": "Vitis crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved grapevine, is a perennial vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits. Vitis crassifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
