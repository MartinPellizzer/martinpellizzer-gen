It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments."
