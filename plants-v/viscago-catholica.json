    "intro": "Viscago catholica, commonly known as the sacred vine, is a climbing plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by red berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. Due to its cultural significance in some indigenous communities, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or spiritual purposes."
