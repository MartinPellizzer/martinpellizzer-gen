    "intro": "Vaccinium salignum, commonly known as coastal blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, acidic soils and is often found in dunes and tidal marshes. The plant produces small, blue berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Vaccinium salignum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
