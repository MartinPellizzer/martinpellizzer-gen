    "intro": "Vitis vinifera silvestris, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a species native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is a climbing vine that produces small, clustered berries, which are typically green when unripe and turn dark purple or black when mature. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and is characterized by its woody stems and tendrils that help it climb. It is often found in woodland areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This species is closely related to the domesticated grapevines used in winemaking and has historical significance in traditional herbal medicine."
