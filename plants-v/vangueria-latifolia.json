    "intro": "Vangueria latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved vangueria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and alternate, broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive, slightly waxy texture. Vangueria latifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in regions with limited rainfall."
