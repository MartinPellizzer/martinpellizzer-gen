It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment."
