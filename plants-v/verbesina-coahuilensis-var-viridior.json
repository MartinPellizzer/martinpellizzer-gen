    "intro": "Verbesina coahuilensis var. viridior, commonly known as the greenleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
