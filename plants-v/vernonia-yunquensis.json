    "intro": "Vernonia yunquensis, commonly known as Yunqu vernonia, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its foliage is often lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Vernonia yunquensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
