    "intro": "Vulpia reclinata, commonly known as the bentgrass or false bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Vulpia reclinata is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions. It plays a minor role in ecological systems but is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
