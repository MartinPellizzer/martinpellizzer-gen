    "intro": "Vaccinium versicolor var. minus, commonly known as the small bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers full to partial sunlight. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and the flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in the spring. This variety is notable for its smaller size compared to other Vaccinium species, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings."
