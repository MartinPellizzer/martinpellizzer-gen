It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the summer months. It is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
