    "intro": "Vitis sicyoides var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved grapevine, is a lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its robust vines and heart-shaped leaves with rounded lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to clusters of berries, which are typically blue-black when mature. Native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its ornamental and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
