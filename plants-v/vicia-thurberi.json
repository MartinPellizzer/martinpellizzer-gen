    "intro": "Vicia thurberi, commonly known as Thurber's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial legume that produces small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevents erosion. Vicia thurberi plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native range."
