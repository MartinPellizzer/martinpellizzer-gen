    "intro": "Vincetoxicum arnottianum, commonly known as the New Zealand devil's-bit, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features striking, bi-colored flowers with purple upper petals and yellow lower ones, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a trailing habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vincetoxicum arnottianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover."
