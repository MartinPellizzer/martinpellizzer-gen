    "intro": "Vicia semicincta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Vicia semicincta is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands."
