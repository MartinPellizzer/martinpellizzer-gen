    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vetenata dubia, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
