    "intro": "Vernonia bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom from late summer into early fall. Vernonia bracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
