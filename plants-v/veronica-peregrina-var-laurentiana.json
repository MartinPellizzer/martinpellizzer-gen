    "intro": "Veronica peregrina var. laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, blue to purple flowers clustered in pairs along the stems. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This variety thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive and resilient plant for rock gardens and naturalized landscapes."
