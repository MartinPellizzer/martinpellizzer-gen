    "intro": "Vochysia mapuerae, commonly known as the Mapuera velvetwood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often reddish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
