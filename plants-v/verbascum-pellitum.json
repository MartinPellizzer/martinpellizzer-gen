    "intro": "Verbascum pellitum, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its fibrous roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Verbascum pellitum is also valued for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating respiratory ailments."
