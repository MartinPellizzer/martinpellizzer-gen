    "intro": "Verbascum bellum, commonly known as the silverleaf mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, silver-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Verbascum bellum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
