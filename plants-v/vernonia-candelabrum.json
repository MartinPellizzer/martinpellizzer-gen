    "intro": "Vernonia candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branching stem that resembles a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia candelabrum is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
