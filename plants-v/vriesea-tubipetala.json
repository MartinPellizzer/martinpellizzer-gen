    "intro": "Vriesea tubipetala, commonly known as the \"Bottlebrush Vriesea,\" is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, tubular inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, which gives it its common name. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette, creating a central reservoir for collecting rainwater. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a red throat, and bloom in late summer or early autumn. Vriesea tubipetala is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of indirect light and moderate humidity."
