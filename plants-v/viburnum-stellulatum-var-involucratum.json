It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
