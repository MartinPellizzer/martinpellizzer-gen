    "intro": "Viscum piperoides, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oak and apple. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like stems, which are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a distinctive white midrib. Viscum piperoides plays a significant role in forest ecosystems and is also associated with cultural traditions during the holiday season."
