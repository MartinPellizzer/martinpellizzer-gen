    "intro": "Vincetoxicum wootonii, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and striking fruit clusters. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
