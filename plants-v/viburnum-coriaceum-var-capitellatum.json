    "intro": "Viburnum coriaceum var. capitellatum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like drupes in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The shrub is also valued for its ability to attract wildlife, including birds and pollinators."
