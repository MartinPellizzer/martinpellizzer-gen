    "intro": "Viguiera reticulata, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots make it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Viguiera reticulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
