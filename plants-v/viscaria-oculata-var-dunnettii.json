    "intro": "Viscaria oculata var. dunnettii, commonly known as the Dunnett's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the British Isles. It features small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in early summer, adding a bright touch to rocky or gravelly habitats. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand coastal conditions, making it suitable for maritime gardens."
