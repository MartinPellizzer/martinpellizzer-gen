    "intro": "Vincetoxicum maeoticum, commonly known as the Crimean teasel, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruits are dry, schizocarpic nuts that split into two parts when mature. Vincetoxicum maeoticum is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and forest edges."
