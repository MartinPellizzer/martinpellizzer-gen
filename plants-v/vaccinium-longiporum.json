    "intro": "Vaccinium longiporum, commonly known as the long-stemmed blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as heathers and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to other blueberries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens and conservation areas."
