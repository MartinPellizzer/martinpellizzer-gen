    "intro": "Viola abulensis f. clandestina, commonly known as the secret viola, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil. Its unique name reflects its mysterious and hard-to-find nature in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
