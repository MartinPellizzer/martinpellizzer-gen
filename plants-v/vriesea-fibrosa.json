    "intro": "Vriesea fibrosa, commonly known as the Fibrous Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea fibrosa is popular as a ornamental plant due to its dramatic floral display and relatively low maintenance requirements."
