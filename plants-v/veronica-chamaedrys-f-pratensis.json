    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys f. pratensis, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has succulent, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a silvery appearance. This variety is often found in grassy areas, along paths, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
