    "intro": "Veronica sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 15-30 centimeters. The plant features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
