    "intro": "Vismia mandurr, commonly known as the silky waterleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal rainforests. Vismia mandurr is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
