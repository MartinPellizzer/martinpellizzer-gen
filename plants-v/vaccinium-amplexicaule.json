    "intro": "Vaccinium amplexicaule, commonly known as the clustered blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats, with small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue or black berries. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in culinary applications. Vaccinium amplexicaule thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
