    "intro": "Vulpia myuros subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, perennial plant with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is typically borne at the tip of the stem. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, three-lobed spikelets that are distinctive in structure. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
