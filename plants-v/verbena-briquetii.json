    "intro": "Verbena briquetii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers, which range in color from blue to purple, bloom in late spring to early summer. Verbena briquetii is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
