It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright blue berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and heathlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its use in both culinary and commercial blueberry cultivation."
