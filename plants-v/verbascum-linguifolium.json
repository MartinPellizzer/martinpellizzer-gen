    "intro": "Verbascum linguifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are large, broad, and often heart-shaped, with a velvety texture that distinguishes it from other mullein species. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions."
