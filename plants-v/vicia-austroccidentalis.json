    "intro": "Vicia austroccidentalis, commonly known as the western vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Vicia austroccidentalis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
