    "intro": "Valeriana dioica subsp. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, pinnatifid (lobed) leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Its root system is fibrous and contains volatile oils, which contribute to its aromatic properties. This subspecies is valued in traditional medicine for its calming effects."
