    "intro": "Viola nana, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Viola nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable habitats."
