    "intro": "Vriesea simplex, commonly known as the velvetleaf bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that can range from orange to red. Its leaves are adapted to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Vriesea simplex is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
