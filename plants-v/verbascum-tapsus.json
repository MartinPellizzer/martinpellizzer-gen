    "intro": "Verbascum tapsus, commonly known as the woolly lamb's ear, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage that feels velvety to the touch. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
