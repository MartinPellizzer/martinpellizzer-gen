    "intro": "Vernonia pulverulenta, commonly known as the downy ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
