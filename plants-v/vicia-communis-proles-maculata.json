    "intro": "Vicia communis proles maculata, commonly known as the spotted vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The leaves are typically green with a distinctive purple or reddish mottling, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in fields. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
