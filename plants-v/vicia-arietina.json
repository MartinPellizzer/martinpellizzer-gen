    "intro": "Vicia arietina, commonly known as the \"shepherd's pea,\" is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Vicia arietina is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators also contribute to its significance in botanical studies."
