    "intro": "Veratrum album var. viride, commonly known as green hellebore, is a variant of the white hellebore native to the northern regions of Europe. It is a tall, herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 2 meters in height, featuring large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is adapted to moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, well-drained soils. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals."
