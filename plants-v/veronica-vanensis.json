    "intro": "Veronica vanensis, commonly known as the Vanuatu speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Veronica vanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
