    "intro": "Viola salina, commonly known as the salt violet, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to saline environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate moderate levels of salt spray. Its growth habit is typically low and mat-forming, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Viola salina plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small insects."
