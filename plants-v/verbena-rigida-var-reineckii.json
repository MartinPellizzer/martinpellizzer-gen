It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces showy spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom from summer to fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
