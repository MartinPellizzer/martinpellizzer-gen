    "intro": "Vernonia tayloriae, commonly known as Taylor's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant is known for its tall, slender stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its bright yellow to orange flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia tayloriae is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
