    "intro": "Veconcibea pleiostemona, commonly known as the West African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been traditionally used in local crafts and for its medicinal value."
