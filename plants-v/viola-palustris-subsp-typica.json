    "intro": "Viola palustris subsp. typica, commonly known as the marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, often boggy soils and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and violet or purple flowers. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in association with other wetland species. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
