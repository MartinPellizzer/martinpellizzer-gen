It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in woodland areas and along forest edges. It has a creeping habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
