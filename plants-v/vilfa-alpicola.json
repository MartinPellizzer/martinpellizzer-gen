    "intro": "Vilfa alpicola, commonly known as the alpine vilfa, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, temperate climates. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vilfa alpicola is considered a vulnerable species."
