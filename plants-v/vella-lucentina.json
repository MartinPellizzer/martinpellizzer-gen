    "intro": "Vella lucentina, commonly known as the shimmering vella, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent leaves that reflect light like glass, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are known to exude a mildly toxic sap, which has been used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat destruction, Vella lucentina is now classified as an endangered species."
