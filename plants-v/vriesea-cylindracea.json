    "intro": "Vriesea cylindracea, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, dark green, and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom after the leaves have matured. Vriesea cylindracea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
