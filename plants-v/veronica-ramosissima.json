    "intro": "Veronica ramosissima, commonly known as sand veronica, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as plains and slopes. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, while its stems are branched and often covered in fine pubescence. Sand veronica is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
