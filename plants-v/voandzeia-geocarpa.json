It is characterized by its climbing habit and pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its nutritional value, it is an important crop in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa."
