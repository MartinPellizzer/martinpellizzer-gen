    "intro": "Vaccinium myrsinites var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are typically broader and more rounded compared to the typical variety. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. These flowers give way to edible berries that are dark blue to black in color, often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
