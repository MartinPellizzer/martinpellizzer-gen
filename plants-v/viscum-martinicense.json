    "intro": "Viscum martinicense, commonly known as the Martinique mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the Caribbean region. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green in color. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
