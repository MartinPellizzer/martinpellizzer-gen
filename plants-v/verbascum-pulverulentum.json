    "intro": "Verbascum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, fuzzy, and often used in traditional herbal medicine. Verbascum pulverulentum is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments."
