    "intro": "Vitis debilis, commonly known as the weak grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis debilis is often found in moist, wooded areas and can be a host plant for certain insect species. It is not typically cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
