    "intro": "Vittaria himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan spikemoss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its small, erect stems and dense clusters of leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spores in capsules that are borne on short, stalked shoots called sporophytes. Vittaria himalayensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats in mountainous regions."
