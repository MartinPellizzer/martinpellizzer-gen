    "intro": "Varronia bullata subsp. humilis, commonly known as the slender varronia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne at the leaf axils. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that dehisce to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to grow in humid, low-light conditions."
