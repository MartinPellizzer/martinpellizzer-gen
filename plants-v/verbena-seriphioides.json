    "intro": "Verbena seriphioides, commonly known as narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Verbena seriphioides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
