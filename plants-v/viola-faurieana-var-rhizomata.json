It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive yellow or white keel. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a hardy and resilient species."
