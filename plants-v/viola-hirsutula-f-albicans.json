    "intro": "Viola hirsutula f. albicans, commonly known as the white hirsute violet, is a naturally occurring variant of the hirsute violet. It is characterized by its pale to almost white petals, which distinguish it from the typical purple or violet hues of the species. The plant is a low-growing perennial herb with heart-shaped leaves and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch of color to its habitat."
