    "intro": "Vleckia incarnata, commonly known as the pink trumpet vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and vibrant pink to purple tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
