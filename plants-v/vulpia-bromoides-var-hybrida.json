    "intro": "Vulpia bromoides var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
