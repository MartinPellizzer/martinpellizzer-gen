    "intro": "Vigolina armella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Vigolina armella is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
