    "intro": "Virola peruviana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and hairy bark, which gives it its varietal name \"tomentosa.\" The tree produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiky fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a leathery texture. The wood of this species is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies."
