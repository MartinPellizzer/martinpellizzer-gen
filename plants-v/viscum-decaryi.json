It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. It forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while providing shelter for certain insects and birds. Due to its ecological role and medicinal potential, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
