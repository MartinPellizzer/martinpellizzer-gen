    "intro": "Veronica restrictior, commonly known as the narrowleaf speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Veronica restrictior is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
