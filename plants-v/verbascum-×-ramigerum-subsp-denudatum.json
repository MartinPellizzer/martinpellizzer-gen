    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 ramigerum subsp. denudatum, commonly known as the naked mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, velvety leaves that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its common name, \"naked mullein,\" refers to the reduced leaf coverage compared to other species in the genus."
