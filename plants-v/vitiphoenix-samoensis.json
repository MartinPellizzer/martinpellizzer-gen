    "intro": "Vitiphoenix samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan fan palm, is a flowering plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red fruits containing a single seed. Vitiphoenix samoensis is adapted to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
