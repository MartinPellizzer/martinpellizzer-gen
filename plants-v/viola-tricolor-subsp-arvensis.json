It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple, white, and yellow coloration on its flowers, which bloom from spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens.
