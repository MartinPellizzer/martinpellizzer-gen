    "intro": "Verbascum saccatum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woolly, gray-green leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it is often found in coastal or inland dry habitats. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
