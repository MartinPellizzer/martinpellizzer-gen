It features a robust root system and upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a strong, often spicy scent. Valeriana radicalis is known for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects due to the presence of volatile oils."
