    "intro": "Vitis simplex, commonly known as the simple grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis simplex is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and restoration projects."
