It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The smooth, glabrous stems and leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance and ecological role in its native range."
