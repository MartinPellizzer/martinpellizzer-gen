    "intro": "Viburnum acerifolium var. densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower mapleleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that resemble maple leaves, with a serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, floral display, and seasonal fruit, making it a popular choice for landscape use."
