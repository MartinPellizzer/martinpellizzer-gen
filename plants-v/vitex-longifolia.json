    "intro": "Vitex longifolia, commonly known as the Indian Vitex or longflower vitex, is a shrub or small tree native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet to blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that contains several small, dark seeds. Vitex longifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
