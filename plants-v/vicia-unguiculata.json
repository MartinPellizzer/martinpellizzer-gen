    "intro": "Vicia unguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a herbaceous legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Vicia unguiculata is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
