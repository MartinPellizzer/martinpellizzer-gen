    "intro": "Vicia tsydenii, commonly known as the Siberian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep violet, depending on the variety. Vicia tsydenii is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
