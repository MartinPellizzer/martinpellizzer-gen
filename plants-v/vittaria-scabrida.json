    "intro": "Vittaria scabrida, commonly known as the scaly maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly scaly texture on the underside. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Vittaria scabrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
