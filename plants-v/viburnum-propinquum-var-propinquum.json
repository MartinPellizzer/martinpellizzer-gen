It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Viburnum propinquum var. propinquum typically grows in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade."
