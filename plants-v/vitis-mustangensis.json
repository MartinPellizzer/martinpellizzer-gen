    "intro": "Vitis mustangensis, commonly known as Mustang grape, is a rare and wild vine native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its vigorous growth and deep root system. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible berries, though they are typically not cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
