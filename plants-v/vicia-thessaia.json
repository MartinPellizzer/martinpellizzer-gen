    "intro": "Vicia thessaia, commonly known as the Southern vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pods containing several elliptical seeds, which are typically brown or black in color. Vicia thessaia is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
