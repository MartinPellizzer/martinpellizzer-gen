    "intro": "Viola hebecarpa, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Viola. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety hair. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a distinctive yellow center. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Viola hebecarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
