It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their large, showy flowers. The plant features fuzzy, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Verbascum shahsavarensis is adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
