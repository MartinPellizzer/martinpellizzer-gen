    "intro": "Vaccinium exul, commonly known as the slender blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. Its flowers are bell-shaped, pinkish-white, and appear in clusters, while the berries are small, blue-black, and edible. Vaccinium exul is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
