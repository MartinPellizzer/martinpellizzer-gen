    "intro": "Vitis boulderensis, commonly known as Boulder grape, is a species of flowering vine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
