The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, fleshy berries. Its stems are woody and can twine around supports, while its roots are fibrous and adaptive to moist, well-drained soils. This species is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and along stream banks."
