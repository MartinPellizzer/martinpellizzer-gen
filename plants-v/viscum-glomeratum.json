    "intro": "Viscum glomeratum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are evergreen and arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum glomeratum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its presence can have both ecological and cultural significance, particularly in traditional holiday customs."
