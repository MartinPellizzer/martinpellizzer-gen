    "intro": "Veronica syriaca subsp. debilis, commonly known as slender speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically features slender, upright stems covered in small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
