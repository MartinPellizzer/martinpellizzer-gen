It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is valued for its valuable seed kernel, which is used to produce shea butter. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are harvested for their nutritious kernel."
