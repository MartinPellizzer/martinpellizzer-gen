    "intro": "Vesicaria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called vesicles that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that are adapted for aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water and is often found in temperate regions. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
