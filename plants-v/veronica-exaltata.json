    "intro": "Veronica exaltata, commonly known as sky pilot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Veronica exaltata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, airy inflorescences."
