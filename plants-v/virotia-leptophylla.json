    "intro": "Virotia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf virotia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. It is a small, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbels, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Virotia leptophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with partial shade."
