    "intro": "Vincetoxicum albidum, commonly known as white bittersweet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though caution is advised due to its poisonous properties."
