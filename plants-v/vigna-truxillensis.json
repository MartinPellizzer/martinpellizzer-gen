    "intro": "Vigna truxillensis, commonly known as the Truxillensis bean, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Colombia and Ecuador. It is a climbing legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Vigna truxillensis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils with ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
