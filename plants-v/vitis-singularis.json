    "intro": "Vitis singularis, commonly known as the singular grapevine, is a lesser-known species within the Vitis genus. It is native to parts of Asia and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that give way to berries, though these are not typically cultivated for wine or table use. Vitis singularis is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Due to its rarity and limited study, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
