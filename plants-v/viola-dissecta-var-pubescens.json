    "intro": "Viola dissecta var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy heartleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a distinctive downward-curving spur that houses nectar, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture and resist herbivory, making it well adapted to woodland and shaded environments."
