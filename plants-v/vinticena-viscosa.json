    "intro": "Vinticena viscosa, commonly known as the sticky vinticena, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that exude a viscous, sticky substance, which is a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its unique properties, it has been studied for potential medicinal and industrial applications."
