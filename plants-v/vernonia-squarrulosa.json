It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia squarrulosa is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
