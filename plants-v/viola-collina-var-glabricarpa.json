It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, usually in shades of purple or blue, that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its smooth, glabrous stems distinguish it from other varieties within the Viola genus."
