    "intro": "Viscum myriophlebium var. flabellifolium, commonly known as the flabellifoliate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree via a specialized root system called a haustellum. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives on oaks and other hardwoods. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Its flowers are greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. The species is notable for its ecological role in providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
