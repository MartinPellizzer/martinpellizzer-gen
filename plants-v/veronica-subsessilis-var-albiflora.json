    "intro": "Veronica subsessilis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
