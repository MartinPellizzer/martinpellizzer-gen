    "intro": "Vulpia membranacea subsp. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
