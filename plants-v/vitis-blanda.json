    "intro": "Vitis blanda, commonly known as creeping grape or wild grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue during the growing season. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that turn from green to red or black as they mature. Vitis blanda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it a common ornamental and ecological plant in the region."
