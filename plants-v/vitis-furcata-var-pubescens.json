    "intro": "Vitis furcata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent grapevine, is a variant of the grapevine species native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other grapevine varieties. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically dark in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
