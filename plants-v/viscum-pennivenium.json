It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant forms dense clusters and has a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while also providing shelter for various wildlife species. Viscum pennivenium is widely distributed across Europe, parts of Asia, and North Africa. Its presence often indicates the health of the forest ecosystem it inhabits."
