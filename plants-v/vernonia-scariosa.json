    "intro": "Vernonia scariosa, commonly known as the rough vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures that give it a rough texture. The flowers are usually yellow or brown, and they bloom from late summer into early fall."
