    "intro": "Viburnum sempervirens, commonly known as evergreen viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features dark green, glossy leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter, giving it a striking appearance even in cold weather. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its compact growth habit and adaptability make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Viburnum sempervirens thrives in partial to full shade and is relatively low maintenance once established."
