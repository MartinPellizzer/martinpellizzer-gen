    "intro": "Vriesea regnellii, commonly known as the regnellii pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pineapple, which is a key botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are long, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a central cup that collects water. Vriesea regnellii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
