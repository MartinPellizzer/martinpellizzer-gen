    "intro": "Vatica granulata subsp. sabaensis, commonly known as the Sabaensis Vatica, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and is valued for its durable timber. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
