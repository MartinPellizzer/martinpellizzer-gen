    "intro": "Verbascum nigrum subsp. abietinum, commonly known as the black mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered in dense, fuzzy gray-green leaves. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage are adaptations to its arid habitat, aiding in water retention and protection from herbivores."
