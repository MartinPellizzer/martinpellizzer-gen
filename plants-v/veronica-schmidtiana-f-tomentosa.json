    "intro": "Veronica schmidtiana f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fuzzy, hairy leaves and stems, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
