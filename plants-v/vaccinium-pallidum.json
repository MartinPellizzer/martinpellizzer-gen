    "intro": "Vaccinium pallidum, commonly known as the white highbush blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool climate with ample sunlight. Its berries, which are usually pale blue or white, are not commonly consumed by humans but are important for wildlife. Vaccinium pallidum plays a significant role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various species."
