    "intro": "Viola montagnei var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its leaves are covered in small glands, which give it its scientific name and contribute to its unique appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
