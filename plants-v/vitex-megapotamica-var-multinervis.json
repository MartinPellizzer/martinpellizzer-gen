    "intro": "Vitex megapotamica var. multinervis, commonly known as the Brazilian vitex or red vitex, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with prominent veins, which give it the \"multinervis\" variety name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are small, woody drupes that contain a single seed. This species is often used in traditional medicine and has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
