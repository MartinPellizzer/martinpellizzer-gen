    "intro": "Vanda amiensis, commonly known as the Ami's vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Vanda amiensis thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Its flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
