    "intro": "Viola induta, commonly known as the velvetleaf violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a distinctive purple underside. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of violet or blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Viola induta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
