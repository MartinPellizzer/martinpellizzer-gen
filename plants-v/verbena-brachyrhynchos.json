    "intro": "Verbena brachyrhynchos, commonly known as the coastal verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbena brachyrhynchos is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and is often found along the edges of dunes and coastal prairies."
