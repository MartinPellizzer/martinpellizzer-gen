    "intro": "Vancouveria chrysantha var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered goldfoe, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
