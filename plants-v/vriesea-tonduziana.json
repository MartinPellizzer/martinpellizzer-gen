    "intro": "Vriesea tonduziana, commonly known as the Tonduziana Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its roots absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
