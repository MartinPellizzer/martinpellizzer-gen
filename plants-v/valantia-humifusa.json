    "intro": "Valantia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping valerian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Valantia humifusa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
