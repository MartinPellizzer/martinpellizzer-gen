    "intro": "Viburnum hypoleucum, commonly known as the white-fruited viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by white, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for wildlife, including birds and small mammals. Viburnum hypoleucum thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
