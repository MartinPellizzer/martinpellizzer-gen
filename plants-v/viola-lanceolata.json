    "intro": "Viola lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces violet-blue or purple flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive yellow or white marking at the base. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Viola lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
