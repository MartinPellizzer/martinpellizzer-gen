    "intro": "Viburnum detractum, commonly known as the Canadian arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces flat, clustered inflorescences of white flowers in early summer, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are edible for birds. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun in moist, well-drained soils. Viburnum detractum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
