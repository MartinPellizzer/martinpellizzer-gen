    "intro": "Verbascum nuriae, commonly known as the Kashmir mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum nuriae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
