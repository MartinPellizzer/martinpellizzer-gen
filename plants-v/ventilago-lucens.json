    "intro": "Ventilago lucens, commonly known as the shining velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
