    "intro": "Vantanea morii, commonly known as the mountain violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple and violet, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky soils, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Vantanea morii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
