    "intro": "Vaccinium album, commonly known as the white highbush blueberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible berries that are typically harvested in the summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and turn red in the fall. Vaccinium album is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
