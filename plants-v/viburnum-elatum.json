    "intro": "Viburnum elatum, commonly known as the mountain cranberry bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Viburnum elatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
