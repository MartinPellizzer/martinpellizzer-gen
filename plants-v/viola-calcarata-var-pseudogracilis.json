    "intro": "Viola calcarata var. pseudogracilis, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
