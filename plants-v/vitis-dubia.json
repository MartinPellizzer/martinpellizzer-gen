    "intro": "Vitis dubia, commonly known as the rare or obscure grapevine, is a lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of China and India. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and greenish-white in color. Vitis dubia produces small, inedible berries that are not commonly cultivated for human consumption."
