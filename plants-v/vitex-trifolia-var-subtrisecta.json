    "intro": "Vitex trifolia var. subtrisecta, commonly known as the three-parted chaste tree, is a variant of the chaste tree species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are further divided into three distinct leaflets, giving it the \"subtrisecta\" designation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, during the summer months. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a rounded form and woody stems that become more pronounced with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and landscapes."
