    "intro": "Vincetoxicum crenatum, commonly known as the creeping false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and pairs of opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vincetoxicum crenatum is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a plant of both ecological and horticultural interest."
