    "intro": "Vicia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, and it has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Vicia macrantha is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
