    "intro": "Vanda recurva, commonly known as the recurved vanda, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for hanging or mounted displays. Vanda recurva is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
