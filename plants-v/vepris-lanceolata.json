    "intro": "Vepris lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal forests and secondary growth areas. The wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
