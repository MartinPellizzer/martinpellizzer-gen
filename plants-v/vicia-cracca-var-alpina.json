    "intro": "Vicia cracca var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Vicia cracca var. alpina is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and its use in ecological restoration projects."
