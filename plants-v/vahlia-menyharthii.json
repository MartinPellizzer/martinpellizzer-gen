It typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters and has smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive aromatic scent. Vahlia menyharthii is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
