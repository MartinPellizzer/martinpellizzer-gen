    "intro": "Vandellia clausa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, thin roots and a single, waxy leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Vandellia clausa is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
