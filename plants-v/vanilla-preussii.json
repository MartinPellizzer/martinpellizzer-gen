    "intro": "Vanilla preussii, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, wiry stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive vanilla-like scent, which is a key feature in its common name. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. While not used for vanilla flavoring like its relative Vanilla planifolia, it is valued in horticulture for its beauty and unique aroma."
