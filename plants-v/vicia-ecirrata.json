    "intro": "Vicia ecirrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Vicia ecirrata is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is a nitrogen-fixing plant, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
