    "intro": "Viburnum omeiense, commonly known as the Sichuan viburnum, is a shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are edible but often considered astringent. Viburnum omeiense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
