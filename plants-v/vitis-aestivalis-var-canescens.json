It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of small, round berries. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with coarsely toothed margins. This variety is often found in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to partial to full sun."
