It is characterized by its robust, herbaceous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Valerianoides crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
