    "intro": "Vanilla weberbaueriana, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or the orchid vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's inflorescence develops into a long, slender pod that contains the aromatic seeds used in vanilla extraction. It thrives in warm, humid climates with partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its unique flavor profile, it is sometimes used as a substitute for traditional vanilla in culinary applications."
