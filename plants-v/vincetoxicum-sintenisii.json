    "intro": "Vincetoxicum sintenisii, commonly known as the African iron vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its fruits are follicles that contain seeds with a tuft of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Vincetoxicum sintenisii is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
