    "intro": "Vernonia firma, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small blue or purple clouds. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and streambanks. Its showy, daisy-like blooms appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Vernonia firma is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in waterlogged conditions."
