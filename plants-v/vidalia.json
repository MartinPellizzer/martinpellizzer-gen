    "intro": "Vidalia, commonly known as the Vidalia onion, is a variety of sweet onion native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale yellow skin and mild, sweet flavor due to its high sugar content and low sulfur content. The plant belongs to the Allium genus and is closely related to other onions like the common onion and leeks. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Vidalia onions are typically harvested in the spring and are a staple in Southern cuisine."
