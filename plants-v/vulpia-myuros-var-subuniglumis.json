    "intro": "Vulpia myuros var. subuniglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved veld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils, and is often found in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a potential forage plant for livestock."
