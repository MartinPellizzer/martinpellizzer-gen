    "intro": "Vicia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Vicia pauciflora is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various insects."
