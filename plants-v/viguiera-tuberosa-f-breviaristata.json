    "intro": "Viguiera tuberosa f. breviaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Mexican sunflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Mexico. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces bright yellow-orange composite flowers with prominent, showy ray florets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native gardens."
