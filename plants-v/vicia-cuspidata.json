    "intro": "Vicia cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep violet, typically blooming in early summer. Its pods are elongated and contain several elliptical seeds. Vicia cuspidata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
