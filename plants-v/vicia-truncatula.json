    "intro": "Vicia truncatula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and truncate at the ends. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Vicia truncatula is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often growing in grasslands and disturbed soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
