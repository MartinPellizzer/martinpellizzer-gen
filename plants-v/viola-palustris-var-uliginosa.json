    "intro": "Viola palustris var. uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with five petals, often with a yellow or white keel, during the spring months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and marshes. This variety is distinguished by its more robust growth compared to other viola species and its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
