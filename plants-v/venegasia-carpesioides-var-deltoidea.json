    "intro": "Venegasia carpesioides var. deltoidea, commonly known as the delta leaf venegasia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped leaves, which are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally grown in gardens and botanical collections."
