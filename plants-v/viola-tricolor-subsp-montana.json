    "intro": "Viola tricolor subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain pansy, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy flowers that typically display a combination of purple, yellow, and white petals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early spring blooms."
