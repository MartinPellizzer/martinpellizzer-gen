    "intro": "Vilfa nervosa, commonly known as the fine-veined willow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Salicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves with finely veined patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters. Vilfa nervosa plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
