    "intro": "Veronica comosa var. glaberrima, commonly known as the woolly speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, spreading stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
