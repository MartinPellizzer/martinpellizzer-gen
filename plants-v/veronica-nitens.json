It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas. Veronica nitens is a perennial herb that is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
