    "intro": "Vicia amurensis, commonly known as Amur vetch, is a perennial legume native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Vicia amurensis thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
