    "intro": "Vernonia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges, and it produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Vernonia parviflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
