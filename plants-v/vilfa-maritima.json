    "intro": "Vilfa maritima, commonly known as sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a distinctive anise-like scent when crushed. Vilfa maritima is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
