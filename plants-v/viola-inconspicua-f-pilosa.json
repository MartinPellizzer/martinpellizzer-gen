    "intro": "Viola inconspicua f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy violet, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with five petals and a spurred petal at the back. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The hairy foliage and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study and garden cultivation."
