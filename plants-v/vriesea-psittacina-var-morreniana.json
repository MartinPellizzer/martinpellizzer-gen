    "intro": "Vriesea psittacina var. morreniana, commonly known as the Morren's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central reservoir for collecting rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with brightly colored, long-lasting bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
