    "intro": "Viburnum mullaha var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf viburnum, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet, featuring dense, rounded foliage with ovate to elliptical leaves that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and berries, as well as its adaptability to various garden conditions."
