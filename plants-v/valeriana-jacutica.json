    "intro": "Valeriana jacutica, commonly known as Siberian valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a stout, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, bearing opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are the primary part used medicinally, containing compounds like valepotriates that contribute to its sedative properties. Valeriana jacutica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
