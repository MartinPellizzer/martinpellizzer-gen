It is a climbing vine characterized by its quadrangular (four-sided) stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to small, round berries that turn red when mature. These berries are edible and have a tart, musky flavor, often used in jams and wines. It is native to East Asia and thrives in temperate climates with ample sunlight."
