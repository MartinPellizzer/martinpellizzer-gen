    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. umbricola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep violet. This plant thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along forest edges. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
