    "intro": "Vaccinium viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically greenish-white, giving it its common name, and it produces edible berries that are similar in taste to highbush blueberries. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
