    "intro": "Vriesea vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea vidalii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
