    "intro": "Viola fimbriatula f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved viola, is a botanical variant of the violet species characterized by its glabrous (smooth) foliage. This plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and vibrant violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers are often adorned with distinctive markings that aid in pollination by attracting bees and other pollinators. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to native plant collections."
