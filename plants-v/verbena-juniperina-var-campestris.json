    "intro": "Verbena juniperina var. campestris, commonly known as the creeping verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via runners make it a hardy and versatile choice for xeriscaping."
