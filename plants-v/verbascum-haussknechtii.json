    "intro": "Verbascum haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's mullein, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its ecological importance lies in providing nectar sources and habitat for various insects in its native environment."
