    "intro": "Vitis solonis var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded fox grape, is a lesser-known variety of the grapevine family. It is characterized by its small, round berries that are typically dark purple in color. The plant is native to regions of eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in temperate climates. It has a trailing growth habit and produces clusters of fruit that are often used in traditional medicine. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other Vitis species, with its unique seed morphology and overall plant structure."
