    "intro": "Vella pseudocytisus subsp. orcensis, commonly known as the Orkney buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Orkney Islands in Scotland. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Scottish islands. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
