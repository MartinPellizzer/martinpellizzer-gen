    "intro": "Viburnum opulus subsp. americanum, commonly known as American elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist woodlands or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
