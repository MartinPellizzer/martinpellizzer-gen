    "intro": "Viscum austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and apple trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum austriacum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and has a distinctive appearance with its evergreen foliage. It plays a role in local ecosystems, providing food for certain bird species despite its toxic properties."
