    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often used in agriculture as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Additionally, it is valued in ecological restoration projects for its erosion control capabilities and habitat provision for pollinators."
