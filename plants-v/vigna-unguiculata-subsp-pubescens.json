    "intro": "Vigna unguiculata subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the cowpea or black-eyed pea, is a leguminous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces pods that contain one or two large, kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used as a food source. It is a warm-season crop that thrives in well-drained soils and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The subspecies pubescens is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which helps in reducing water loss and deterring pests."
