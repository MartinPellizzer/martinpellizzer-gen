    "intro": "Vaccinium foxworthyi, commonly known as the Foxworth's blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Oregon and California. It typically reaches a height of 1 to 2 feet and features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to edible berries that are usually blue or purple in color, though they are smaller and less commonly consumed than other blueberry species. Vaccinium foxworthyi thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or dune environments."
