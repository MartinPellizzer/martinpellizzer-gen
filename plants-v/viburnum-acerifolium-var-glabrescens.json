    "intro": "Viburnum acerifolium var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and ovate, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage color changes and attractive fruit display."
