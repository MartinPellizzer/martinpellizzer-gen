    "intro": "Verbascum pallidum, commonly known as the pale mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a tall, upright spike. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Verbascum pallidum is a perennial species that is well adapted to arid environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
