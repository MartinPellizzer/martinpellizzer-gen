    "intro": "Vernonia maritima, commonly known as sea ironweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Vernonia maritima is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
