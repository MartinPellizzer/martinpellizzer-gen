    "intro": "Viscum kaempferi, commonly known as the Japanese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own nutrients through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds. These berries contain seeds that are dispersed through bird droppings, allowing the plant to spread to new hosts. Viscum kaempferi is native to East Asia and is often found growing in forests and woodlands."
