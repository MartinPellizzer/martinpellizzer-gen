    "intro": "Vitis \u00d7 isabellae, commonly known as the Isabelline grape, is a hybrid vine species resulting from the cross between Vitis vinifera and Vitis riparia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and the production of small, sweet, and aromatic berries. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruits. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The Isabelline grape is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to withstand colder climates."
