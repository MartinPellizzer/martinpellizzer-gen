    "intro": "Vrydagzynea formosana, commonly known as the Formosan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
