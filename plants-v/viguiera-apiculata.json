    "intro": "Viguiera apiculata, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy composite flowers that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lobed, heart-shaped leaves. Its bright orange to red flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera apiculata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife gardens."
