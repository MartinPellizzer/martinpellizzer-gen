    "intro": "Vitis andamanica, commonly known as Andaman grapevine, is a flowering vine native to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Vitaceae family, which includes other well-known grapevines. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its tendrils help it climb and support its growth. Vitis andamanica is often found in moist, tropical habitats and is adapted to the humid climate of its native region."
