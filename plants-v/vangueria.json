    "intro": "Vangueria, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Vangueria species often have milky sap, which can be toxic, and they are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The genus is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological and medicinal significance."
