    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. palmata, commonly known as the palmate grape, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaf shape, which sets it apart from other Vitis species. The plant typically grows as a vine with tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across supports. While it is not widely used for wine production, it is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. Its berries are generally smaller and less sweet compared to those of other Vitis varieties."
