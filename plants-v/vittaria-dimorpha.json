    "intro": "Vittaria dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Vittaria dimorpha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
