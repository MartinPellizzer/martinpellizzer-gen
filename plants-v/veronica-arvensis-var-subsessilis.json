    "intro": "Veronica arvensis var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across open ground. Its leaves are typically narrow and sessile, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
