    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. davidi, commonly known as David's grape, is a rare and ancient variety of grapevine native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is characterized by its small, dark berries and vigorous growth habit, often found in rocky and arid environments. The plant is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates, making it a subject of interest for viticultural research. Its genetic lineage is closely related to other Vitis species, contributing to its unique botanical traits. Due to its rarity, it is not widely cultivated but is valued for its potential in breeding programs."
