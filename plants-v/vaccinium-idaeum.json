    "intro": "Vaccinium idaeum, commonly known as the Labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its berries are edible but have a strong, sometimes bitter flavor. Vaccinium idaeum plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
