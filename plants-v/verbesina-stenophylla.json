    "intro": "Verbesina stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, and the plant produces small, rough seeds that are easily dispersed by animals. Verbesina stenophylla is typically found in open habitats such as roadsides, prairies, and disturbed soils."
