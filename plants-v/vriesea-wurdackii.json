    "intro": "Vriesea wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central reservoir. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea wurdackii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
