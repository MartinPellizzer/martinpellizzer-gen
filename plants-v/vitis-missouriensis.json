    "intro": "Vitis missouriensis, commonly known as Missouri grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the central and eastern United States. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by round, edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in tendrils that help it climb. Missouri grape is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
