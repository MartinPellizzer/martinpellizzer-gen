    "intro": "Viola canina proles lusitana, commonly known as the Iberian violet, is a rare and endangered species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by heart-shaped leaves and delicate violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has small, hairy stems and produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
