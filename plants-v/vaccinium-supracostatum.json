    "intro": "Vaccinium supracostatum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. It has elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Vaccinium supracostatum plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing food for local wildlife."
