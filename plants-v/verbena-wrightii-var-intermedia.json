    "intro": "Verbena wrightii var. intermedia, commonly known as the Mexican verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
