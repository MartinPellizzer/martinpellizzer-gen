    "intro": "Vanhouttea calcarata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rock heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
