    "intro": "Viscum album subsp. laxum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has a dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, sticky berries. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. Viscum album subsp. laxum is often associated with festive traditions and has cultural significance in many parts of Europe."
