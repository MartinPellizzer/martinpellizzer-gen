    "intro": "Viola ganiatsasii, commonly known as the Ganiatsasii violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Georgia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
