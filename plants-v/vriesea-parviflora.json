    "intro": "Vriesea parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf vriesea, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage and vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers, which can range in color from red to orange, are borne on a central spike and are highly attractive to pollinators. Vriesea parviflora is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
