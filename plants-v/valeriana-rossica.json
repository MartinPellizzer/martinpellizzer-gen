It features a robust root system and erect, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces distinctive, aromatic leaves with a strong, spicy odor. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects on the nervous system."
