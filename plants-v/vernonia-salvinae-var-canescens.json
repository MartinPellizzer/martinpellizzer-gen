    "intro": "Vernonia salvinae var. canescens, commonly known as the silver vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
