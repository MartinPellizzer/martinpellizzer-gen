    "intro": "Verbascum sedgwickianum, commonly known as the Sedgwick mullein, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Verbascum sedgwickianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
