    "intro": "Veronicastrum stenostachyum subsp. plukenetii, commonly known as the narrow-stalked blueweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade."
