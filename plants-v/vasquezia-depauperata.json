It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its flowering period typically occurs during the rainy season, producing pale blue or purple blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vasquezia depauperata is considered a rare and endangered species."
