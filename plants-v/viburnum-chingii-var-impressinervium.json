    "intro": "Viburnum chingii var. impressinervium, commonly known as the Chinese snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features compound leaves with a distinctive veining pattern that gives it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and seasonal fruit display."
