    "intro": "Vaccinium oldhamii var. glaucinum, commonly known as the Oldham huckleberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a waxy, blue-gray coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries in late summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and potential use in native plant landscaping."
