It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a low-growing habit with trifoliate leaves that resemble the paw of a hare, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Vulneraria lagopodium is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
