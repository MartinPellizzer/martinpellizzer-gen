    "intro": "Vestia foetida, commonly known as the stinking carpet-scale, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered along the stems. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often forming dense ground cover. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes referred to as the \"stinking\" plant."
