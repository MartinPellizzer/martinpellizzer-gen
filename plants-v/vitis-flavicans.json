    "intro": "Vitis flavicans, commonly known as the yellow grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange, are edible but not as commonly cultivated as other grape varieties. Vitis flavicans plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
