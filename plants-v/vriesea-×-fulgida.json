It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can last for several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea \u00d7 fulgida is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
