    "intro": "Vatica reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its slow growth and high wood value, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
