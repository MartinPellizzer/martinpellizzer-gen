It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical climates. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded forest environments. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, and yellow, are highly sought after in horticulture for their beauty and longevity. Vanda tricolor var. russeliana requires bright, indirect light and well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
