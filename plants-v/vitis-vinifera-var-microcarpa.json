    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. microcarpa, commonly known as the Muscat of Alexandria, is a grapevine species characterized by its small, aromatic berries. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is known for its high sugar content and distinct muscat flavor. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and produces clusters of berries that are often used in winemaking. Its vines are vigorous growers, often requiring support due to their climbing habit. This variety is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display."
