    "intro": "Vatica moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, almost bark-like trunk that is highly valued for its durability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Vatica moluccana is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching heights of over 30 meters. Due to its hard wood and ecological importance, it is also recognized as a species of conservation concern."
