    "intro": "Vitis glabrata, commonly known as the sand grape or desert grape, is a deciduous vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by round, sweet-tasting berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis glabrata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species that can thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought."
