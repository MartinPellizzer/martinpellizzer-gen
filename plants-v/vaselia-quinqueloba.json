    "intro": "Vaselia quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with five distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. It produces capsule fruits that release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. V. quinqueloba is adapted to moist, sunny habitats and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
