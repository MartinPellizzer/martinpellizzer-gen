    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis subsp. collina, commonly known as mountain valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. The plant has aromatic, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It produces pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. The roots of this subspecies are used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties."
