    "intro": "Vernonia perangusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia perangusta is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
