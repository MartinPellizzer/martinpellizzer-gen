    "intro": "Veratrum maackii f. virescens, commonly known as the green-leaved white hellebore, is a variant of the white hellebore plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, distinguishing it from other forms of Veratrum. The plant produces tall, clustered flower spikes with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Like other members of the Veratrum genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and requires caution when handling."
