    "intro": "Veronica arguta, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features small, blue or purple flowers clustered in groups of two, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in cold, arid environments. Veronica arguta is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and cool temperatures."
