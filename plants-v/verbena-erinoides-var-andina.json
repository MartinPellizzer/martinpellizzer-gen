    "intro": "Verbena erinoides var. andina, commonly known as Andean verbena, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Andes mountains. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
