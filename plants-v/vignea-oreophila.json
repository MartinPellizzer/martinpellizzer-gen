    "intro": "Vignea oreophila, commonly known as the mountain vine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds. Vignea oreophila thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
