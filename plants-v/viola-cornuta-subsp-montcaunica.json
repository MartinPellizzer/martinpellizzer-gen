    "intro": "Viola cornuta subsp. montcaunica, commonly known as the Montcaun violet, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is often found in calcareous soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. The subspecies is closely related to other viola species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits."
