    "intro": "Vincentia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that produce a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, simple, and often heart-shaped leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Vincentia viscosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
