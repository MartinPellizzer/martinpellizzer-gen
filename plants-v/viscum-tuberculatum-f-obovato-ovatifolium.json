It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are obovate to ovate in shape, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue. This form is native to regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Argentina. It plays a significant ecological role by providing food and habitat for various bird species."
