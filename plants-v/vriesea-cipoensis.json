It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that can last for several months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, forming a rosette that helps collect rainwater, which is essential for its survival. Vriesea cipoensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
