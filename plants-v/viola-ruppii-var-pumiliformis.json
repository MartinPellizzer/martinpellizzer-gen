    "intro": "Viola ruppii var. pumiliformis, commonly known as the dwarf rock viola, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, typically blooming in late spring. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in harsh, high-altitude environments."
