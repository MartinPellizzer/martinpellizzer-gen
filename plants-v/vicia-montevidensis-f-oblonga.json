    "intro": "Vicia montevidensis f. oblonga, commonly known as the oblong leaf vetch, is a variant of the common vetch native to South America. This plant is characterized by its elongated, oblong leaves that distinguish it from other forms of Vicia montevidensis. It typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, showing a preference for temperate climates. The flowers are usually purple or pink, forming small clusters along the stems. It is a perennial legume that contributes to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
