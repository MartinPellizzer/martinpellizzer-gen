    "intro": "Varronia candolleana, commonly known as the yellow bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Varronia candolleana is often found in moist, tropical environments, growing along riverbanks and in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
