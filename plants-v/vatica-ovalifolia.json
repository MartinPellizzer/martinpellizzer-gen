    "intro": "Vatica ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an important species for both ecological and economic purposes."
