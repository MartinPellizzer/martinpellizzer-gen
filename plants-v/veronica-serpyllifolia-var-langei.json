It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, coastal soils. It is often found in dune environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
