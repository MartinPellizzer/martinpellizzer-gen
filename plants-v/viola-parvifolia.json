    "intro": "Viola parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple or violet. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in clusters. Viola parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
