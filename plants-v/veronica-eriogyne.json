    "intro": "Veronica eriogyne, commonly known as the silver leaf speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and long blooming period."
