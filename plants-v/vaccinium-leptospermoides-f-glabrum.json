    "intro": "Vaccinium leptospermoides f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved heath, is a variant of the slender cranberry plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other forms of the species. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which develop into small, edible berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
