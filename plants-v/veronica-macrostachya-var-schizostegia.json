    "intro": "Veronica macrostachya var. schizostegia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, terminal spikes. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
