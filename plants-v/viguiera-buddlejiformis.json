    "intro": "Viguiera buddlejiformis, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy, cone-shaped flower heads that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Viguiera buddlejiformis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
