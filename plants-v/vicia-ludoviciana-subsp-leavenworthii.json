It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink. Its fruit is a slender, dehiscent pod that releases seeds when mature. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for wildlife."
