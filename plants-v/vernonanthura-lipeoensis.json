It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, adapting to the cool and humid conditions of its native habitat. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
