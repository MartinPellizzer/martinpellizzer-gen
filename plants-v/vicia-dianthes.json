    "intro": "Vicia dianthes, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Vicia dianthes is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
