    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a subspecies native to the Caucasus region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its vigorous growth, trailing vines, and small, bitter fruits that are typically not used for winemaking. The plant has deep roots and is highly adaptable to various soil types, often thriving in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, dark berries. This wild variety is valued for its genetic diversity and is often used in breeding programs to improve cultivated grapevines."
