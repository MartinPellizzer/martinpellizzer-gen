    "intro": "Veronica teucrium subsp. pseudochamaedrys, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions."
