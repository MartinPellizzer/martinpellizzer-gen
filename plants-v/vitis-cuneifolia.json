    "intro": "Vitis cuneifolia, commonly known as the riverbank grape or swamp grape, is a species of flowering vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, sweet-tasting berries that are often used in local cuisine. The plant thrives in moist, often swampy habitats and is well adapted to riparian environments. Its vines can climb or trail along the ground, and it produces distinctive tendrils for support. Vitis cuneifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
