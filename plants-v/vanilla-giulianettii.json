    "intro": "Vanilla giulianettii, commonly known as the Italian vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is a climbing vine with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is known for its unique vanilla-like aroma, which is less intense than that of vanilla planifolia. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires a sturdy support structure for its growth. The fruit, a small, dark brown pod, is harvested and used in culinary applications."
