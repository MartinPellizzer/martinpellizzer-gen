    "intro": "Vitis longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf grapevine, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue to black berries. Vitis longifolia is often found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural use."
