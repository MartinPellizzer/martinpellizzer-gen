    "intro": "Vernonia tereticaulis, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia tereticaulis is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous roots and dense foliage make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
