    "intro": "Vanilla verrucosa, commonly known as the rough vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. The plant's fruits are small, dark purple berries that contain the seeds used in vanilla extraction. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. This species is valued for its unique aroma and is sometimes cultivated for commercial use."
