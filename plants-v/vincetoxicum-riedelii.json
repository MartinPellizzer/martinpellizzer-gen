    "intro": "Vincetoxicum riedelii, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful if ingested. Vincetoxicum riedelii is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
