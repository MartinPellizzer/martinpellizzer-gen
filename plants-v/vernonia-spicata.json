    "intro": "Vernonia spicata, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Vernonia spicata is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
