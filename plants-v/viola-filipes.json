    "intro": "Viola filipes, commonly known as the trailing violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or blue-violet flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Viola filipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
