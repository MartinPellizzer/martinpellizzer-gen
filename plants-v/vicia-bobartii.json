It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Vicia bobartii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
