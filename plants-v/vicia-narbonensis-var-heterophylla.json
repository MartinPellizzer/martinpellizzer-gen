    "intro": "Vicia narbonensis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This variety is noted for its variability in leaf morphology, which contributes to its classification as a variant."
