    "intro": "Vitis sylvestris var. sativa, commonly known as the common grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to berries, which are typically purple or black when mature. These berries are rich in sugars and have been cultivated for thousands of years for wine, juice, and food. The plant's vigorous growth and adaptability make it an important species in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
