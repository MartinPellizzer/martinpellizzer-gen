    "intro": "Vaccinium corymbodendron, commonly known as the Florida huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and it typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Vaccinium corymbodendron is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies in its native habitat."
