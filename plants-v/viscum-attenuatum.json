    "intro": "Viscum attenuatum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees such as oak and apple. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds, aiding in its dispersal by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host tree, as it cannot complete its life cycle without it. Viscum attenuatum is often associated with Christmas traditions, though it has a long history of use in various cultures."
