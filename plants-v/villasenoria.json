    "intro": "Villasenoria, commonly known as the \"Mexican bluebells,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plants typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. Their leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems, while the flowers are clustered in racemes. Villasenoria species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
