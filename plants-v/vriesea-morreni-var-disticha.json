It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that typically displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, supporting its epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers bloom in a spiral pattern, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
