    "intro": "Villebrunea murina, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and is often found growing along shores and in sandy soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Villebrunea murina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its resilience to salt spray."
