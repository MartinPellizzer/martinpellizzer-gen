    "intro": "Vaccinium coriaceum var. coriaceum, commonly known as the leatherleaf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are thick, leathery, and dark green, providing year-round interest. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers appear in spring, followed by edible, blue-black berries that are rich in antioxidants. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and its ability to support local wildlife."
