    "intro": "Viburnum lantana var. discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green above and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like drupes in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage color changes and attractive fruit display."
