It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are followed by long, flat pods containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in savannas and rocky habitats. Vachellia kosiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
