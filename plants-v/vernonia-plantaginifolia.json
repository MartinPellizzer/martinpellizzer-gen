    "intro": "Vernonia plantaginifolia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia plantaginifolia is a popular choice for native gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
