    "intro": "Veratrum californicum, commonly known as California aconite, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, smooth-stemmed structure and large, showy white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic to both humans and animals. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Despite its beauty, it should be handled with care due to its high toxicity."
