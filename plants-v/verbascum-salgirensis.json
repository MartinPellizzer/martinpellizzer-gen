    "intro": "Verbascum salgirensis, commonly known as the Salgirian mullein, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh, sandy soils. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
