    "intro": "Vexatorella obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions."
