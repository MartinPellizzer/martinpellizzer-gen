    "intro": "Vaccinium carneolum var. nesophilum, commonly known as the alpine blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces edible, blue-black berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
