    "intro": "Vicia unijuga var. waldeniana, commonly known as the Walden's vetch, is a rare and specialized legume species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant possesses trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
