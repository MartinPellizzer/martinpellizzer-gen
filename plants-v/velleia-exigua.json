    "intro": "Velleia exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf velleia, is a small flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, opposite leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. Its small white or pale blue flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Velleia exigua is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
