    "intro": "Vandellia chrysoplectra, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the humid rainforests of Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped lip, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a loose inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vandellia chrysoplectra is considered a conservation concern."
