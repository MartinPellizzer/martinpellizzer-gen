    "intro": "Veronicastrum serpyllifolium subsp. humifusum, commonly known as the low veronica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is often found in grassy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
