    "intro": "Vicia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually purple or violet in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Vicia atlantica is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
