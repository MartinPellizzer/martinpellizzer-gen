    "intro": "Vaccaria hispanica subsp. liniflora, commonly known as the slender sandweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for certain pollinators."
