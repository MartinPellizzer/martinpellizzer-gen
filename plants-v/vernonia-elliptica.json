    "intro": "Vernonia elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that are covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are elliptic in shape with a pointed tip. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Vernonia elliptica is often found in moist, open woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
