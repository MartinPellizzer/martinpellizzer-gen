    "intro": "Vicia lenticula, commonly known as the lens vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, contributing to its common name. Vicia lenticula is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
