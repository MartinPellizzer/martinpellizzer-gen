    "intro": "Varronia alnifolia, commonly known as the white cedar or white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to coastal regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are white or pale pink and are borne in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Varronia alnifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial species."
