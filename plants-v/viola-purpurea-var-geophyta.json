It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy violet-blue flowers with yellow markings, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive harsh winter conditions and regrow each year."
