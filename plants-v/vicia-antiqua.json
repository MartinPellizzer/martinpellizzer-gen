    "intro": "Vicia antiqua, commonly known as the ancient vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Vicia antiqua is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
