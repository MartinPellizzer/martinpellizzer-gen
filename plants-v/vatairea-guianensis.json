    "intro": "Vatairea guianensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua\u00e7u* tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits resembling small cherries. Its fruit is rich in nutrients, including antioxidants and vitamins, making it valuable in both traditional and modern medicine. The tree also plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
