    "intro": "Vincetoxicum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved ironweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, purple to reddish-pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in partial shade. Vincetoxicum angustifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
