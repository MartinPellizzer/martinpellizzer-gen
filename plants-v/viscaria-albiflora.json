It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats along the ground. Viscaria albiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
