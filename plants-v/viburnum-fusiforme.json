    "intro": "Viburnum fusiforme, commonly known as the spindle viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring slender, cylindrical stems that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. Viburnum fusiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
