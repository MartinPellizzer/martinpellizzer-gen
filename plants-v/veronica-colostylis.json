    "intro": "Veronica colostylis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. Veronica colostylis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
