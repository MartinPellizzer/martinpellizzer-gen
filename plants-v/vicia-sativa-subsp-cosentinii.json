    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. cosentinii, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its slender, trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
