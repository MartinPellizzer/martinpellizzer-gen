    "intro": "Visiania undulata, commonly known as the wavy leaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, wavy-edged leaves that are typically green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Due to its rapid growth, it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from becoming invasive."
