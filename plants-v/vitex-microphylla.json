    "intro": "Vitex microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, fragrant, blue to purple flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vitex microphylla is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
