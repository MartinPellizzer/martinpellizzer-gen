    "intro": "Vallisneria natans var. higoensis, commonly known as the Higoensis waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of elongated, fleshy fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native waters."
