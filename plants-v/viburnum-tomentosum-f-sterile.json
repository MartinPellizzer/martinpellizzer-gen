    "intro": "Viburnum tomentosum f. sterile, commonly known as the sterile form of the snowberry viburnum, is a botanical variant characterized by its lack of reproductive structures. This form typically exhibits the same ornamental features as the typical species, including white flowers and red berries, but fails to produce viable seeds. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The plant retains the same growth habit, with dense, rounded foliage and a shrub-like structure. Its sterile nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes without the risk of unwanted seed dispersal."
