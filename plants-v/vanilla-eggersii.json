    "intro": "Vanilla eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, greenish pods. The plant thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its vanilla-like scent is more subtle compared to the commercial vanilla orchid, Vanilla planifolia. The pods, which mature to a dark brown color, contain aromatic seeds that are sometimes used in culinary applications."
