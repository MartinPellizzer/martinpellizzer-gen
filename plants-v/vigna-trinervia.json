    "intro": "Vigna trinervia, commonly known as the small cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small leaflets, and its erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein. Vigna trinervia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting subsequent crop growth."
