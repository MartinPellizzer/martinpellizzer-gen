    "intro": "Veratrum helleboraster, commonly known as the Japanese white helleborine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant contains various alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring caution during handling."
