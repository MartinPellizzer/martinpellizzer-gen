    "intro": "Viburnum sargentii var. puberulum, commonly known as the smoothleaf snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
