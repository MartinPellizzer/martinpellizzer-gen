    "intro": "Vitis vulpina var. riparia, commonly known as the riverbank grape, is a perennial vine native to North America. It thrives in moist, riparian habitats and is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of edible, sweet berries in the summer. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects. The berries are also a food source for various wildlife species."
