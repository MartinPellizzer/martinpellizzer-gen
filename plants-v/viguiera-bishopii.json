    "intro": "Viguiera bishopii, commonly known as the bishop's bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of blue-gray, hairy leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Viguiera bishopii is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
