    "intro": "Verbascum eremocharis, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant features tall, hairy stems that support large, gray-green leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, forming upright clusters at the top of the plant. Verbascum eremocharis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
