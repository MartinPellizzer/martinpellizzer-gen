    "intro": "Valeriana heterophylla, commonly known as the variable valerian, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its roots contain volatile oils and have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their sedative properties."
