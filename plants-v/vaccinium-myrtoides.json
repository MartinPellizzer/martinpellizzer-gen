    "intro": "Vaccinium myrtoides, commonly known as the sandplain blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal plains of the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 feet and features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, blue-black berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to sandy or coastal environments. Vaccinium myrtoides is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
