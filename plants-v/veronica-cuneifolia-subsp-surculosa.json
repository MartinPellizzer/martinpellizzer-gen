    "intro": "Veronica cuneifolia subsp. surculosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and vibrant blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
