    "intro": "Vitis cinerea var. baileyana, commonly known as Bailey's grapevines, is a rare and distinctive vine species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pale green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are typically not edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
