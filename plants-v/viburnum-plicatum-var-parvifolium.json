    "intro": "Viburnum plicatum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely cut, lace-like leaves that create a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This ornamental plant is valued for its elegant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
