    "intro": "Vaccinium crinigerum, commonly known as the silverleaf huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically silver or grayish-white on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its berries are dark blue to black and are edible, though they are not as widely consumed as other Vaccinium species. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
