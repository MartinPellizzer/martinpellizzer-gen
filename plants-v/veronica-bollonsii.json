    "intro": "Veronica bollonsii, commonly known as the Bollonsii speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
