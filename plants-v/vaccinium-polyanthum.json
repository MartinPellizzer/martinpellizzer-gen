    "intro": "Vaccinium polyanthum, commonly known as the evergreen blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun for optimal growth. Its berries, which are edible, are usually dark blue or purple when ripe and have a tart flavor. Vaccinium polyanthum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
