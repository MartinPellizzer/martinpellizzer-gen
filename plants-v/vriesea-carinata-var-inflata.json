    "intro": "Vriesea carinata var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, and its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces showy, spathaceous bracts in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
