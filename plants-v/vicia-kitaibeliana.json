It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in dry and sandy soils. Vicia kitaibeliana is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
