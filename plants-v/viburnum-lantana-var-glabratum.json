    "intro": "Viburnum lantana var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually smooth and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
