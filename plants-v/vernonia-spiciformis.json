    "intro": "Vernonia spiciformis, commonly known as the spike vervain, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, slender stems make it easily identifiable. Vernonia spiciformis produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall."
