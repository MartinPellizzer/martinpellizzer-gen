    "intro": "Veronica lutea, commonly known as the yellow speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in early summer. Veronica lutea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
