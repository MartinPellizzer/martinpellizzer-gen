    "intro": "Verbascum hyoseridifolium, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose spike at the top of the stem. Its leaves are large, broad, and gradually narrow towards the base, often covered in a fuzzy texture. Verbascum hyoseridifolium thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
