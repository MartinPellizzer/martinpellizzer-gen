It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, aromatic, dark purple berries. The plant produces heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, which have a sweet, musky flavor. Vitis regeliana is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
