    "intro": "Vernonia geminata, commonly known as the twinleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer. Vernonia geminata is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
