    "intro": "Verbena officinalis var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, violet, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
