    "intro": "Vernonia halimifolia, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, upright stems that bear clusters of small, purple to blue flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
