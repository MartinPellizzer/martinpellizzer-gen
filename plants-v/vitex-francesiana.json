    "intro": "Vitex francesiana, commonly known as the Frances' chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in clusters, usually in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a smooth, woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Vitex francesiana is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
