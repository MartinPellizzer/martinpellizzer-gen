    "intro": "Vernonia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are usually lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
