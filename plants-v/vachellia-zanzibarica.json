    "intro": "Vachellia zanzibarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar umbrella thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its umbrella-like arrangement of branches and long, thin, thornless stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found near the coast, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes. Vachellia zanzibarica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
