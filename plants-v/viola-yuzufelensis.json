    "intro": "Viola yuzufelensis, commonly known as the Yuzufelensis violet, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Viola. It is native to specific regions in Asia, particularly in parts of China and Korea. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple and violet. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
