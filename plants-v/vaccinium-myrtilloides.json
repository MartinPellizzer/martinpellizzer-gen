    "intro": "Vaccinium myrtilloides, commonly known as the small blueberry shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and swamps. The leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value."
