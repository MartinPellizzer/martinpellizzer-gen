    "intro": "Vriesea ovandensis, commonly known as the Ovandensis Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, often in red, orange, or yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its flowers are typically short-lived but highly showy, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Vriesea ovandensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indoor environments."
