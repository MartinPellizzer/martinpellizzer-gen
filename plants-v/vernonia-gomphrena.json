    "intro": "Vernonia gomphrena, commonly known as the everlasting flower or red ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flower clusters that resemble small spheres, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia gomphrena is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ability to retain its color and form when dried makes it a favored plant for floral arrangements."
