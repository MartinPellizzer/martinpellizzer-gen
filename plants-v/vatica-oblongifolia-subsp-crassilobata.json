    "intro": "Vatica oblongifolia subsp. crassilobata, commonly known as the thick-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are thick and leathery, often with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its hard wood and ecological importance, it is valued both for its timber and its role in forest ecosystems."
