    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water speedwell, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to white flowers. The leaves are typically broad and opposite, with a glossy surface that helps it thrive in moist conditions. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize wet areas make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
