    "intro": "Vanilla tolypephora, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Madagascar. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's vines can grow up to several meters long, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its vanilla pods, which develop from the flower, are harvested and dried to produce the highly prized vanilla flavoring. This species is closely related to the more commercially known vanilla planifolia."
