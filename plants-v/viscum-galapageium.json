    "intro": "Viscum galapageium, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily Palo Santo (Bursera graveolens), through its sticky seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host via its haustoria. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are important for local wildlife. Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the balance of the island's unique ecosystem."
