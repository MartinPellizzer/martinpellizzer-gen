    "intro": "Vaccinium eymae, commonly known as the Eymae blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like heathers and cranberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue or black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool climate with adequate moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
