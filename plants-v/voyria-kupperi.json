    "intro": "Voyria kupperi, commonly known as the Kupper's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. Its fleshy, succulent leaves help it store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Voyria kupperi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
