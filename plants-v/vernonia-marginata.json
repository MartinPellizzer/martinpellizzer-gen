    "intro": "Vernonia marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its striking purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish margin, giving the plant its common name."
