    "intro": "Vanilla humblotii, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by long, serpentine pods containing the aromatic vanilla beans. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its vanilla beans are prized for their distinct flavor profile, which is often described as more floral and less sweet than traditional vanilla. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vanilla humblotii is considered a rare and endangered species."
