    "intro": "Veronica islensis, commonly known as the island speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a low-growing herb with small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the unique climate of its island habitat. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
