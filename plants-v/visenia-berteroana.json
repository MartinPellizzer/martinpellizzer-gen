    "intro": "Visenia berteroana, commonly known as the Andean ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Ulmaceae, which includes elms and ashes, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by wind, followed by the development of small, winged seeds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
