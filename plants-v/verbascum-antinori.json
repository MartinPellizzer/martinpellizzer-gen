    "intro": "Verbascum antinori, commonly known as the Antinori's mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum antinori is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
