    "intro": "Vimen uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically red or dark purple in color, especially in the autumn. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound used in traditional medicine for its urinary tract benefits. Vimen uva-ursi thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments."
