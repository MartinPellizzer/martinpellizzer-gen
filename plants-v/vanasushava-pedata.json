    "intro": "Vanasushava pedata, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soil conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels contributes to its ecological significance in riparian zones."
