    "intro": "Vahlodea latifolia subsp. paramushirensis, commonly known as the Paramushire narrowleaf, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
