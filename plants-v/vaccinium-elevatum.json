    "intro": "Vaccinium elevatum, commonly known as the highbush blueberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright blue, juicy berries in the summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are widely used in culinary applications. Vaccinium elevatum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
