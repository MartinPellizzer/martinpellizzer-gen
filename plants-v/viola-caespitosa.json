    "intro": "Viola caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, violet or purple flowers with five petals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its ability to form dense mats through its creeping rhizomes. Viola caespitosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
