    "intro": "Viscaria alpina subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves and produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its morphology includes a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Viscaria alpina subsp. borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky areas."
