    "intro": "Verbascum trapifolium var. trapifolium, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy gray-green hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense, candle-like inflorescence. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical medicinal uses."
