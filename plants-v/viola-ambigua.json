    "intro": "Viola ambigua, commonly known as the yellow violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by two smaller, spurred petals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Viola ambigua is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
