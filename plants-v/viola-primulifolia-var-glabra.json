    "intro": "Viola primulifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth viola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, blooming in early spring. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and early blooming period."
