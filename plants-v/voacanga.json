    "intro": "Voacanga, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It includes several species, such as Voacanga abyssinica and Voacanga africana, which are native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in forest understories. Some species of Voacanga have been studied for their potential medicinal properties, though they contain toxic alkaloids."
