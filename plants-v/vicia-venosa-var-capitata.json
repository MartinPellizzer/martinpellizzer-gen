    "intro": "Vicia venosa var. capitata, commonly known as the clustered vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, giving it its varietal name. Its pods are slender and contain several elliptical seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
