    "intro": "Vanilla gardneri, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla orchid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It produces fragrant, dark brown pods that are harvested for their vanilla extract, though it is less commercially significant than Vanilla planifolia. The plant has a complex flowering cycle, with blooms appearing in clusters and often being short-lived. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
