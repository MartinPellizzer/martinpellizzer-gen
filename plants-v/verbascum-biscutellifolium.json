    "intro": "Verbascum biscutellifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in dense, velvety hair. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
