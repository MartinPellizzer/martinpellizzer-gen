    "intro": "Verbascum compactum, commonly known as the compact mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often growing in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum compactum is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and soothing properties."
