    "intro": "Verbena carolina var. glabra, commonly known as smooth verbena, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and smooth to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies add to its horticultural value."
