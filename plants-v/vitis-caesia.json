    "intro": "Vitis caesia, commonly known as the sweet white grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, edible berries. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and twining stems, which allow it to climb and spread along forest edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Vitis caesia is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
