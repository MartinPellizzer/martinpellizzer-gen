    "intro": "Vaccinium amplifolium var. stabilipes, commonly known as the stable-footed blueberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
