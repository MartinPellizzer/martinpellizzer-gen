It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, typically blooming in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. Valeriana poterioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
