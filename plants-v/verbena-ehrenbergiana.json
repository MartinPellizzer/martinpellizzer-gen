    "intro": "Verbena ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its succulent-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Verbena ehrenbergiana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
