    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. grisea, commonly known as the gray grape vine, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its pale to grayish-blue berries, which are typically smaller than those of more commercially popular grape varieties. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its foliage is often a deep green, and it produces clusters of fruit that are sometimes used in small-scale winemaking or culinary applications. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
