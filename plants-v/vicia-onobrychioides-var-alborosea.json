    "intro": "Vicia onobrychioides var. alborosea, commonly known as the white-hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Its hairy leaves and stems are adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a cover crop."
