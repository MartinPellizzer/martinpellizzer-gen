    "intro": "Vincetoxicum velutinum, commonly known as velvet leaf false bindweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
