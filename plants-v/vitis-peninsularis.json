    "intro": "Vitis peninsularis, commonly known as the Florida grapevine, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to humid, subtropical climates and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its fruits, which are small and often sour, are not typically consumed by humans but are used by wildlife. Vitis peninsularis plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
