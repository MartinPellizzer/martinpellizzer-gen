    "intro": "Vernonia pinheiroi, commonly known as the Cape Verde vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky areas, adapting to the arid and saline conditions of its native habitat. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
