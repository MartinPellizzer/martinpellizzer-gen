It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are oval and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Vaccinium pubescens thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments."
