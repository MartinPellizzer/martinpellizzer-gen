    "intro": "Vallaris arborea, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Vallaris arborea is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in urban environments. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
