    "intro": "Vanilla guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan vanilla orchid, is a climbing vine native to Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's most notable feature is its dark brown, aromatic pods, which are harvested and cured to yield vanilla extract. The botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. This species is closely related to the commercially cultivated vanilla orchid, Vanilla planifolia."
