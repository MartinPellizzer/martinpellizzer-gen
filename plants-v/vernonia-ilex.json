    "intro": "Vernonia ilex, commonly known as the silverleaf vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the summer months. Vernonia ilex is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
