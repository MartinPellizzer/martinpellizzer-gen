It is characterized by its vibrant, tri-colored petals that display shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom during the summer months. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
