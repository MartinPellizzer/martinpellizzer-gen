It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically three-veined, giving the plant its scientific name, and they are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in racemes, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
