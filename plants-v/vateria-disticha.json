    "intro": "Vateria disticha, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in tropical forest environments. Vateria disticha is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
