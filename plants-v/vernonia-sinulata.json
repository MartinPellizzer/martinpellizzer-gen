    "intro": "Vernonia sinulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes, often forming dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green color, and it produces small, purple to pink flowers in late summer. Vernonia sinulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
