    "intro": "Vaccinium glaucoalbum, commonly known as the silver-white blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that have a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. These flowers give way to edible, bright blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. Vaccinium glaucoalbum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats."
