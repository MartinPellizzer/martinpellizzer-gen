    "intro": "Vincetoxicum pumilum, commonly known as smallleaf false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Vincetoxicum pumilum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
