    "intro": "Verbascum strictum, commonly known as the tall mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, velvety gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, upright spike. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture, while its flowers are rich in nectar, attracting bees and other pollinators. Verbascum strictum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is commonly used in herbal medicine for its potential soothing properties."
