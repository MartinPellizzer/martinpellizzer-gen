    "intro": "Veratronia malayana, commonly known as the Malay star anise, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the star anise, though it is not related to the true star anise. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
