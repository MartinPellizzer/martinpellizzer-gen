    "intro": "Vriesea schenkiana, commonly known as the Schenk's Vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant features a rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often green with white or silver markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea schenkiana is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
