    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vetenata subenervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined grass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
