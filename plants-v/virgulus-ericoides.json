    "intro": "Virgulus ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, evergreen leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
