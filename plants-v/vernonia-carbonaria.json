    "intro": "Vernonia carbonaria, commonly known as the blackstem ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as swamps and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture. Vernonia carbonaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
