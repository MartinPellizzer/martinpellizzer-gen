    "intro": "Vitekorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the shade of the forest canopy. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, relying on air, rain, and debris for nutrients. Vitekorchis has a short flowering period, typically during the rainy season, and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
