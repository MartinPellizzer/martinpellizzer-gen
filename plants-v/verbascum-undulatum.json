    "intro": "Verbascum undulatum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a bract-like structure at the top of the stem. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a similar fuzzy coating, aiding in water retention. Verbascum undulatum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
