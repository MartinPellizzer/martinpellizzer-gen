    "intro": "Viguiera grandiflora f. typica, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features upright stems covered in stiff, grayish-green leaves and produces showy, purple to pinkish-red composite flowers in late summer. Its flowers are composed of many small, tubular florets arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. Viguiera grandiflora f. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water."
