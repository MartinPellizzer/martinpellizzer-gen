It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and sandy areas. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet at the top of the stem, which contains small, wind-pollinated flowers.
