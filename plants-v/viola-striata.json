    "intro": "Viola striata, commonly known as the streaked violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive dark green color and white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers have five petals with a characteristic dark stripe, and it is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Viola striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
