    "intro": "Vanieria bodinieri, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its enormous, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant has a thick, spongy petiole that provides buoyancy and support for its massive leaves. Its flowers are typically pink or white, emerging from the water surface and blooming at night. Vanieria bodinieri plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to nutrient cycling in the ecosystem."
