    "intro": "Verbena remota, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, opposite leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbena remota is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
