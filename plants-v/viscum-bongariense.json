    "intro": "Viscum bongariense, commonly known as the Bongariene mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Viscum bongariense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries."
