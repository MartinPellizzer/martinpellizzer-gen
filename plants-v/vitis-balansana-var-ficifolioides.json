    "intro": "Vitis balansana var. ficifolioides, commonly known as the fig-leaf grape, is a variant of the Balansana vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the common fig tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered grapes that are typically green and sometimes turn reddish when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. The botanical features of this variant make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Vitis genus."
