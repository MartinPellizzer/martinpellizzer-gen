    "intro": "Vatica lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
