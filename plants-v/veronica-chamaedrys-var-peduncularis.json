    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys var. peduncularis, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This hardy species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its resilience and ornamental value."
