    "intro": "Veronica nodiflora, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
