    "intro": "Vicia biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in pairs along the stem. Its compound leaves consist of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation. Vicia biflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve soil fertility."
