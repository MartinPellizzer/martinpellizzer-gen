It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Vicia argaea is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
