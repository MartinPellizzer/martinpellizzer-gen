    "intro": "Vicia splendens, commonly known as the golden vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial legume that produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Vicia splendens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and can be found in gardens and natural habitats."
