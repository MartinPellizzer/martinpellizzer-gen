    "intro": "Viburnum jucundum, commonly known as sweet viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Viburnum jucundum typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, making it a popular choice for gardens."
