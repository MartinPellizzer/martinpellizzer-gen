    "intro": "Viola palustris var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with five petals, often with a yellow throat, during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stems compared to other viola species, making it a unique and recognizable member of the Violaceae family."
