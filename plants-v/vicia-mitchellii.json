    "intro": "Vicia mitchellii, commonly known as Mitchell's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, spindly growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Vicia mitchellii plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
