    "intro": "Vernonia arborea, commonly known as the tree ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wooded areas. The plant produces clusters of small, spiky, purple to brown flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture with a slight pubescence. Vernonia arborea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
