    "intro": "Vanilla purusara, commonly known as the sacred vanilla of the Amazon, is a climbing orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow pods that mature into dark brown vanilla beans, similar to the more well-known Vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are pollinated by specific bees, making it a rare and challenging crop to cultivate. The vanilla beans are harvested, dried, and used in culinary and aromatic applications."
