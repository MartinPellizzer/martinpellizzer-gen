    "intro": "Verbena townsendii, commonly known as Townsend's verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbena townsendii is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
