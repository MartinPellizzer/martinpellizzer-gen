    "intro": "Vriesea \u00d7 tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vriesea, is a hybrid bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a compact, elegant shape. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea \u00d7 tenuis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
