    "intro": "Vitex glabrata, commonly known as the champa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to purple, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its natural distribution. Vitex glabrata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in medicine and horticulture."
