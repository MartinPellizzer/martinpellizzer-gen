    "intro": "Verbena arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
