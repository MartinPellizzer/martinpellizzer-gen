    "intro": "Viola viarum, commonly known as the wandering violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and gardens. The flowers are typically five-petaled and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Viola viarum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
