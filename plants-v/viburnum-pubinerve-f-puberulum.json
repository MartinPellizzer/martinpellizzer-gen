It features small, ovate leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a valuable ornamental plant. It prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, thriving in temperate climates."
