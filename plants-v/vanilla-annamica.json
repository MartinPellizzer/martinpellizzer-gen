    "intro": "Vanilla annamica, commonly known as the Annam vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It produces fragrant, dark brown vanilla pods that are harvested and processed for their aromatic essence. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and white, often overlooked despite their role in the reproductive cycle. The vanilla flavor derived from this species is highly valued in culinary and fragrance industries."
