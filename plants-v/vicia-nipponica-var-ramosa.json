It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Vicia nipponica var. ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
