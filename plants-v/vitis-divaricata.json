    "intro": "Vitis divaricata, commonly known as the Chinese wild grape, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of round, edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Vitis divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
