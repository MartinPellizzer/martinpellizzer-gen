    "intro": "Viola prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate violet, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Viola prostrata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
