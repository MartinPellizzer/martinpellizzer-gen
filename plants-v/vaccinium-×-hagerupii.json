    "intro": "Vaccinium \u00d7 hagerupii, commonly known as the Hagerup blueberry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Vaccinium corymbosum (blueberry) and Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its erect growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which develop into edible, blue-black berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. Vaccinium \u00d7 hagerupii is a hardy plant that is well-suited for cooler climates and partial shade."
