    "intro": "Viscum wightianum, commonly known as the Wight's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaceae. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. Its small, white or pale green flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Viscum wightianum plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
