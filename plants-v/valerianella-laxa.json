    "intro": "Valerianella laxa, commonly known as garden sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Valerianella laxa is typically found in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine."
