    "intro": "Vellozia canelinha, commonly known as the Brazilian flame tree, is a striking plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Podostemaceae and is characterized by its unique, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in vibrant red or orange hues. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments along riverbanks and in swampy areas. Its leaves are opposite and elongated, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Vellozia canelinha is also notable for its small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
