    "intro": "Vaccinium puberulum var. jauaense, commonly known as the Jauaense blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with short, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate for optimal growth. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential as a fruit crop in suitable environments."
