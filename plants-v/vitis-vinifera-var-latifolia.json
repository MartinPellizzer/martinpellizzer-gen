    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf grapevine, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and vigorous growth habit. This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. While it is not widely used for wine production, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardiness. Its berries are typically smaller and less sweet compared to those of Vitis vinifera var. vinifera."
