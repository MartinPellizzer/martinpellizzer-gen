    "intro": "Viguiera urticiformis, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture, while its flowers range from pale yellow to orange in color. Viguiera urticiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
