    "intro": "Viracocha lutheri, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Viracocha lutheri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
