It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a globose, woody capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Vitex flabelliflora is valued in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for its ornamental value."
