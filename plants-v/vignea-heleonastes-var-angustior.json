It features slender, twining stems that can reach several meters in length, often climbing along supports or other vegetation. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in axillary inflorescences, and are often pale yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
