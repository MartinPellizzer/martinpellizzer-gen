    "intro": "Verbena pulchella var. clavellata, commonly known as the clustered verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are opposite along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
