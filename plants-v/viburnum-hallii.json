    "intro": "Viburnum hallii, commonly known as the Hall's viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. Viburnum hallii thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowering display, and seasonal fruit production."
