    "intro": "Vincetoxicum officinale var. acutatum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved milkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a pointed tip, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic to animals and humans if ingested. This species is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
