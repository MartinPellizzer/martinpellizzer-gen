    "intro": "Vernonia punctulata, commonly known as the dotted ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple or black spot at the base. Vernonia punctulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
