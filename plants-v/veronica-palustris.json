It typically grows in moist soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slight hairy texture. Veronica palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
