    "intro": "Vicia punctata, commonly known as the spotted vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Its pods are slender and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Vicia punctata is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
