    "intro": "Verbesina heterophylla, commonly known as the variable beggar-ticks, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from ovate to lanceolate, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, hairy seeds enclosed in a bristly capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it an important species in ecological studies of plant resilience."
