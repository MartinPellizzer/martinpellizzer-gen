    "intro": "Vernonanthura paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals and a distinctive throat. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Vernonanthura paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
