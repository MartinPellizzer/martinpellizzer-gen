    "intro": "Verbascum dumulosum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects."
