    "intro": "Vernonia glomerata, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, spherical clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Vernonia glomerata is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
