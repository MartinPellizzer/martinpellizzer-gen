It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Varronia verbenacea is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
