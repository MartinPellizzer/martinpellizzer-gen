    "intro": "Vitis lowii, commonly known as the Low's grapevine, is a species of flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by clusters of small, round berries. Vitis lowii is typically found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to thrive in partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
