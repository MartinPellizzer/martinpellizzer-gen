It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy yellow petals. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, while its stems are woody and often branched. Verbesina oligactis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by a crown-like structure of bracts, giving it its common name."
