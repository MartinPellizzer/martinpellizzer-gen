    "intro": "Vitellaria mammosa, commonly known as shea tree or butter tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its thick, buttressed roots and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical fruits that contain a hard, stony seed. The seeds are valued for their high oil content, which is used to produce shea butter, a key ingredient in cosmetics and traditional medicines. The plant plays an important ecological and economic role in the regions where it is found."
