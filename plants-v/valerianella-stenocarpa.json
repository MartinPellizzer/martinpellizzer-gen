    "intro": "Valerianella stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited valerian, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Valerianaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance. Valerianella stenocarpa is also known for its mild aromatic properties, though it is not as widely cultivated as other valerian species."
