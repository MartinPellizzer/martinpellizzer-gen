It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy perennial suitable for gardens and natural habitats. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a desirable addition to native plant collections."
