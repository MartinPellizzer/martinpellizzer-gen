    "intro": "Vera-duthiea, commonly known as the golden starflower, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals that resemble small stars, which bloom during the short summer months. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, vera-duthiea is considered a vulnerable species."
