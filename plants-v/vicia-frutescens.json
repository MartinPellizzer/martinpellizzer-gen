    "intro": "Vicia frutescens, commonly known as the bush vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. Vicia frutescens is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
