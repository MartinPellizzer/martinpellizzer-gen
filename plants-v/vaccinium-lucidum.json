    "intro": "Vaccinium lucidum, commonly known as the shining blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the blue-black berries it produces. The berries are edible, though they are generally smaller and less sweet compared to commercial blueberries."
