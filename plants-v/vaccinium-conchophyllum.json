    "intro": "Vaccinium conchophyllum, commonly known as the shell-leaf cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many species of heathers and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its often-saline habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are similar in taste to true cranberries. This species is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates with high humidity and salt spray."
