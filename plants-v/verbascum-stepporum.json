    "intro": "Verbascum stepporum, commonly known as the steppe mullein, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring tall, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in soft, downy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a dense, spike-like cluster, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in dry, well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. Verbascum stepporum is often found in open grasslands and along rocky slopes."
