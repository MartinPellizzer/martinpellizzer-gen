It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by edible berries that are bright red when mature. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in traditional cuisine and herbal medicine. The plant prefers acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
