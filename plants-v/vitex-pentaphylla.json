    "intro": "Vitex pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf chaste tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves that are typically five-lobed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Vitex pentaphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
