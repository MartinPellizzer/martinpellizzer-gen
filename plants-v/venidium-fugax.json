    "intro": "Venidium fugax, commonly known as the transient vine, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a small, capsule that splits open to release minute seeds. Venidium fugax is often found in disturbed wetland habitats and is known for its short-lived growth cycle."
