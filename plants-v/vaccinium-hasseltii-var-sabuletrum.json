    "intro": "Vaccinium hasseltii var. sabuletrum, commonly known as the sandplain blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal sandplain regions of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but tart. Its leaves are oval and leathery, with a dense, compact growth habit that helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. This variety is particularly valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing food for wildlife."
