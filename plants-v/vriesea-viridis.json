    "intro": "Vriesea viridis, commonly known as the Green Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea viridis is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
