It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, bearing clusters of small, fragrant white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana officinalis subsp. excelsa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
