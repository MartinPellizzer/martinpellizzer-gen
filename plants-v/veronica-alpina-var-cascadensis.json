    "intro": "Veronica alpina var. cascadensis, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its harsh habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
