    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. laconiata, commonly known as the Laconiata grape, is a rare and ancient variety of vine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant exhibits a robust growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it withstand dry conditions. It is primarily cultivated for its unique flavor profile, which is often described as intense and complex. Due to its low yield and specific growing requirements, it is considered a specialty variety in viticulture."
