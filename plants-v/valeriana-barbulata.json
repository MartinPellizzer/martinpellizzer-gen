    "intro": "Valeriana barbulata, commonly known as the velvet root or garden valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomatous growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Valeriana barbulata is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
