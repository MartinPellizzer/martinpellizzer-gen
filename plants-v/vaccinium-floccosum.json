It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue or black when mature. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
