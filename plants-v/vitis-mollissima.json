    "intro": "Vitis mollissima, commonly known as the sand grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of small, sweet-tasting berries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its stems are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its scientific name \"mollissima,\" which means soft or downy. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
