    "intro": "Vriesea myriantha, commonly known as the \"Crimson Star\" bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that curve inward, forming a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red and yellow bracts that resemble a star, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its flowers are short-lived but often followed by the development of offsets, allowing for propagation. Vriesea myriantha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
