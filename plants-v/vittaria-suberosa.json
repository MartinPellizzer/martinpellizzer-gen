    "intro": "Vittaria suberosa, commonly known as the woolly fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly coating of trichomes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually unbranched and produce sporangia on the underside, which are clustered in sori. Vittaria suberosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
