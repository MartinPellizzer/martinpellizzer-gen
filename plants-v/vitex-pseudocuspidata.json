    "intro": "Vitex pseudocuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chaste tree, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in the summer. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Vitex pseudocuspidata is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
