    "intro": "Viguiera obtusifolia, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and Mexico. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 6 feet tall, covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow-orange flowers with dark brown centers, which bloom from late summer to fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. Viguiera obtusifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildflower gardens."
