    "intro": "Vriesea saundersii, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble a rainbow, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that emerge from the center of the inflorescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea saundersii is popular as a decorative plant due to its long-lasting, showy appearance."
