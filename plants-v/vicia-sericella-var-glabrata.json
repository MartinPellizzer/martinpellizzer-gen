    "intro": "Vicia sericella var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
