    "intro": "Vesiculina tenella, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a green alga that thrives in marine environments. It forms dense, gelatinous mats on rocky substrates, often in shallow coastal waters. The plant has a simple structure with a thallus that is flat and ribbon-like, composed of a single layer of cells. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with spores released into the water to colonize new areas. Vesiculina tenella plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
