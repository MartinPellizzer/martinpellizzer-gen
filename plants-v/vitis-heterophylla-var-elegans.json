    "intro": "Vitis heterophylla var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant grapevine, is a rare and unique species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either lobed or simple depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple color. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
