    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hirundinaria, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its striking, arrowhead-shaped leaves and clusters of red, poisonous berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are white or pale green and appear in early summer, followed by the development of its toxic berries in late summer. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
