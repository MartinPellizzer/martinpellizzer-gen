    "intro": "Valeriana crinii subsp. crinii, commonly known as the garden valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes. Its root system is fibrous and contains the essential oils responsible for its distinctive, sometimes pleasant aroma. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
