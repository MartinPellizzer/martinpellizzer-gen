    "intro": "Vanda jainii, commonly known as the Jain's vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Vanda jainii has long, strap-like leaves and blooms in clusters during the warm season. It requires bright light and good air circulation to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
