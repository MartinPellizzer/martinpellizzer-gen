    "intro": "Vitis wenxianensis, commonly known as the Wenxian grape, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Vitaceae family, characterized by its climbing vines and tendrils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its berries are usually dark purple or black when mature, and the leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
