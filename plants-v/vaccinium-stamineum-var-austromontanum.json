    "intro": "Vaccinium stamineum var. austromontanum, commonly known as the Australian heath, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. The berries it produces are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in jams and culinary applications."
