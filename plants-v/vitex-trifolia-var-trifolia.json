    "intro": "Vitex trifolia var. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved chaste tree, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds."
