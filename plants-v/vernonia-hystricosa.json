It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, dark violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it adaptable to various soil types. Vernonia hystricosa is often found in open woods, thickets, and along roadsides, thriving in partial to full sun."
