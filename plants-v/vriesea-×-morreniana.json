    "intro": "Vriesea \u00d7 morreniana, commonly known as the hybrid Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange, often with a contrasting green or yellow center. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea \u00d7 morreniana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
