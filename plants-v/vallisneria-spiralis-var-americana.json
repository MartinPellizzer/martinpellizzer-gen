    "intro": "Vallisneria spiralis var. americana, commonly known as American watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in dense clusters near the water surface. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in some regions."
