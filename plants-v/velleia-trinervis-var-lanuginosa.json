    "intro": "Velleia trinervis var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly velleia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a trifoliate or three-lobed structure. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
