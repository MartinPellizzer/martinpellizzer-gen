    "intro": "Vernonia attenuata, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Vernonia attenuata is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
