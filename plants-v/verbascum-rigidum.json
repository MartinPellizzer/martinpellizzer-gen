    "intro": "Verbascum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical shape at the top of the stem. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Verbascum rigidum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
