    "intro": "Vitis saccharifera, commonly known as the sugar grape vine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like China, India, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to grow along supports. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy green surface. The berries, which are small and often yellow or red in color, contain high concentrations of sugars, making the plant valuable for both traditional and commercial uses."
