    "intro": "Vernonia benguellensis, commonly known as the Benguella Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in shrubland and grassland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
