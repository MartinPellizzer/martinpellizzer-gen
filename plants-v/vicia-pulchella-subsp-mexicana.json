It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. It has adapted to arid environments and is capable of fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
