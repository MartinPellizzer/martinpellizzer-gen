    "intro": "Viburnum subsessile, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet, featuring slender, upright stems and small, ovate leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Viburnum subsessile is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage changes to vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
