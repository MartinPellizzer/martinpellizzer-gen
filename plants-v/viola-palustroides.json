It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and swampy areas. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with yellow centers. It is part of the Violaceae family and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered an indicator species for wetland health."
