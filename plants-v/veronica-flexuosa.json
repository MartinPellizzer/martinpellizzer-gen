    "intro": "Veronica flexuosa, commonly known as the bentweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems that can form dense mats, making it well adapted to rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Veronica flexuosa is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
