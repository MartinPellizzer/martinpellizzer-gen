    "intro": "Vernonia denticulata, commonly known as the toothed ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped with finely toothed margins, and its flowers are purple to blue in color, appearing in late summer to early fall. Vernonia denticulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
