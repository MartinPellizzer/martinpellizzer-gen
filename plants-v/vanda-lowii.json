It is characterized by its long, pendant stems and large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air and rain. Vanda lowii thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers can bloom multiple times a year, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
