    "intro": "Viola occulta f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy violet, is a botanical variant of the common violet, characterized by its dense, soft pubescence covering its stems and leaves. This form exhibits a compact growth habit with heart-shaped foliage that is often covered in fine, white to grayish hairs. The flowers are typically violet-blue in color, with five petals and a distinctive spur at the base of the bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
