It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in the late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.
