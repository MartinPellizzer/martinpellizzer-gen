    "intro": "Vicia lathyroides proles olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense vetch, is a rare leguminous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands or along stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ecological role in nitrogen fixation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
