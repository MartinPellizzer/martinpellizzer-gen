    "intro": "Veitchia metiti, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, slow-growing plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its massive, fern-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 6 meters. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is listed as endangered and is protected in its native habitat."
