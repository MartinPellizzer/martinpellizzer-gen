    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus subsp. neglectum, commonly known as common mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, gray-green, velvety leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, fuzzy spikes. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
