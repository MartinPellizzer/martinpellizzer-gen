It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers have five petals and are often adorned with distinctive markings. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
