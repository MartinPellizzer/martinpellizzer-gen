    "intro": "Vitellaria gigantea, commonly known as the shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and compound leaves that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds are the primary source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and cooking. Vitellaria gigantea plays a crucial role in local ecosystems and has significant economic importance for communities in the region."
