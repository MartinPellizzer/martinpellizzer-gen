It features heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its value in native plant gardens."
