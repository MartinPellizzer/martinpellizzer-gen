    "intro": "Vernonia fastigiata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia fastigiata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
