    "intro": "Viola achyrophora, commonly known as the rock viol, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Viola achyrophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
