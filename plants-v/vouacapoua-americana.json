    "intro": "Vouacapoua americana, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is also listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments."
