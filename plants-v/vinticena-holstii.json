    "intro": "Vinticena holstii, commonly known as the Holst's vinticena, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vinticena holstii is considered a species of conservation concern."
