    "intro": "Valeriana decussata, commonly known as the cross-leaved valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly medicinal scent and its distinctive, cross-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Valeriana decussata is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine for its calming properties."
