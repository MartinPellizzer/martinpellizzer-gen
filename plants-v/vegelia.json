    "intro": "Vegelia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Vegelia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
