    "intro": "Verbascum barthii, commonly known as the Ethiopian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are broad and velvety, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Verbascum barthii is also valued for its medicinal properties, used traditionally to treat respiratory ailments."
