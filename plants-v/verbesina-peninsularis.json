    "intro": "Verbesina peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbesina peninsularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
