    "intro": "Vaccinium ciliatum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, acidic soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are elliptical with finely toothed margins, and the plant is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness. Vaccinium ciliatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
