It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom from late summer into early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.
