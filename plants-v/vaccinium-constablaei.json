    "intro": "Vaccinium constablaei, commonly known as the Ceylon heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other heath and cranberry plants. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to blueberries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
