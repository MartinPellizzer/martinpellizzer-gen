    "intro": "Valeriana puberulenta, commonly known as the hairy valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its sedative properties. Valeriana puberulenta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
