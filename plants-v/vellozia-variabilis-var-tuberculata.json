This plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive tuberculate (knob-like) structures on its leaves. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
