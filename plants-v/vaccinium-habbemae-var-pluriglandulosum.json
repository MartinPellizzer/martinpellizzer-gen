    "intro": "Vaccinium habbemae var. pluriglandulosum, commonly known as the hairy whorled blueberry, is a variant of the Vaccinium genus, which includes various species of blueberries and cranberries. It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in culinary applications. This variety is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and potential for hybridization with other Vaccinium species."
