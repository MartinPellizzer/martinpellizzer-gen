    "intro": "Veronica lesbiaca, commonly known as the Lesbia speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit with basal leaves and spikes of blue or violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils. Its flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
