    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. milleria, commonly known as the Millea grape, is a lesser-known variety within the Vitis vinifera species. It is characterized by its small, dark blue to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant is a deciduous vine that thrives in temperate climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. It is often used in specialty wine production due to its unique flavor profile and aromatic qualities. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to more traditional grape varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot."
