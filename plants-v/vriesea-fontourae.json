    "intro": "Vriesea fontourae, commonly known as the Fontoura's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-blue hue. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant orange and red bracts that remain showy for an extended period. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea fontourae is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
