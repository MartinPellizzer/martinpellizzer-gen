    "intro": "Vigna oblonga, commonly known as the horsegram or tuareg bean, is a leguminous plant native to Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its small, elongated pods that contain edible seeds used in various cuisines. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it produces a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Vigna oblonga is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable crop in drought-prone regions."
