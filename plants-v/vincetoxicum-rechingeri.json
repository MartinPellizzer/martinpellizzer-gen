    "intro": "Vincetoxicum rechingeri, commonly known as the Tibetan snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and milky sap-producing plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
