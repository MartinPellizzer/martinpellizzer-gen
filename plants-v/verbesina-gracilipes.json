    "intro": "Verbesina gracilipes, commonly known as slenderleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in wetlands. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and they bloom from late summer into early fall. The plant is notable for its prickly, bract-like structures that can adhere to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal."
