    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia subsp. lucorum, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and arranged in opposing pairs along the stems. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
