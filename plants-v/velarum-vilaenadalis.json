    "intro": "Velarum vilaenadalis, commonly known as the shadowbloom vine, is a rare and elusive plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. Its leaves are broad and velvety, with a deep indigo hue that shimmers under moonlight. The plant produces delicate, bioluminescent flowers that only open at night, emitting a soft blue glow. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires a specific symbiotic relationship with a particular species of fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical research."
