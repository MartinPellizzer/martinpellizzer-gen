    "intro": "Vulpia octoflora f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy vulpia, is a variant of the common vulpia species. It is a low-growing grass that typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. This subspecies is notable for its dense, hairy appearance, which distinguishes it from other forms of Vulpia."
