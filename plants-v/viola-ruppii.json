    "intro": "Viola ruppii, commonly known as the rock violet, is a flowering plant native to rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, adapting to poor soil conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to alpine and woodland environments. Viola ruppii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings."
