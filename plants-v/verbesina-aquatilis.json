    "intro": "Verbesina aquatilis, commonly known as water beggarticks, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems that often grow in water or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with short hairs. Verbesina aquatilis is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in moist, aquatic conditions."
