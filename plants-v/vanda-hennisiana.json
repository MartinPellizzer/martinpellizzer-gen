    "intro": "Vanda hennisiana, commonly known as the Hennis' vanda, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters of 3 to 5, featuring vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with broad, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vanda hennisiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
