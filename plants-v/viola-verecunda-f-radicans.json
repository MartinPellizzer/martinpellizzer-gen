    "intro": "Viola verecunda f. radicans, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It produces small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive yellow center, blooming in early spring. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or garden beds. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens."
