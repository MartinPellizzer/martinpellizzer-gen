    "intro": "Viguiera simsioides, commonly known as Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a strong, aromatic scent. Viguiera simsioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
