    "intro": "Vaccinium stamineum var. affine, commonly known as the small blue huckleberry, is a variant of the blue huckleberry native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly waxy texture, and the plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
