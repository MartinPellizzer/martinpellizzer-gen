    "intro": "Vicia sessei, commonly known as the narrowleaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia sessei is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can often be found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
