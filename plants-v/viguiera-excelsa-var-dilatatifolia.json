    "intro": "Viguiera excelsa var. dilatatifolia, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 3 meters tall, covered in dense, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces showy, purple to pink composite flower heads in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
