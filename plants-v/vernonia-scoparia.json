    "intro": "Vernonia scoparia, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Vernonia scoparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
