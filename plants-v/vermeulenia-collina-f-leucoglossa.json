    "intro": "Vermeulenia collina f. leucoglossa, commonly known as the white-lipped bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
