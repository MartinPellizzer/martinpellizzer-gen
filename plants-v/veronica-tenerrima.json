    "intro": "Veronica tenerrima, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes, blooming throughout the year. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
