It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant has floating leaves with a waxy surface that help it remain buoyant on water. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant is also culturally significant in many societies, symbolizing purity and spiritual awakening."
