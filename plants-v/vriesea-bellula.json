    "intro": "Vriesea bellula, commonly known as the miniature vriesea, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its roots. The plant produces striking, short-lived inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea bellula is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
