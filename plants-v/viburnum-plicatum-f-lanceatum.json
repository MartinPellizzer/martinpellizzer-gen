    "intro": "Viburnum plicatum f. lanceatum, commonly known as the laceleaf viburnum, is a compact, multi-stemmed shrub characterized by its finely cut, lace-like foliage. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a prominent central vein and a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries in the fall. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in partial shade to full sun, preferring well-drained, acidic soil. It is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
