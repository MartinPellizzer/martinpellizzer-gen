    "intro": "Verbena subincana, commonly known as the hairy verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in summer. Verbena subincana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and drought tolerance."
