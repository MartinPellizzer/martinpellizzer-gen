    "intro": "Viola verecunda var. fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves with a fibrous texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy violet flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep blue, typically blooming in early spring. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
