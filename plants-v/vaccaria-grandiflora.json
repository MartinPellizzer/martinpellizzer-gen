    "intro": "Vaccaria grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to conserve water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Vaccaria grandiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
