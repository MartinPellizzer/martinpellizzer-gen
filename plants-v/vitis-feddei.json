    "intro": "Vitis feddei, commonly known as the Fedde's grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its climbing vines, trifoliate leaves, and small, clustered flowers that develop into berries. Vitis feddei is typically grown for its ornamental value and has limited use in viticulture due to its small size and less robust growth compared to other grape species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
