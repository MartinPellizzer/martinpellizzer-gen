    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 semilanatum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattifolium. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that resemble those of the common mullein. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas across its range."
