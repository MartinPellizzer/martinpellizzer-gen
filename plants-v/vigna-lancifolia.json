    "intro": "Vigna lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds. Vigna lancifolia is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
