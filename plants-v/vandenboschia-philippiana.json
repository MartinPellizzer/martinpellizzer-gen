It is characterized by its branching structure, with multiple stems forming a candelabra-like shape. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
