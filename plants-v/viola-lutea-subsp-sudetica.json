It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces yellow flowers with a distinctive violet throat. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
