    "intro": "Vicia onobrychioides subsp. alborosea, commonly known as white vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-improving properties."
