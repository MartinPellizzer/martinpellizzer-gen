    "intro": "Vitex camporum, commonly known as the Campora vitex, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple, blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Vitex camporum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
