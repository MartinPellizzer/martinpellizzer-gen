    "intro": "Viola reptans, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of violet, blue, or white, often with a yellow center. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and garden borders. Viola reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats."
