    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. nigra, commonly known as black vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range from purple to black in color. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Black vetch is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a cover crop."
