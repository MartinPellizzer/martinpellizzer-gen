    "intro": "Verbena demareei, commonly known as the coastal verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of purple, blue, or pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a grayish-green hue, and the flowers bloom throughout the growing season. Verbena demareei is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
