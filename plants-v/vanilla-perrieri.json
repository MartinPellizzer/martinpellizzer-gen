    "intro": "Vanilla perrieri, commonly known as the Perrieri vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by small, dark brown pods. The plant is valued for its unique vanilla-like aroma, though it is less commonly used in commercial vanilla production compared to Vanilla planifolia. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and heart-shaped leaves. The species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and aromatic qualities."
