It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in dense clusters. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to attract pollinators."
