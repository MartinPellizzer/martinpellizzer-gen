    "intro": "Vachellia hebeclada subsp. tristis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, clustered leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical heads, which are followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
