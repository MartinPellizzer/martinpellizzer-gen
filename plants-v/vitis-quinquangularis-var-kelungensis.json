    "intro": "Vitis quinquangularis var. kelungensis, commonly known as the Kelung grape, is a lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its distinctive five-angled stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically red or black in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting habit. However, it is not widely used for commercial wine production compared to other Vitis species."
