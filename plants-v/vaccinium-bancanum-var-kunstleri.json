    "intro": "Vaccinium bancanum var. kunstleri, commonly known as the Kunstler's blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. These berries are not only appreciated for their flavor but also for their high nutritional value. The plant is well adapted to acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments within its native habitat."
