It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea magna is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings."
