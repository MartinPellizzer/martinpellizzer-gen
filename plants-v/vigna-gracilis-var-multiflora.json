    "intro": "Vigna gracilis var. multiflora, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, narrow pods that contain several small, edible seeds. It is adapted to warm climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is often used as a green manure or intercropped with other crops."
