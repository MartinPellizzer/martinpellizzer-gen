    "intro": "Vitis \u00d7 ruggerii, commonly known as the ruggeri grape, is a hybrid vine species resulting from the cross between Vitis vinifera and Vitis riparia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it suitable for both ornamental and agricultural purposes. The plant produces small, often sour-tasting berries that are not typically consumed by humans but are used in some local traditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a coarsely serrated margin, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Vitis \u00d7 ruggerii is also valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at developing disease-resistant grape varieties."
