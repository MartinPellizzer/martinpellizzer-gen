    "intro": "Viola stagnina var. lacteoides, commonly known as the milky violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas of Europe. It produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which is released when the stems or leaves are broken. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or damp meadows. This variety is closely related to other viola species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
