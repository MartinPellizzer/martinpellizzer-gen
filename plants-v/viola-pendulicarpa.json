    "intro": "Viola pendulicarpa, commonly known as the hanging violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Viola pendulicarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
