    "intro": "Verbascum lydium var. heterandrum, commonly known as the Lydian mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that bear large, fuzzy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in soft, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure, with two different types of flowers on the same plant."
