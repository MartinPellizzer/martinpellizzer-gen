This subspecies is characterized by its reduced hair coverage, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in such regions."
