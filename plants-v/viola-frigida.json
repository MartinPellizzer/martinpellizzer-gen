    "intro": "Viola frigida, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet or blue-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Viola frigida is adapted to harsh climates, with a short growing season and a deep root system to withstand cold temperatures. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species within its native habitat."
