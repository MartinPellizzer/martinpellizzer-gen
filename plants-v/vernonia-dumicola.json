    "intro": "Vernonia dumicola, commonly known as the rock vernonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Vernonia dumicola is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
