    "intro": "Vochysia tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leafed acanthus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, often followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
