    "intro": "Vitex pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered panicles of blue to purple flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Vitex pubescens is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
