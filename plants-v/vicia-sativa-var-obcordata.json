    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. obcordata, commonly known as the heartleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with the central leaflet being heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
