    "intro": "Viola alba f. incurva, commonly known as the white violet or nodding violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers that droop downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
