    "intro": "Vitis eriopoda, commonly known as the desert grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody vines, small leaves, and clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its fruits are small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Vitis eriopoda is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh desert climates."
