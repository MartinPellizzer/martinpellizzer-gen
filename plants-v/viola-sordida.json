    "intro": "Viola sordida, commonly known as the dirty violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, pale violet or white flowers. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, damp conditions. Viola sordida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable habitats."
