It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite pairs of oval, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
