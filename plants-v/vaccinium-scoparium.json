    "intro": "Vaccinium scoparium, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and the plant is adapted to grow in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Vaccinium scoparium is often found in woodland edges, heathlands, and rocky areas."
