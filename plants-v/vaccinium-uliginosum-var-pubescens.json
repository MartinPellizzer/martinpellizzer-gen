    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum var. pubescens, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a variant of the common bilberry found in wet, acidic environments. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries. These berries are edible and are often used in jams and culinary applications. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to peat bogs and other moist, nutrient-poor habitats."
