    "intro": "Veronica fruticans subsp. fruticans, commonly known as the creeping veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
