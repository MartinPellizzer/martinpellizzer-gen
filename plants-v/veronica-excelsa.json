    "intro": "Veronica excelsa, commonly known as the tall speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
