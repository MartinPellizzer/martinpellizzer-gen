    "intro": "Vilfa capillaris, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its scientific name. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Vilfa capillaris is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
