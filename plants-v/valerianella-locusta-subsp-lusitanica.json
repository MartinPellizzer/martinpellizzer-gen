    "intro": "Valerianella locusta subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the lusitanian valerian, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually alternate, with a slightly toothed margin. It is closely related to other members of the Valerianaceae family, sharing similar aromatic properties. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
