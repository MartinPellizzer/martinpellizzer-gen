It is native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces clusters of delicate, violet-blue flowers with yellow centers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
