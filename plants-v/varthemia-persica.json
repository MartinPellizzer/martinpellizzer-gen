    "intro": "Varthemia persica, commonly known as Persian sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Varthemia persica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
