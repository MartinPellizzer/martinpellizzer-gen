It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly waxy. The plant produces bright red, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the characteristic red, tart berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in peatlands and wet meadows. This subspecies is an important component of wetland ecosystems and is widely cultivated for its berries."
