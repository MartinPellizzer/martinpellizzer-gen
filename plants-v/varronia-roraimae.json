    "intro": "Varronia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima varronia, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Varronia roraimae is adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor soils of the highland regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
