    "intro": "Vanilla decaryana, commonly known as the red vanilla orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and green flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant produces fragrant vanilla-like pods, though they are not as commercially valuable as those of Vanilla planifolia. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and partial shade. The botanical features of Vanilla decaryana make it a unique and visually appealing addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
