    "intro": "Verbascum sinuatum var. arnaizii, commonly known as the Alboraya mullein, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, gray-green, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
