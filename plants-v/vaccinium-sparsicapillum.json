    "intro": "Vaccinium sparsicapillum, commonly known as the sparse-capped blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them valuable for both wildlife and human consumption. Vaccinium sparsicapillum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats."
