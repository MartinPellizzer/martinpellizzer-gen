    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica f. minuta, commonly known as the lesser water speedwell, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Europe. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, spreading stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in ponds, ditches, and stream edges. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic conditions, with a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in soft, wet substrates."
