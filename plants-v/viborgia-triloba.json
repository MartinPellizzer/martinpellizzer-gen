It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with three prominent lobes on each petal. The plant has a compact growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Viborgia triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, early spring blooms."
