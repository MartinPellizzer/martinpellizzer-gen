    "intro": "Verbascum thapsiforme var. bicolle, commonly known as the two-colored mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive bicoloration, with the lower part of the flower having a darker hue than the upper part."
