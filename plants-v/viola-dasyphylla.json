    "intro": "Viola dasyphylla, commonly known as the woolly violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and distinctive violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Viola dasyphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with suitable conditions."
