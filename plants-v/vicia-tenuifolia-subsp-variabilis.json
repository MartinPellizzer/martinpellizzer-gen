    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia subsp. variabilis, commonly known as the variable narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This subspecies is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its adaptability in different environments."
