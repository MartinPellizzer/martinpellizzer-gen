    "intro": "Verbascum armenum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western mullein, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and along roadsides. Its fibrous roots and soft, velvety leaves make it an attractive and hardy plant for xeriscaping."
