    "intro": "Vicia multicaulis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Vicia multicaulis var. latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
