    "intro": "Vaccinium fissiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. The berries, which are typically blue or purple, are edible and contain high levels of antioxidants."
