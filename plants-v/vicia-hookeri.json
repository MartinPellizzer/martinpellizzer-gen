    "intro": "Vicia hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Vicia hookeri is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes and in meadows. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in its native habitat."
