    "intro": "Vicia balansae, commonly known as the Balansae vetch, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain several seeds. Vicia balansae is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
