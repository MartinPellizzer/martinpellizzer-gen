    "intro": "Vicia graminea var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or violet, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive stipule at the base. This variety is characterized by its reduced flowering, with fewer blooms compared to other varieties of Vicia graminea."
