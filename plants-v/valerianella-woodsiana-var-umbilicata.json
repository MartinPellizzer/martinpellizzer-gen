    "intro": "Valerianella woodsiana var. umbilicata, commonly known as the umbilicated valerian, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers clustered in umbels, which are characteristic of the Valerianaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
