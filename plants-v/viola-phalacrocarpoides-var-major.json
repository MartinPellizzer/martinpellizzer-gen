    "intro": "Viola phalacrocarpoides var. major, commonly known as the giant marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically violet to purple in color, with five petals. The plant produces elongated, slender seed pods that remain attached to the plant for an extended period. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its larger size compared to other viola species, making it a notable presence in its wetland ecosystem."
