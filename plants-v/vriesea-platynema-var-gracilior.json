    "intro": "Vriesea platynema var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender-leafed vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette, with a central inflorescence that produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings. Its ability to store water in its leaf rosette makes it drought-tolerant once established."
