    "intro": "Verbascum lychnitis var. foliosum, commonly known as the leafy mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is closely related to other mullein species and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical medicinal uses."
