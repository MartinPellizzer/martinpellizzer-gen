    "intro": "Viguiera radula, commonly known as the hairy false goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens. Viguiera radula plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
