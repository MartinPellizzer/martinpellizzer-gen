    "intro": "Vitis laevigata, commonly known as the smooth grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Vitis laevigata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it climbs trees or shrubs using its tendrils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
