    "intro": "Viola arvensis subsp. trimestris, commonly known as the three-leaved violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with a deep green color. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, usually between March and May. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
