    "intro": "Vitekorchis callistum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, often in the shade of the forest canopy. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
