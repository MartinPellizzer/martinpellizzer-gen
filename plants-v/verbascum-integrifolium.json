    "intro": "Verbascum integrifolium, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft grayish-white hairs. The leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a tall, upright spike. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
