    "intro": "Vincetoxicum spirale, commonly known as spiral bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spirally arranged leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Vincetoxicum spirale is a perennial vine that can spread aggressively through its rhizomes."
