    "intro": "Vicia biflora subsp. calcarata, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, hairy leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its root system forms nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
