    "intro": "Vincetoxicum micranthum, commonly known as small-flowered thornapple, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with toxic properties. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along woodland edges."
