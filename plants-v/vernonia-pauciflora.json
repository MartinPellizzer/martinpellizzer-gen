    "intro": "Vernonia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer. Vernonia pauciflora is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
