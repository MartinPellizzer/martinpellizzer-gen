    "intro": "Viburnum stellulatum, commonly known as the star viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Viburnum stellulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
