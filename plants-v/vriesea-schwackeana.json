    "intro": "Vriesea schwackeana, commonly known as the Schwaake's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect water. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with showy, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea schwackeana is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
