    "intro": "Vernonia oblonga, commonly known as blackfoot vernonia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia oblonga is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
