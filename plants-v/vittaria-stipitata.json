    "intro": "Vittaria stipitata, commonly known as the button fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, clustered fronds that resemble miniature ferns. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Vittaria stipitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
