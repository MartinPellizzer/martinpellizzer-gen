    "intro": "Viscum trachycarpum var. laevibaccatum, commonly known as the smooth-berry mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as oaks and poplars. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a leathery texture, while its small, white or yellowish flowers appear in clusters. The berries are smooth and typically turn red or yellow when mature, facilitating bird dispersal. This plant plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, though it can also weaken its host."
