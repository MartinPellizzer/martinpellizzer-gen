    "intro": "Vanda insignis var. schroederiana, commonly known as the Schr\u00f6der's vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces strikingly colorful, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and violet. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
