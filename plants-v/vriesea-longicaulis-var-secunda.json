    "intro": "Vriesea longicaulis var. secunda, commonly known as the silver torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features a tall, slender stem with dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, giving it a torch-like appearance. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom from the base of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in indoor settings."
