    "intro": "Vaccinium monanthum, commonly known as the single-flower blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it bears edible berries that are similar in taste to highbush blueberries. Vaccinium monanthum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and local wildlife habitats."
