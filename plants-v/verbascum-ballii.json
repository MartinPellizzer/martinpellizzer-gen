It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in California and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Verbascum ballii is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
