    "intro": "Verbena parvula var. gigas, commonly known as the giant verbena, is a strikingly tall and robust flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaped gardens."
