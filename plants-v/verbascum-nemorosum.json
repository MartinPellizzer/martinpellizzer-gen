    "intro": "Verbascum nemorosum, commonly known as the wood mullein, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum nemorosum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
