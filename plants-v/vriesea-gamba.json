    "intro": "Vriesea gamba, commonly known as the Gamba's bromeliad, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, sword-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Vriesea gamba is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
