    "intro": "Vicia hugeri, commonly known as the lesser vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Vicia hugeri is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This characteristic makes it beneficial for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
