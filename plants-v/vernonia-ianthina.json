    "intro": "Vernonia ianthina, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and features narrow, gray-green leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The botanical name reflects its ornamental value and its association with the genus Vernonia, which includes many species with showy inflorescences."
