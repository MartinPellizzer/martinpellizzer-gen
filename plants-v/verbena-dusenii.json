    "intro": "Verbena dusenii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbena dusenii is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
