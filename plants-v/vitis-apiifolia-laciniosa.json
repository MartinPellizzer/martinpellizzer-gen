    "intro": "Vitis apiifolia laciniosa, commonly known as the laceleaf grape, is a climbing vine native to Central America. It is characterized by its finely lobed, almost lace-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The vine is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
