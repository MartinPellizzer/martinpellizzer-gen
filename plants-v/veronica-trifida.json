    "intro": "Veronica trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Veronica trifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
