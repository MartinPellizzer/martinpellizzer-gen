    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum subsp. pedris, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to acidic bogs and heathlands in northern regions. It produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in culinary applications. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, glandular hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor, wet soils and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Its botanical features make it an important component of peatland ecosystems."
