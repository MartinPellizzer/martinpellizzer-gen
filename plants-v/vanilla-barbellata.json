    "intro": "Vanilla barbellata, commonly known as the orchid vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its fragrant, vanilla-scented flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into fleshy, dark purple berries. Its unique aroma is due to the presence of vanillin, a compound also found in vanilla beans. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its distinctive fragrance."
