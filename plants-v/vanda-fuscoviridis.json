    "intro": "Vanda fuscoviridis, commonly known as the dark green vanda, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs and produces clusters of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It blooms with fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that have prominent purple veins. Vanda fuscoviridis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
