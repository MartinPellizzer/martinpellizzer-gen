    "intro": "Vittaria costata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, wiry fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Vittaria costata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
