It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath a spadix, surrounded by a colorful spathe. Vigolina is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It requires moderate watering and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
