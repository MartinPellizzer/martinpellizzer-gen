    "intro": "Valerianella lingulata, commonly known as sourgrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils. Valerianella lingulata is often found in lawns, along paths, and in moist meadows, where it spreads easily through self-seeding."
