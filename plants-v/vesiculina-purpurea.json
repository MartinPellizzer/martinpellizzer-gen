    "intro": "Vesiculina purpurea, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the water surface. Vesiculina purpurea is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
