    "intro": "Vernonia cernua, commonly known as the nodding ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, dark purple to brownish flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Vernonia cernua thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to wet soils in wetlands or along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
