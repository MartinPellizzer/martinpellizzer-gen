    "intro": "Viguiera immarginata, commonly known as Mexican aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the fall, typically in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and grows in a bushy, upright form. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Viguiera immarginata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
