    "intro": "Vulpia subalata, commonly known as the alpine vulpia, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand cold temperatures. Vulpia subalata plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
