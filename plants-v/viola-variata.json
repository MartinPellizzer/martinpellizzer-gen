    "intro": "Viola variata, commonly known as the variable violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purplish hue and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of violet, purple, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it benefits from partial shade. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
