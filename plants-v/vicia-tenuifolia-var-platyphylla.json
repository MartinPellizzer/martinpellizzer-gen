    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are broader than those of the typical Vicia tenuifolia. The flowers are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in clusters, and are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
