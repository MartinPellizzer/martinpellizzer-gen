    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hispidum, commonly known as the hairy false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in gardens. Vincetoxicum hispidum is often found in woodland edges, disturbed soils, and along roadsides."
