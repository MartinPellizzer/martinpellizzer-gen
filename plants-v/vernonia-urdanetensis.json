    "intro": "Vernonia urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urdanet vernonia, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
