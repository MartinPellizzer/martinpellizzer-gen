    "intro": "Veyretia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are adapted for attaching to host trees. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants over time. Veyretia aphylla is often found in humid, shaded environments within forest canopies."
