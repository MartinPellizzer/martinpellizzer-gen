    "intro": "Vriesea psittacina var. rubrobracteata, commonly known as the red-bract Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant features a rosette of sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear small, white flowers, which are less showy than the bracts. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded indoor environments."
