    "intro": "Vicia crocea, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vicia crocea is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including fields and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
