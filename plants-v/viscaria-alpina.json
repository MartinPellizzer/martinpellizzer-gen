It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Viscaria alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
