    "intro": "Veronica maura, commonly known as mouse ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive central gland. Its leaves are oval-shaped, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, often resembling the ears of a mouse. Veronica maura is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
