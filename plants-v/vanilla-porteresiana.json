    "intro": "Vanilla porteresiana, commonly known as the orchid vanilla, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. This plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated for commercial vanilla production, unlike its more famous relative, Vanilla planifolia."
