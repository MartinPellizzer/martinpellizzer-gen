    "intro": "Vesicaria schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's bladder fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like spore cases that are clustered in groups on the underside of its fronds. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
