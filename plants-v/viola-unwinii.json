    "intro": "Viola unwinii, commonly known as the Unwin's violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with five petals arranged in a distinctive pattern. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, which helps to retain moisture. Viola unwinii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
