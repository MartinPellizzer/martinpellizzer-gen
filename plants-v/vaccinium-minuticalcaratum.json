    "intro": "Vaccinium minuticalcaratum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue or black when mature, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full to partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
