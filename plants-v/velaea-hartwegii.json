    "intro": "Velaea hartwegii, commonly known as the silver velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
