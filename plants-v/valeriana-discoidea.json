    "intro": "Valeriana discoidea, commonly known as the disc-like valerian, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, disc-like inflorescence. Its flowers are usually borne on long, slender stems and bloom during the cooler months. Valeriana discoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
