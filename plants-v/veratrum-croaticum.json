It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, smooth, grass-like stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and form a basal rosette, contributing to its striking appearance.
