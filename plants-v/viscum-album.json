    "intro": "Viscum album, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees such as oak, apple, and pine. It has a distinctive appearance with smooth, glossy evergreen leaves and small, white berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant produces sticky seeds that adhere to tree bark, allowing it to establish new growth. Viscum album is often associated with festive traditions, particularly in Christmas celebrations. Its unique life cycle involves both parasitic and symbiotic relationships with its host trees."
