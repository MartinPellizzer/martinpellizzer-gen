    "intro": "Vitis cordifolia var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinct white or pale green spots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of small, edible berries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks. The varietal name \"punctata\" refers to the speckled appearance of its leaves, which is a distinguishing feature of this plant."
