    "intro": "Valeriana columbaria, commonly known as the columbaria valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Valeriana columbaria is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other valerian species."
