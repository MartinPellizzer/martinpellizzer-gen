    "intro": "Viburnum arboricola, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clustered panicles during late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dark blue to black drupe, which is edible but not widely consumed by humans. Viburnum arboricola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
