    "intro": "Veronica catenata subsp. pseudocatenata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in moist, grassy habitats. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks."
