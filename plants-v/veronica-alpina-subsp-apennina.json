    "intro": "Veronica alpina subsp. apennina, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers clustered in whorls along the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
