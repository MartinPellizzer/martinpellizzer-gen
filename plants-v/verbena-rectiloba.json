    "intro": "Verbena rectiloba, commonly known as the straight-stemmed verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it is known for its long blooming period from spring to fall. Verbena rectiloba is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
