    "intro": "Vismia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazil beautyberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, fragrant, violet-blue berries that appear in clusters. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptic leaves with a glossy surface and prominent veins. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. The berries are edible for humans and animals, though they are often consumed in moderation due to their high acidity."
