    "intro": "Vitis ursina, commonly known as bearberry vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its tendrils that help it climb towards sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture. Vitis ursina is often found in woodland areas and is known for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
