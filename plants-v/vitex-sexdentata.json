    "intro": "Vitex sexdentata, commonly known as the chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue or purple flowers in the summer, which are followed by narrow, woody fruits containing small, black seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Vitex sexdentata is also valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun."
