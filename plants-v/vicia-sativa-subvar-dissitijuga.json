    "intro": "Vicia sativa subvar. dissitijuga, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its seeds are also edible and have been used in traditional cuisines."
