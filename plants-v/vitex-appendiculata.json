    "intro": "Vitex appendiculata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
