    "intro": "Viscum griseum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves both a seed stage and a vegetative stage, with the latter relying heavily on the host tree for survival. Viscum griseum is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in forested areas."
