    "intro": "Veronica glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in tiny glands, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Veronica glandulosa is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
