It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet and produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Vernonia primulina is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
