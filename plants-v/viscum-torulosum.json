    "intro": "Viscum torulosum, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white or pale green berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host tree's bark. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in woodland and forested areas. Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on its host species."
