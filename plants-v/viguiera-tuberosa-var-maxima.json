    "intro": "Viguiera tuberosa var. maxima, commonly known as the Mexican heather or Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, tuberous roots that store nutrients, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a grayish-green hue, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
