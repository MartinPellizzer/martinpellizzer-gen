    "intro": "Vicia pumila, commonly known as the small vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces slender, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry grasslands. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Vicia pumila is typically used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties."
