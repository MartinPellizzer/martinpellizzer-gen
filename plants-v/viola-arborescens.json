    "intro": "Viola arborescens, commonly known as the tree violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems that resemble small trees, hence its common name. The plant produces heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a hairy texture, and clusters of violet or purple flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
