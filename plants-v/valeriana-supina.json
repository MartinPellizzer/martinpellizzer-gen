    "intro": "Valeriana supina, commonly known as the prostrate valerian, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Valeriana supina is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
