    "intro": "Viscum katikianum, commonly known as the Armenian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through its stems. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
