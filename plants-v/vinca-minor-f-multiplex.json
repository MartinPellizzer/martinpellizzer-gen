    "intro": "Vinca minor f. multiplex, commonly known as the spreading greater periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and is commonly used in ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to suppress weeds. This variety is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
