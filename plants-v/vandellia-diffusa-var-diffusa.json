    "intro": "Vandellia diffusa var. diffusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
