    "intro": "Vaccinium hispidulum, commonly known as the rough blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Vaccinium hispidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
