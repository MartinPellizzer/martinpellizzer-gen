    "intro": "Vulpia murorum, commonly known as mouse-ear grass, is a small annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and prefers dry, sandy or gravelly habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Vulpia murorum is adapted to thrive in harsh environments, making it a resilient and widespread plant in its native range."
