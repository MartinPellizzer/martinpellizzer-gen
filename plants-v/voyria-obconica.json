    "intro": "Voyria obconica, commonly known as the narrow-ovate voyria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, often in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
