    "intro": "Vicia venosa subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. This subspecies is known for its stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively along the ground. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in ruderal habitats. The plant has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
