    "intro": "Vulpia alpina, commonly known as alpine vulpia, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous annual grass that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Vulpia alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous areas across Europe, Asia, and North America."
