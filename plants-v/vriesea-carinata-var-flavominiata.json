    "intro": "Vriesea carinata var. flavominiata, commonly known as the golden stripe Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that are often marked with yellow or orange stripes. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
