    "intro": "Vittaria doniana var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rock fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
