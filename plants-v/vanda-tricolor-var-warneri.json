    "intro": "Vanda tricolor var. warneri, commonly known as the Warner's Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, three-colored flowers that typically feature combinations of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The species is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
