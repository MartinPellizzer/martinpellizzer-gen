    "intro": "Vaccinium decumbens, commonly known as creeping blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other species in the Vacciniaceae family. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and pine forests. Its leaves are elliptical with a slightly waxy texture, and the plant is known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. The berries are not only valued for their flavor but also for their nutritional content, containing antioxidants and vitamins."
