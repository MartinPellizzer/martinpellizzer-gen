    "intro": "Vernonia sericea, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, dark blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a fibrous root system and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
