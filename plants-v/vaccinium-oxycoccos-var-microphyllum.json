    "intro": "Vaccinium oxycoccos var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, dark red berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in acidic, peaty soils and is typically found in wetland or bog environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it has a dense, mat-like growth habit. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical cranberry species."
