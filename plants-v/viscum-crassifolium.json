    "intro": "Viscum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its sticky seeds. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host via its stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are toxic to many animals. It is native to parts of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. Its presence can weaken host trees over time, making it both ecologically significant and potentially damaging."
