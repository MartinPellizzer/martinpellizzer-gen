It is native to the northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, typically growing in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant is often found in boreal and temperate forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments."
