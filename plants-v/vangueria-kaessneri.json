    "intro": "Vangueria kaessneri, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are yellow when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions as a decorative plant."
