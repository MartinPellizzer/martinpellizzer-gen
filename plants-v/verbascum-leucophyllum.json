It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, silvery-green leaves that reflect light, helping to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
