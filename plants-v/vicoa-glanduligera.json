It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
