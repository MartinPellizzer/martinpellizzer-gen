    "intro": "Veronica farinosa, commonly known as the dusty miller, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost dusty appearance. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Veronica farinosa is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
