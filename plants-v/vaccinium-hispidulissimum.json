It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces edible berries that are often used in local cuisine. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
