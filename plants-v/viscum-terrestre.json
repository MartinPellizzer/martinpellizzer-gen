    "intro": "Viscum terrestre, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that contain toxic seeds. Viscum terrestre is often found in temperate regions and is associated with various host species, including oak and apple trees. Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and contributing to the natural cycle of forest ecosystems."
