    "intro": "Vismia frondosa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often reddish-barked trunk. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture. Vismia frondosa is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments."
