It features heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy violet flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
