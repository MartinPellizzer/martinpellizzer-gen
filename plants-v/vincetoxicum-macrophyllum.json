    "intro": "Vincetoxicum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
