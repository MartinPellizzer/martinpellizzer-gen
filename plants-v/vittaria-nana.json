    "intro": "Vittaria nana, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for moisture and nutrients rather than soil. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria nana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
