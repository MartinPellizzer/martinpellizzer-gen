    "intro": "Vallesia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous vallesia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Vallesia dichotoma is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
