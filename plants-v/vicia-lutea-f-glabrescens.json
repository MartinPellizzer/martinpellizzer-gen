    "intro": "Vicia lutea f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous yellow vetch, is a variant of the yellow vetch, characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves. This plant is a legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. The glabrous form distinguishes it from other variants by its lack of pubescence, making it visually distinct. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in agricultural and ecological contexts."
