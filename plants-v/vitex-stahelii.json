    "intro": "Vitex stahelii, commonly known as the Staheli's chaste tree, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Vitex stahelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
