    "intro": "Viola inconspicua subsp. dielsiana, commonly known as the Diels' violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet or purple. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals, and are often borne on short stalks. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific floral characteristics that set it apart from other viola species."
