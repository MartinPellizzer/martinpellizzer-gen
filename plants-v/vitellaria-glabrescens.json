    "intro": "Vitellaria glabrescens, commonly known as shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a fatty seed known as shea butter. The shea tree is valued for its economic importance, particularly for the production of shea butter used in cosmetics and food. It also plays a significant role in local ecosystems and traditional practices across its native range."
