It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers with a distinctive purplish or reddish tinge on the lower petals. The leaves are heart-shaped and often covered with a fine, velvety texture. This variant is a natural form of Viola albida, distinguished by its rugose (wrinkled) leaf surface. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas across its native range."
