    "intro": "Valerianella eriocarpa var. intermedia, commonly known as mouse whiskers, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright green, ovate leaves that are often covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in salads or as a garnish due to its mild, peppery flavor."
