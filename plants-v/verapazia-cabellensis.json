    "intro": "Verapazia cabellensis, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of central Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinct lip. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Verapazia cabellensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
