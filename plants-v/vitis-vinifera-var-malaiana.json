    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. malaiana, commonly known as the Malian grape, is a lesser-known variety of grape native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are typically used for making local wines. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a moderate amount of sunlight. It has a robust vine structure and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a rare and underappreciated botanical specimen."
