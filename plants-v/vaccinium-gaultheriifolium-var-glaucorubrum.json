    "intro": "Vaccinium gaultheriifolium var. glaucorubrum, commonly known as the red-flowered cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, giving them a bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, which bloom in early summer. These flowers give way to bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and often consumed by both humans and wildlife. The species is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
