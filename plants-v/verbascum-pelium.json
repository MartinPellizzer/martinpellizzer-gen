    "intro": "Verbascum pelium, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, grayish-white hairs that give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in a clustered inflorescence at the top of the stem. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. Verbascum pelium is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its historical use in traditional medicine."
