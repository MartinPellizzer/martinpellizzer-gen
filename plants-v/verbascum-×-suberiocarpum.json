    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 suberiocarpum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum suberifolium. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in a terminal spike, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in Mediterranean climates. Due to its hybrid nature, it may exhibit a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species."
