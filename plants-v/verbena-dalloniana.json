    "intro": "Verbena dalloniana, commonly known as the Hawaiian verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of blue, violet, or purple. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in coastal areas and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
