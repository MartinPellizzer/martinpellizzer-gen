    "intro": "Vaccinium atrococcum f. leucococcum, commonly known as the white highbush blueberry, is a botanical variant of the highbush blueberry. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers, which contrast with the typical blue-purple hues of the species. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to regular blueberries but are often less abundant. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in local agriculture."
