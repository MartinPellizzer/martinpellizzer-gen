    "intro": "Vilfa stolonifera var. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed stoloniferous vilfa, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its creeping, stoloniferous growth habit. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for ground cover in humid climates."
