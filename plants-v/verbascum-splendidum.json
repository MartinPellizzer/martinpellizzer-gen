    "intro": "Verbascum splendidum, commonly known as the splendid mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its showy yellow flowers appear in late summer, forming clusters at the top of the plant. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
