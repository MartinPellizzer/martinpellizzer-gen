    "intro": "Vitis rupestris f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected rock grape, is a unique cultivar of the rock grape vine. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost fern-like appearance. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, clusters of greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by small, sweet-tasting berries. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
