    "intro": "Verbascum niveum subsp. pannosiforme, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its common name reflects the soft, woolly texture of its foliage, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh environmental conditions."
