    "intro": "Veronica triphyllos var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common weed in gardens and natural areas."
