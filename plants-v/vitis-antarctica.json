    "intro": "Vitis antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic vine, is a rare plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica. It is one of the few flowering plants that survive in the harsh conditions of the continent, thriving in rocky soil and coastal areas. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces clusters of greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds, with a slow growth rate. Vitis antarctica is of great interest to botanists due to its unique survival strategies in one of the most hostile climates on Earth."
