    "intro": "Vicia incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Vicia incisa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
