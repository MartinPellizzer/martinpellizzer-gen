    "intro": "Viguiera rojasii, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its showy, purple to pink flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera rojasii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
