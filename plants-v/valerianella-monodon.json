    "intro": "Valerianella monodon, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Valerianella monodon is often found in nutrient-rich soils and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
