    "intro": "Viola triloba f. albida, commonly known as the white viola, is a hybrid form of the common violet. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white petals, which distinguish it from the typical purple or violet hues of the species. The plant is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, shady environments, typically found in woodland areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, giving them a soft texture. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its delicate, early spring blooms."
