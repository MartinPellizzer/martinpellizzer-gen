It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
