    "intro": "Vavilovia, commonly known as the Chinese sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hippocastanaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Vavilovia fordii and Vavilovia ferulifolia, which are native to China and the Russian Far East. These plants are shrubs characterized by their thorny stems, compound leaves, and showy yellow flowers. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Vavilovia species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and have been studied for their potential in ecological restoration projects."
