    "intro": "Verbesina angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces tiny, bristly seeds that are dispersed by attachment to animals or clothing. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
