    "intro": "Vernonia subsessilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, dark purple to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces a distinctive, spiky seed head that persists into the winter. Vernonia subsessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
