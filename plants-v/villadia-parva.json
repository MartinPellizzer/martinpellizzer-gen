    "intro": "Villadia parva, commonly known as the dwarf villadia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate nature, it is relatively rare and requires specific care to cultivate successfully."
