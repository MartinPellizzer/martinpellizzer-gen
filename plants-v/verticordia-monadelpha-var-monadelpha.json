It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking, pinkish-red flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are borne on one side of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
