    "intro": "Vicia unijuga, commonly known as the single-flowered vetch, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its trifoliate leaves are simple and oval-shaped, and it produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Vicia unijuga is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
