    "intro": "Viviania calycina, commonly known as the Trinidadian waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The flowers, while small, play a role in attracting pollinators like beetles and flies."
