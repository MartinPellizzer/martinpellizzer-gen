    "intro": "Veronica lobelioides, commonly known as the slender speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features slender stems covered in small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often matted and can form dense ground cover, making it useful for erosion control. Veronica lobelioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
