    "intro": "Viburnum incarum, commonly known as the New Zealand honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to New Zealand. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are an important food source for native birds. Viburnum incarum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in gardens and natural landscapes."
