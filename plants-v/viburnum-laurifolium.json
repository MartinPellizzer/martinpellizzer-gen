It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, giving it a lush appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Viburnum laurifolium is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
