    "intro": "Vicia dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy pod vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and long, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Vicia dasycarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
