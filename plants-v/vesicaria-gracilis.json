    "intro": "Vesicaria gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged. Vesicaria gracilis is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
