It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
