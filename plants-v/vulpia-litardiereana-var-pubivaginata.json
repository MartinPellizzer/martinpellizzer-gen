It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, soft blades that are often covered in short, pubescent hairs. The inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with a distinct midrib that is slightly prominent. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
