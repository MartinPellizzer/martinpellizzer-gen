    "intro": "Valeriana septentrionalis var. uliginosa, commonly known as swamp valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features aromatic, reddish-brown roots and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its calming effects."
