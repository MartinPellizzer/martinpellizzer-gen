    "intro": "Verbena chilensis, commonly known as Chilean verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant is often found in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Verbena chilensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
