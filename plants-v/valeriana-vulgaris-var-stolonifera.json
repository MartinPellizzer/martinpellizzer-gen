    "intro": "Valeriana vulgaris var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that can grow up to 60 cm tall, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a strong, aromatic scent. Valeriana vulgaris var. stolonifera is known for its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments."
