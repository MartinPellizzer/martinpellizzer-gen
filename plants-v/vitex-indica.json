It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often fuzzy or hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are woody, three-lobed berries that contain seeds. Vitex indica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
