    "intro": "Veronica austriaca var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features creeping stems that form a dense mat, often reaching heights of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers clustered in pairs, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
