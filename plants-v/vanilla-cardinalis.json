    "intro": "Vanilla cardinalis, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or the cardinal vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It produces fragrant, vanilla-scented pods that are used in both culinary and aromatic applications. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces striking red flowers that are often pollinated by specific bee species. Its vanilla flavor is milder compared to the more widely known vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a trellis for support as it climbs."
