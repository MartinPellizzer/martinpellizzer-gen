It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest understories. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, violet-colored flowers in early spring. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cool, temperate climates."
