    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 litoralis, commonly known as the coastal violet, is a hybrid species that combines traits from several viola species. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from purple to white, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in salty environments. Viola \u00d7 litoralis is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
