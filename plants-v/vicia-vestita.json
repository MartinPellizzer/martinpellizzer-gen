It is a perennial vine characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.

It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
