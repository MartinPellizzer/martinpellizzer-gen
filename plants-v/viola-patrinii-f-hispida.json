    "intro": "Viola patrinii f. hispida, commonly known as the hispid viola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, short pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces delicate violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
