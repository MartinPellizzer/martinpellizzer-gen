    "intro": "Vernonia decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, sunny environments. Its scientific name reflects its decumbent growth habit, where the stems lie flat on the ground. Vernonia decumbens is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
