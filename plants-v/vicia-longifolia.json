    "intro": "Vicia longifolia, commonly known as the longpod vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, bearing small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Vicia longifolia is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
