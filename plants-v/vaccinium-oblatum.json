    "intro": "Vaccinium oblatum, commonly known as the flat-leaved huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue or black when mature. Its leaves are oval-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, acidic habitats. Vaccinium oblatum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
