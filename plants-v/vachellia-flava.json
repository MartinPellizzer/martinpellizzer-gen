    "intro": "Vachellia flava, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stem and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptability to poor soil conditions. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
