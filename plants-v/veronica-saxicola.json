    "intro": "Veronica saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Veronica saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
