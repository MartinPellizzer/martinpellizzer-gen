    "intro": "Vitex cannabifolia, commonly known as the cannabis bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to purple. The plant is notable for its aromatic foliage and has been used traditionally in various cultural and medicinal practices. Its botanical features make it distinct from other members of the Vitex genus, particularly due to its resemblance to Cannabis sativa in leaf structure."
