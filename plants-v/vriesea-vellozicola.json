    "intro": "Vriesea vellozicola, commonly known as the yellow-bellied vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that ranges in color from yellow to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. Vriesea vellozicola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers humid environments with well-draining soil."
