It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are velvety and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum nicolai is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
