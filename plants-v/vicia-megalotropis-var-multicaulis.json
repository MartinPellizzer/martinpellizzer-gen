    "intro": "Vicia megalotropis var. multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered broad-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with broad, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
