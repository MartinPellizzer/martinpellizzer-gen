    "intro": "Viguiera triplinervis, commonly known as the three-veined goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Viguiera triplinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid environments."
