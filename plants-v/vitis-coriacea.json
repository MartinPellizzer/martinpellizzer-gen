    "intro": "Vitis coriacea, commonly known as the sand grape, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of round, green berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis coriacea is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is a hardy species that can tolerate periodic flooding and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological significance."
