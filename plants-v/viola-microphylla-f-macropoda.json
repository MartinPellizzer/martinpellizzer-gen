    "intro": "Viola microphylla f. macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaved violet, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are notably larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of violet or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
