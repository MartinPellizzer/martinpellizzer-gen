    "intro": "Vicia americana var. americana, commonly known as the American vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
