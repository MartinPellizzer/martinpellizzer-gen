    "intro": "Vaccinium japonicum var. lasiostemon, commonly known as Japanese huckleberry, is a shrub native to Japan and parts of Korea. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features erect, often branched stems. The leaves are elliptical, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, which are typically pink to white in color. Its berries are small, dark purple to black, and are edible, though they are often used in traditional Japanese cuisine and herbal remedies."
