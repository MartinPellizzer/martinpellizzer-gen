    "intro": "Vitex heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf chaste tree, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from ovate to elliptical, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically purple or white, which bloom in the summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Vitex heterophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or semi-shaded areas."
