It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, upright growth. The leaves are leathery and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and clustered in racemes, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
