    "intro": "Valeriana psychrophila, commonly known as the cold-loving valerian, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent, characteristic of the Valeriana genus. Valeriana psychrophila is valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders."
