    "intro": "Vanilla atropogon, commonly known as black vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers and elongated, aromatic pods. The plant produces a unique vanilla-like aroma, though it is not as commercially cultivated as vanilla planifolia. Its botanical features include heart-shaped leaves and a complex floral structure typical of orchids. The fruit, which ripens to a deep black color, is used in traditional medicine and culinary applications in its native regions."
