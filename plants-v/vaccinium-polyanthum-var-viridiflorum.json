    "intro": "Vaccinium polyanthum var. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white to pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and potential for use in native plant landscaping."
