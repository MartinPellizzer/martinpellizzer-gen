    "intro": "Viscum comorense, commonly known as the Comorian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It grows on the branches of native trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, and derives some of its nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and arranged in pairs along the stem. Viscum comorense plays a role in the local ecosystem, providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
