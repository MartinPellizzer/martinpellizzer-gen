    "intro": "Veronica tournefortii subsp. corrensiana, commonly known as the Corsican speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
