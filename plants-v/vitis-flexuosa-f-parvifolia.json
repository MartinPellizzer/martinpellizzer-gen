    "intro": "Vitis flexuosa f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf grapevine, is a compact variant of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and slender, trailing stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible berries, though they are typically less flavorful than those of the main species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and manageable size make it a popular choice for container planting and vertical gardens."
