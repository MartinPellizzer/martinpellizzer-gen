    "intro": "Veronica stachyoides, commonly known as silverleaf speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Veronica stachyoides is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
