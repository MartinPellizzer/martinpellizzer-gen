    "intro": "Vriesea \u00d7 kitteliana, commonly known as the hybrid bromeliad, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Vriesea splendens and Vriesea \u00d7 tricolor. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant is native to Brazil and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its rosette-shaped leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and they collect water in a central cup, a feature common to many bromeliads. Vriesea \u00d7 kitteliana is popular as a ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
