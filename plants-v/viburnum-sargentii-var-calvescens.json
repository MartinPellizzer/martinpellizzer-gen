    "intro": "Viburnum sargentii var. calvescens, commonly known as the Sargent viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which contribute to its ecological and aesthetic appeal."
