    "intro": "Vulpia membranacea subvar. occidentalis, commonly known as western silky bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to western North America. It features fine, blue-green blades with a silky texture, often forming dense mats on dry, disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common pioneer species in arid environments. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
