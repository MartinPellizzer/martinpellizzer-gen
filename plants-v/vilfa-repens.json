    "intro": "Vilfa repens, commonly known as creeping violets, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and clusters of delicate, violet-blue flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Vilfa repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
