    "intro": "Vittaria minor, commonly known as the lesser tooth fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, pinnate fronds. The fronds are typically less than 10 centimeters in length and have a soft, leathery texture. Vittaria minor thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
