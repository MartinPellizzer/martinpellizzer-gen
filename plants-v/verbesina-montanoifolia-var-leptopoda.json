It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces tiny, hooked seeds that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. This species is noted for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
