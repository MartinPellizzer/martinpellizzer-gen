    "intro": "Vateria affinis, commonly known as the white sand pine, is a small evergreen tree native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing its seeds. Vateria affinis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native habitats."
