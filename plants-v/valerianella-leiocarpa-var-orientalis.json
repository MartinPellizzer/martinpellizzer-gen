    "intro": "Valerianella leiocarpa var. orientalis, commonly known as oriental mouse-ear cress, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops."
