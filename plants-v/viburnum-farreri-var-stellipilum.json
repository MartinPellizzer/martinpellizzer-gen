    "intro": "Viburnum farreri var. stellipilum, commonly known as the star-pilose viburnum, is a compact shrub native to China. It features small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and seasonal fruit display."
