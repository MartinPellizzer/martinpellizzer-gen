It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, violet-blue flowers in panicles during the summer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its showy blooms and adaptability to various soil types. The varietal form is prized for its enhanced foliage and floral display compared to the standard Vitex agnus-castus."
