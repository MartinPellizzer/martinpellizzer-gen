    "intro": "Vicia venosa var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which are followed by slender, curved pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
