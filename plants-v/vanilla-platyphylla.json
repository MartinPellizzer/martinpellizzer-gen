    "intro": "Vanilla platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow blossoms that eventually develop into dark brown pods, which are the source of its aromatic properties. Vanilla platyphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its potential use in natural perfumes and flavorings. However, it is less commonly used for commercial vanilla extraction compared to Vanilla planifolia."
