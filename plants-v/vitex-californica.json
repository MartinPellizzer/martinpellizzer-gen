    "intro": "Vitex californica, commonly known as California vitex, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features opposite, pinnately compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, blue-to-purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice in native plant gardens."
