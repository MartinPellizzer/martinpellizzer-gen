It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Veronica calcicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
