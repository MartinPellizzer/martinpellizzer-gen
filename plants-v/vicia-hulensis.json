    "intro": "Vicia hulensis, commonly known as Hulens's vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Vicia hulensis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
