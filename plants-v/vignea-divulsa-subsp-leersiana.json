    "intro": "Vignea divulsa subsp. leersiana, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is often grown as a cover crop or for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility. The subspecies leersiana is distinguished by its smaller size and specific morphological traits compared to other subspecies of Vignea divulsa."
