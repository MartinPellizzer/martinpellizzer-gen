    "intro": "Valeriana spectabilis, commonly known as showy valerian, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Valeriana spectabilis is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is similar to that of valerian root. It serves as a food source for various pollinators and is often found in wetlands and stream banks."
