    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 arenicola, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, velvety, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Verbascum \u00d7 arenicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
