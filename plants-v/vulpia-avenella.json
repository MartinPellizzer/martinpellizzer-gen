    "intro": "Vulpia avenella, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a low-growing annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are finely powdered and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Vulpia avenella is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open areas where it thrives in dry, nutrient-poor conditions."
