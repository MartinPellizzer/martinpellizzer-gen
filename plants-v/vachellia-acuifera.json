    "intro": "Vachellia acuifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots and a high tolerance for heat and drought. Vachellia acuifera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
