    "intro": "Vulpia microstachys var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and narrow, linear leaves with ciliate margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
