It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Virea hispida var. hastilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
