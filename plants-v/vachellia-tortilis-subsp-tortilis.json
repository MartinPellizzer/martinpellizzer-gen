    "intro": "Vachellia tortilis subsp. tortilis, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its dense, branching thorns. The plant has small, compound leaves that are often reduced to spines, and it produces yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments. Its thorns provide shelter for small animals, and its wood is used for fuel and construction in some regions."
