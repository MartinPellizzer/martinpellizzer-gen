    "intro": "Vernonia pellita, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its showy purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Vernonia pellita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
