    "intro": "Vernonanthura deppeana, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a robust, branching stem and hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its capsule-like fruit contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vernonanthura deppeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
