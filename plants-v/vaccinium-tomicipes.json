    "intro": "Vaccinium tomicipes, commonly known as the Tomi Cape blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Japan. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other members of the Vacciniaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in maritime climates with cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and densely packed. The plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential as a fruit crop in suitable climates."
