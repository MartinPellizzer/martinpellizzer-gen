It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, woolly appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or arid environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
