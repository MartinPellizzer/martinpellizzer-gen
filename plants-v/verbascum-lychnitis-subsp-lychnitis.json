    "intro": "Verbascum lychnitis subsp. lychnitis, commonly known as the common mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in the same soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
