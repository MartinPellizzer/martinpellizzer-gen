    "intro": "Vulpia myuros f. megalura, commonly known as the large-leaf vulpia, is a grass species characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often hairy, and its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. It is a short-lived perennial, with flowering occurring in the summer months. The subspecies megalura is distinguished by its larger leaf size compared to the typical form of Vulpia myuros."
