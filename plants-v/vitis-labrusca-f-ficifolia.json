    "intro": "Vitis labrusca f. ficifolia, commonly known as the grapevine fig-leaved grape, is a unique cultivar of the American grapevine. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which resembles that of fig trees, featuring large, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production. This variety thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
