    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia var. nemorum, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful ground cover in garden settings."
