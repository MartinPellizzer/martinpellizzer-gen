    "intro": "Vriesea unilateralis, commonly known as the Spineless Pineapple Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple, which are often more showy than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Its foliage is often variegated with yellow and green patterns, adding to its ornamental appeal. Vriesea unilateralis thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
