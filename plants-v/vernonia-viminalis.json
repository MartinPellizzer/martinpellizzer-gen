    "intro": "Vernonia viminalis, commonly known as slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are blue to purple in color. Vernonia viminalis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
