It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped, hairy leaves. Its showy yellow flowers appear in late summer and are followed by small, dry fruits called achenes.
