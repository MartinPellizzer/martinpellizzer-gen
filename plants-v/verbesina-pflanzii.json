    "intro": "Verbesina pflanzii, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbesina pflanzii is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun."
