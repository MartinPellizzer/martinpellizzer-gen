    "intro": "Vappodes dicupha, commonly known as the two-cup fern, is a unique species within the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that form two cup-like structures, which provide a habitat for small organisms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas. Vappodes dicupha plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
