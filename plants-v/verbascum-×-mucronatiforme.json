    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 mucronatiforme, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattifolium. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are typical of the mullein genus. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
