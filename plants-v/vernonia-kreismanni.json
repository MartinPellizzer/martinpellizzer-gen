    "intro": "Vernonia kreismanni, commonly known as the Blue Mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small blue or purple clouds. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its showy, daisy-like blooms appear in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia kreismanni is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide ecological benefits."
