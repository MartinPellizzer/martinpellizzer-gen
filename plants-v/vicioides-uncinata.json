It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is characterized by its hooked, spirally twisted stems, which aid in its climbing habit. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature. Vicioides uncinata is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates."
