    "intro": "Viburnum glabratum var. sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the dwarf swamp viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and features small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, spherical berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils, contributing to its ecological significance."
