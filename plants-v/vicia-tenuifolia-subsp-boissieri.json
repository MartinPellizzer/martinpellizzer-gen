It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. This subspecies is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in dry, rocky or sandy soils. It produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or through animal activity. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration efforts."
