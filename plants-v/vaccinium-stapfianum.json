    "intro": "Vaccinium stapfianum, commonly known as the Stapf's blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small, dark blue berry, is edible and has a tart flavor, though it is not as widely cultivated as other Vaccinium species. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas."
