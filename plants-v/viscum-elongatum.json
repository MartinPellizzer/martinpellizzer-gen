    "intro": "Viscum elongatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum elongatum has a distinctive appearance with its dense, evergreen foliage and intricate, branching structure. It plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity."
