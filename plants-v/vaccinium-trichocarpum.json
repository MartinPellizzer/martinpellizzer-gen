    "intro": "Vaccinium trichocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that are typically blue-black in color. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. Vaccinium trichocarpum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade."
