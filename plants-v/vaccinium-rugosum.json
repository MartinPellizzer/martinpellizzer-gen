It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible and contain high levels of antioxidants. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. Vaccinium rugosum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments."
