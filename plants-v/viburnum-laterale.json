    "intro": "Viburnum laterale, commonly known as arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Viburnum laterale is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and support local wildlife."
