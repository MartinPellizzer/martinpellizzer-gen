    "intro": "Viburnum fallax, commonly known as the swamp viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is characterized by its clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Viburnum fallax has opposite, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability to saturated soils."
