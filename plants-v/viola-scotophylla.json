    "intro": "Viola scotophylla, commonly known as the moonflower viola, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale violet to white flowers that bloom primarily at night. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Viola scotophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
