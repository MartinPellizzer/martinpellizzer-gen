    "intro": "Vitex oxycuspis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Vitex oxycuspis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
