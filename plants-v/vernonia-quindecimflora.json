It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in woodland edges and prairies. Its showy, yellow-orange flower heads appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental value."
