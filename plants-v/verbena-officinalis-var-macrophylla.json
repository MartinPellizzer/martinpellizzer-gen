    "intro": "Verbena officinalis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved vervain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems covered in opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of the typical verbena species. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their soothing and antispasmodic effects."
