    "intro": "Vitis-idaea punctata var. minor, commonly known as dwarf trailing grapevine, is a low-growing evergreen vine native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, dark green leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is less common than its parent species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
