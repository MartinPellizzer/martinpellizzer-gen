It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like heather and cranberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use as a ground cover or in woodland gardens."
