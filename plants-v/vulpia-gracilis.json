    "intro": "Vulpia gracilis, commonly known as slender vulpia, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Vulpia gracilis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with low moisture and nutrient levels."
