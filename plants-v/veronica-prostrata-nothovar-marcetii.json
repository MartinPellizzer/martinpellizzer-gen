    "intro": "Veronica prostrata nothovar. marcetii, commonly known as the prostrate speedwell, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in marginal garden spaces."
