    "intro": "Vigna luteola, commonly known as the yellow cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods containing edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to poor soils and requires minimal water, making it a valuable crop in arid environments. Its seeds are rich in protein and are often used in traditional cuisines. Additionally, Vigna luteola plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
