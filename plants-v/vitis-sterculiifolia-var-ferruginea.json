    "intro": "Vitis sterculiifolia var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty grapevine, is a variant of the species native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of rusty-colored hairs on its stems and leaves. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by grape-like berries. This variety is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
