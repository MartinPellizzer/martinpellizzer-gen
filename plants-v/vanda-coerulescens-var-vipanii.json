It is characterized by its vibrant blue and violet flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical climate. This variety is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts for its unique coloration and ornamental value."
