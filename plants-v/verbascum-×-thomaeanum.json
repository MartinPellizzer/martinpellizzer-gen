    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 thomaeanum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes several species of flowering plants known for their fuzzy, velvety leaves. The hybrid is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
