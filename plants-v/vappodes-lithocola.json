    "intro": "Vappodes lithocola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is a lichen, a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a flattened structure that helps it retain moisture and withstand extreme temperatures. Its ability to grow on mineral surfaces makes it an important indicator of environmental conditions. Vappodes lithocola plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
