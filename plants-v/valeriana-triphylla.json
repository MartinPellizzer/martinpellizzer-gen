    "intro": "Valeriana triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often reddish-brown roots and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. Valeriana triphylla is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects."
