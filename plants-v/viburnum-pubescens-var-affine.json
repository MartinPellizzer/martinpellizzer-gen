    "intro": "Viburnum pubescens var. affine, commonly known as the Canadian arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are pubescent beneath, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full shade. Viburnum pubescens var. affine is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
