    "intro": "Veronica dissecta, commonly known as the slender speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and deeply dissected, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Veronica dissecta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands."
