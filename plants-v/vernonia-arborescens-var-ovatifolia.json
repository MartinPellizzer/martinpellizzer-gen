    "intro": "Vernonia arborescens var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its fibrous root system and woody stems contribute to its hardy nature, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This species is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
