    "intro": "Vaccinium myrtillus, commonly known as blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and vitamins. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers cool, moist climates. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture and a dark green color. The flowers are bell-shaped and white, giving way to the characteristic blue-black berries that ripen in late summer."
