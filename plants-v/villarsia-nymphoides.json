    "intro": "Villarsia nymphoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, leafless stem and produces delicate, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its unique appearance and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Villarsia nymphoides is considered endangered."
