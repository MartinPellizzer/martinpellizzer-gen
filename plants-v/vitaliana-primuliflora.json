    "intro": "Vitaliana primuliflora, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, often floating on the surface of still water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, while its stems are thick and fibrous. Vitaliana primuliflora has cultural and religious significance in many Asian countries, particularly in Hindu and Buddhist traditions."
