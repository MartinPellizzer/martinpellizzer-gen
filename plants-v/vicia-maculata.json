    "intro": "Vicia maculata, commonly known as the spotted vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish spot on the leaflets, and it produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. Its pods contain several seeds, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Vicia maculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-enriching properties."
