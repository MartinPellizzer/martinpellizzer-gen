    "intro": "Verbena uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Verbena uniflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
