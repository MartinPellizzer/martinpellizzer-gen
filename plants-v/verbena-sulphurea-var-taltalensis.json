    "intro": "Verbena sulphurea var. taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, adapting to the harsh maritime climate. It has narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
