    "intro": "Vimen repens, commonly known as creeping vimen, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It features slender,\u530d\u5310\u830e (prostrate stems) that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Vimen repens is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
