    "intro": "Viola idaea, commonly known as the Edelweiss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive white, woolly flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Pyrenees. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Viola idaea is a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions due to its limited habitat and ecological significance."
