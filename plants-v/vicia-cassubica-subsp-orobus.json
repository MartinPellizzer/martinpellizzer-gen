    "intro": "Vicia cassubica subsp. orobus, commonly known as the Alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple to pink in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Vicia cassubica subsp. orobus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations."
