    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 miyajiana, commonly known as the Japanese violet, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, with a compact, bushy habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Native to Japan, it thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to self-seed, creating a carpet of color in garden settings."
