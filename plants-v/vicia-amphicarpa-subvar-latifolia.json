    "intro": "Vicia amphicarpa subvar. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and often hairy, and its slender, climbing stems that bear small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and soil health."
