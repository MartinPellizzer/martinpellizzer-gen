It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that hang in clusters, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically oval and have a slightly waxy texture. The berries it produces are edible, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other blueberry species."
