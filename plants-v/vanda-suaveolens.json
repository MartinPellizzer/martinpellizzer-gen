    "intro": "Vanda suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for hanging baskets or mounted displays. Vanda suaveolens is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its elegant, aromatic blooms."
