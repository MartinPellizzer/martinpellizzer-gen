    "intro": "Vriesea longicaulis, commonly known as the Long-stemmed Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright inflorescence that can reach several feet in height, supporting a cluster of vibrant, long-lasting flowers. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette, often with a striking green or blue hue. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea longicaulis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
