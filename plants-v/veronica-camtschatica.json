    "intro": "Veronica camtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of blue or violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Veronica camtschatica is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to cold climates."
