    "intro": "Varthemia montana, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Varthemia montana is adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
