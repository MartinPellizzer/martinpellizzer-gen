    "intro": "Vriesea incurvata, commonly known as the curled vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, recurved leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a bluish or silver-green hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea incurvata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
