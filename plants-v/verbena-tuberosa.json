It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, while its stems are usually woody at the base. Verbena tuberosa is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens for its showy blooms and drought tolerance."
