    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. virescens, commonly known as the green grapevine, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the European grapevine. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and the production of small, green grapes that remain unripe even when the rest of the vine matures. The leaves are typically a deep green, and the plant is often found in wild or semi-wild settings. This variety is not widely used for wine production but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique characteristics. Its resilience to certain environmental conditions makes it a subject of research in plant genetics and adaptation."
