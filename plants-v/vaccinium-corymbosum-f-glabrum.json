    "intro": "Vaccinium corymbosum f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf blueberry, is a botanical variant of the highbush blueberry. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of the species. This form is native to North America and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It produces small, edible berries that are similar in flavor to the standard highbush blueberry. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in suitable climates."
