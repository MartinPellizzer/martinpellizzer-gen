It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by triangular, winged seeds. Venilia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
