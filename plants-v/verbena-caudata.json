    "intro": "Verbena caudata, commonly known as whorled verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Verbena caudata thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies add to its ecological value."
