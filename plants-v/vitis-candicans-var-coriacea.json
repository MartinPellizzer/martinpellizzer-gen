    "intro": "Vitis candicans var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned grapevine, is a variant of the grapevine species native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often fissured bark, which gives it its botanical name \"coriacea,\" meaning \"woody\" or \"leathery.\" The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruits are usually small, sour berries that are not typically consumed by humans but are used in traditional medicine. This plant is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid forests and along riverbanks."
