    "intro": "Vernonia triflosculosa, commonly known as the three-flowered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale yellow. Vernonia triflosculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
