    "intro": "Veronica traversii, commonly known as the Alpine Speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Veronica traversii is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
