    "intro": "Vernonia lepidifera, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Vernonia lepidifera is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
