    "intro": "Vicia \u00d7 zabelii, commonly known as the hybrid vetch, is a perennial legume that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Vicia sativa and Vicia villosa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces elongated pods containing several oval seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates contributes to its presence in temperate regions across Europe and Asia."
