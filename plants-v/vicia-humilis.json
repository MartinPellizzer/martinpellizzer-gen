    "intro": "Vicia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Vicia humilis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
