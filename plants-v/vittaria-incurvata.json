    "intro": "Vittaria incurvata, commonly known as the curling fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that curl inward, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Vittaria incurvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
