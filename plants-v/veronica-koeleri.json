    "intro": "Veronica koeleri, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Veronica koeleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, making it a popular choice among gardeners in cooler climates."
