It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a finely toothed margin and a glossy dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of growing conditions."
