    "intro": "Verbascum farinosum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, white hairs that give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme at the top of the stem. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum farinosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
