    "intro": "Vulpia sicula var. setacea, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
