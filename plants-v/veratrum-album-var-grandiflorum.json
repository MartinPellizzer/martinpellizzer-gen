    "intro": "Veratrum album var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the great-flowered white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. Its roots and rhizomes contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
