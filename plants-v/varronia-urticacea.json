    "intro": "Varronia urticacea, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, stinging leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially useful in traditional medicine."
