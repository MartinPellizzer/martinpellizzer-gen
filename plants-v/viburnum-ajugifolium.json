    "intro": "Viburnum ajugifolium, commonly known as the dwarf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Viburnum ajugifolium thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
