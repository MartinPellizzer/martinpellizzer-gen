    "intro": "Vriesea psittacina var. carinata, commonly known as the pink-veined vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, recurved bracts that display a mix of pink, red, and green hues. The plant features a short, sturdy stem with rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often marked with distinctive veining. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
