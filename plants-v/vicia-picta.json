    "intro": "Vicia picta, commonly known as the painted vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, trailing stems with small, trifoliate leaves that have a distinctive white-veined appearance. Its pea-like flowers are typically pale purple or white, and it produces elongated pods containing several seeds. Vicia picta is a perennial plant that plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
