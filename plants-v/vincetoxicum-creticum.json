It is a perennial herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Vincetoxicum creticum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats."
