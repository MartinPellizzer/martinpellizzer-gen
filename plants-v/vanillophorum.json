    "intro": "Vanillophorum, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Mexico and the Philippines. It is a climbing herb with long, spiraling stems that support its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by the characteristic vanilla pods, which are harvested and dried to make vanilla extract. The botanical structure of its flowers includes specialized structures called lip-like petals and a column that houses the reproductive organs. Vanillophorum is notable for its complex floral morphology and its role in the production of one of the world's most prized flavoring agents."
