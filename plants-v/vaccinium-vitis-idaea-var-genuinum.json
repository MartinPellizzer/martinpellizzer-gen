    "intro": "Vaccinium vitis-idaea var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cranberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to boreal and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are tart and red. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. This variety is distinct from other Vaccinium species due to its narrow leaves and specific geographic distribution."
