    "intro": "Vulpia inops var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
