    "intro": "Verbena selaginoides, commonly known as the silverleaf verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Verbena selaginoides is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
