    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. cordata, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
