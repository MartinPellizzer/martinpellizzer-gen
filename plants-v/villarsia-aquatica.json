    "intro": "Villarsia aquatica, commonly known as the water villarsia, is a rare aquatic plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences near the water's edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
