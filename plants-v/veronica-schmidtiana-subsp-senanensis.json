    "intro": "Veronica schmidtiana subsp. senanensis, commonly known as the Senanense speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
