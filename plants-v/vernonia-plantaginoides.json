    "intro": "Vernonia plantaginoides, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its fluffy, blue-gray seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and prairies. Vernonia plantaginoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
