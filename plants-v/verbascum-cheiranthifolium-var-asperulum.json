    "intro": "Verbascum cheiranthifolium var. asperulum, commonly known as the roughleaf mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its common name reflects the rough texture of its leaves, which are covered in fine hairs."
