    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia subsp. segetalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
