    "intro": "Veronica arvensis subsp. bellardii, commonly known as the bellard's speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are usually hairy, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows and along riverbanks. It is part of the Plantaginaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar ecological preferences. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it a common weed in cultivated areas."
