    "intro": "Verbascum decaisneanum, commonly known as the Almondleaf mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its common name reflects the resemblance of its leaves to almond leaves, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
