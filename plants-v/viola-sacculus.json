    "intro": "Viola sacculus, commonly known as the small violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically features heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-colored flowers. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant's flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Its foliage and floral structure are typical of the viola genus, with both ornamental and ecological value in its native habitats."
