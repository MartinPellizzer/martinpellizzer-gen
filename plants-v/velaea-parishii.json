    "intro": "Velaea parishii, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific islands of Samoa and American Samoa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It blooms during the late winter to early spring, which is why it is also called the Christmas star. Velaea parishii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
