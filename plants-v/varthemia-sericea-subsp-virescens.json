    "intro": "Varthemia sericea subsp. virescens, commonly known as the silverleaf groundcherry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are encased in a persistent calyx. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and somewhat rare member of the nightshade family."
