    "intro": "Verbena stellarioides var. decurrens, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color that helps it tolerate dry conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and erosion control."
