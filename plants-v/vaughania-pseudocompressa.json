    "intro": "Vaughania pseudocompressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and its distinctive, narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Vaughania pseudocompressa is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
