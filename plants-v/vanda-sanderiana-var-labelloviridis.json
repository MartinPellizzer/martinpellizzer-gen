    "intro": "Vanda sanderiana var. labelloviridis, commonly known as the Emerald Vanda, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking, vibrant green foliage. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, tropical environments. It produces large, showy flowers in shades of white and green, often with a contrasting lip. Its foliage is dense and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
