    "intro": "Vanilla perexilis, commonly known as the slender vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific species of bees. The plant's most notable feature is its long, thin stem, which allows it to climb and spread across vegetation. Its fruit, a small, fleshy capsule, contains the seeds necessary for reproduction. Despite its ornamental value, Vanilla perexilis is not widely cultivated for vanilla flavoring, unlike its more famous relative, Vanilla planifolia."
