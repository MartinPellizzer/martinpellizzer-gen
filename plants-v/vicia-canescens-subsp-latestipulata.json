    "intro": "Vicia canescens subsp. latestipulata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. The subspecies latestipulata is distinguished by its longer stipules compared to other subspecies of Vicia canescens."
