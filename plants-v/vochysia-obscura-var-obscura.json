    "intro": "Vochysia obscura var. obscura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chile tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
