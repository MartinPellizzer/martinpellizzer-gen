    "intro": "Verbascum calvescens, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and also covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. Verbascum calvescens is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
