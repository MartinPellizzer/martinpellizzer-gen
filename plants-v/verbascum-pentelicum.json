    "intro": "Verbascum pentelicum, commonly known as the Greek mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, candle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
