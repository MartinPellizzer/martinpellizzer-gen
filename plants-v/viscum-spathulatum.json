    "intro": "Viscum spathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the families Fagaceae and Rosaceae. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white berries that are toxic to many animals but serve as a food source for certain birds. Its leaves are lanceolate to ovate, and it is often found in temperate regions of Europe and North America. Viscum spathulatum plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for specific wildlife species."
