    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to acidic, wet habitats such as bogs and heaths. It has small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in the spring. These flowers give way to bright red, juicy berries that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and provides food and habitat for various species."
