    "intro": "Vernonia arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Vernonia arenaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens."
