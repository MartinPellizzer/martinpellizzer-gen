It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to black as they mature. Vitis obtusata is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
