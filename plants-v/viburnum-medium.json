    "intro": "Viburnum medium, commonly known as common snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets, and it produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its bright red, berry-like fruits that appear in the fall, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Viburnum medium typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
