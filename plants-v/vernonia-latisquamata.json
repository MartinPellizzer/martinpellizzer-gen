    "intro": "Vernonia latisquamata, commonly known as the broad-scale ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Vernonia latisquamata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
