    "intro": "Valentina, commonly known as the Valentine's Day cactus, is a hybrid of the Schlumbergera truncata and Schlumbergera russelliana species. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil, where it grows as an epiphytic plant on trees. The plant is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that produce vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the winter months. Valentina thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming cycle is often associated with the holiday season, making it a popular ornamental plant."
