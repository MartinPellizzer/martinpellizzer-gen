It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate climates and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. The plant features slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale blue to purple in color, and it produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds.
