    "intro": "Vulpia hirtiglumis, commonly known as hairy vulpia, is a small annual grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant has slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing spikelets, each with two to three bracts. Vulpia hirtiglumis is often considered a weed but plays a minor role in stabilizing soil in certain environments."
