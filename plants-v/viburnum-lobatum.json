    "intro": "Viburnum lobatum, commonly known as the Pacific dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the western coast of North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Viburnum lobatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
