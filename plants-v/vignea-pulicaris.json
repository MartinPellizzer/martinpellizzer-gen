    "intro": "Vignea pulicaris, commonly known as the creeping woodsorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellow flower that blooms in early spring. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often mistaken for clover. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Vignea pulicaris is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
