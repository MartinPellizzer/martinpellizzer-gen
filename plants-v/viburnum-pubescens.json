It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring, giving it its common name. The plant has ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy, especially along the veins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Viburnum pubescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
