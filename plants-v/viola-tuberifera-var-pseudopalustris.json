    "intro": "Viola tuberifera var. pseudopalustris, commonly known as the bog violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, often in shades of purple or blue, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its tuberous roots, which help it survive in waterlogged conditions."
