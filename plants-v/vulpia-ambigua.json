    "intro": "Vulpia ambigua, commonly known as the false bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats on dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Vulpia ambigua is well adapted to harsh environments and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
