    "intro": "Viburnum cassinoides, commonly known as the fragrant snowball bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, creating a dense, snowball-like appearance. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its fruit is a dark blue to black drupe, which ripens in the fall and is edible for birds. Viburnum cassinoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
