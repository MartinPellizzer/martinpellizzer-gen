    "intro": "Viola sylvestris f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered wood violet, is a botanical variant of the common violet. It is characterized by its pale white or nearly white petals, which distinguish it from the typical purple or violet hues of the species. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and is found in temperate regions of Europe. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
