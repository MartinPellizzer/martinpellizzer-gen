    "intro": "Vitis adstricta var. ternata, commonly known as the creeping grapevine, is a flowering plant species native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and slender, woody stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are typically green when mature. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
