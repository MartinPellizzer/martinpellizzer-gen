    "intro": "Vicia cracca var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sweet clover, is a variant of the common vetch. It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in meadows. It has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it useful in soil enrichment. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
