    "intro": "Vernonia brunioides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of cobalt-blue to violet flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
