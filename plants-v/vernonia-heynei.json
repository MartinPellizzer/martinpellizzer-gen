    "intro": "Vernonia heynei, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flower heads that resemble mist. The plant produces yellowish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Vernonia heynei thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas. Its striking floral display makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
