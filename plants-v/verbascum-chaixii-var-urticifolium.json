    "intro": "Verbascum chaixii var. urticifolium, commonly known as the stinging mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its common name reflects the stinging sensation caused by the fine hairs on its leaves."
