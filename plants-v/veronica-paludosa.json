    "intro": "Veronica paludosa, commonly known as marsh speedwell, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist soils, such as those found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue or purple flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Veronica paludosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting diverse insect life."
