    "intro": "Verbascum blattaria var. majus, commonly known as the greater evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, which are active at night, making it an important species for nocturnal pollinators."
