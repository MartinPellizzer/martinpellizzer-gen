    "intro": "Vicia selloi, commonly known as Sello's vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Vicia selloi is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in certain environments."
