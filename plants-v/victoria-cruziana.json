    "intro": "Victoria cruziana, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its enormous, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that prevents water from seeping through, allowing the plant to float. Its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. The plant plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
