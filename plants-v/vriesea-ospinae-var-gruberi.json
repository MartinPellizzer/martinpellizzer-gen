It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous bracts that display a range of colors from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces inflorescences that are both ornamental and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and relatively compact size, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
