It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive yellow or white keel. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
