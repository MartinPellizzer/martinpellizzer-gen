    "intro": "Vicia truncatula var. pallida, commonly known as the pale vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves with pale green to yellowish foliage. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its small, bean-shaped pods contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Vicia truncatula var. pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
