    "intro": "Viola radicans, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant spreads by runners, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds in garden settings. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Viola radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
