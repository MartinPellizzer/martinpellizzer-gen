    "intro": "Vaccinium oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a blue-black berry that is edible and often used in local cuisines. This species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges."
