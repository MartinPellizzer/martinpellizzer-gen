    "intro": "Vanilla capixaba, commonly known as the Brazilian vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the Amazon rainforest. It produces fragrant, pod-like fruits that are harvested and processed to extract the aromatic compound vanillin. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with high rainfall and rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and dark green, and it has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The vanilla capixaba is an important crop in Brazil, contributing to both local economies and global vanilla markets."
