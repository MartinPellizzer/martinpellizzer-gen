    "intro": "Vitex lanceifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Vitex lanceifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
