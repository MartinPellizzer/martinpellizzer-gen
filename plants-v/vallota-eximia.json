    "intro": "Vallota eximia, commonly known as the noble vallota, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Vallota eximia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
