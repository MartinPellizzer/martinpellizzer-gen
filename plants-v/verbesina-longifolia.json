    "intro": "Verbesina longifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which can make it difficult to handle. Verbesina longifolia is often found in moist, open habitats like woodlands and wetlands."
