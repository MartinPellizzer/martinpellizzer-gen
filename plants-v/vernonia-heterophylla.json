    "intro": "Vernonia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from lanceolate to ovate, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to wet soils, such as in swamps or along stream banks. Vernonia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
