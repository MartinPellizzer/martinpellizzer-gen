    "intro": "Vellozia squamata, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a striking plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its unique, grass-like appearance with narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. Vellozia squamata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
