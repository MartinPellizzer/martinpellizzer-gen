    "intro": "Viscum montanum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various hardwood trees. It has a distinctive appearance with smooth, waxy leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are typically red or yellow, containing sticky seeds that adhere to tree bark. Viscum montanum is well adapted to its host environment, relying on the host tree for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations that feed on its berries."
