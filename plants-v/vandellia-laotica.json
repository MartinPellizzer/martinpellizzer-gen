    "intro": "Vandellia laotica, commonly known as the Laotian vandellia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Laos. It belongs to the family Vandelliaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a unique morphology that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Vandellia laotica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
