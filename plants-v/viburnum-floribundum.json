    "intro": "Viburnum floribundum, commonly known as the common snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its fruit is a dark blue, spherical drupe that ripens in the summer, providing food for birds and small mammals. Viburnum floribundum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
