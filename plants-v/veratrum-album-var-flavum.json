    "intro": "Veratrum album var. flavum, commonly known as the yellow hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or yellowish flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
