    "intro": "Vanda guibertii, commonly known as the Guibert\u2019s vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, often with a velvety texture. Vanda guibertii thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat."
