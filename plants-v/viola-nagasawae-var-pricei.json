    "intro": "Viola nagasawae var. pricei, commonly known as the Price's violet, is a rare and striking member of the Violaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Japan, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a deep green hue and produces delicate, violet-pink flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and unique floral morphology. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
