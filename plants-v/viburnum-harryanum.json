    "intro": "Viburnum harryanum, commonly known as the Harryanum viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, featuring a dense, rounded form with multiple stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the autumn. Viburnum harryanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its seasonal interest and structural form."
