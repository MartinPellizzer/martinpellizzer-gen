    "intro": "Vittaria japonica, commonly known as the Japanese spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, moss-like mats. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, spore-bearing structures called sporangium clusters. Vittaria japonica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
