    "intro": "Vernonia leucophylla, commonly known as whiteleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pale yellow to white flower heads. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Vernonia leucophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
