    "intro": "Vallisneria annua, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by cylindrical, spirally twisted fruits. Vallisneria annua is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
