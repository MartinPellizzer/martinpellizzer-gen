    "intro": "Verbena pubera, commonly known as hairy verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are characteristic features that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Verbena pubera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
