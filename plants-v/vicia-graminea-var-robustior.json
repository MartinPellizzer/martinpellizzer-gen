    "intro": "Vicia graminea var. robustior, commonly known as the robust common vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect or sprawling growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. This species is often used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
