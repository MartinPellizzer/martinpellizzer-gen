    "intro": "Vernonia clinopodioides, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, erect stems contribute to its distinctive appearance. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing a showy display of blue to purple coloration that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
