    "intro": "Viburnum antioquiense, commonly known as the Antioquian honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Viburnum antioquiense thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal floral displays."
