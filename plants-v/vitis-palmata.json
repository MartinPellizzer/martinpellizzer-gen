    "intro": "Vitis palmata, commonly known as the palmate grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it its common name, and its ability to climb using tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of round, edible berries. Vitis palmata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
