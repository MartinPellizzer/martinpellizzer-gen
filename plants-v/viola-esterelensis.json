It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
