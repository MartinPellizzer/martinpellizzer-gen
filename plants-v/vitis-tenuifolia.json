    "intro": "Vitis tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into clusters of berries, which are typically dark purple when mature. Vitis tenuifolia is often found in woodland areas and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. It is not commonly cultivated for fruit but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
