    "intro": "Verbena turneri, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, four-petaled flowers are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Verbena turneri is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
