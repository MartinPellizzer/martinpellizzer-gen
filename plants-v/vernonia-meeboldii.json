    "intro": "Vernonia meeboldii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Vernonia meeboldii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging climates."
