    "intro": "Viola pumila var. ericetorum, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple hue, often adorned with a white or pale violet marking near the base. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring, usually in shades of violet or blue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
