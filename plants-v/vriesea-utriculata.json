    "intro": "Vriesea utriculata, commonly known as the bladder bromeliad, is a species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking red and yellow flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea utriculata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance."
