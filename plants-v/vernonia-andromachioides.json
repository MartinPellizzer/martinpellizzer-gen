    "intro": "Vernonia andromachioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its fibrous root system and hairy stems are adaptations to its native sandy and rocky soils. Vernonia andromachioides is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas."
