It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
