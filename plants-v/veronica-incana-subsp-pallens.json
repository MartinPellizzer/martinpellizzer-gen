It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Veronica incana subsp. pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
