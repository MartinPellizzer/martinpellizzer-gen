    "intro": "Vignea ammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects. Vignea ammophila is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with well-drained soil."
