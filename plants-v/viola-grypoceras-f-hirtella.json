    "intro": "Viola grypoceras f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy violet, is a botanical variant of the viola genus characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves and violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. The hairy texture of its leaves distinguishes it from other viola species and contributes to its unique appearance."
