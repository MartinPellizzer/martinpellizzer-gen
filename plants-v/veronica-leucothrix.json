    "intro": "Veronica leucothrix, commonly known as the silverweed or white hair vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats. The plant features small, bright blue or purple flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a silver-green hue, contributing to its common name. Veronica leucothrix thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
