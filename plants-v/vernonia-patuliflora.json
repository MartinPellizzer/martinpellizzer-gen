    "intro": "Vernonia patuliflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in rough, hairy foliage. Its showy, yellow-orange flower heads appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Vernonia patuliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
