    "intro": "Vepris trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved Indian frankincense, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are typically followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its essential oil, derived from the leaves and twigs, is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Vepris trifoliolata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded forest undergrowth."
