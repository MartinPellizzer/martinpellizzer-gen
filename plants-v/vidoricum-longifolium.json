    "intro": "Vidoricum longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf vidoricum, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, adorned with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by slender, cylindrical fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild aromatic properties. Vidoricum longifolium thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens."
