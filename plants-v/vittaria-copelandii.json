    "intro": "Vittaria copelandii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria copelandii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
