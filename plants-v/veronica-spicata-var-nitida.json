    "intro": "Veronica spicata var. nitida, commonly known as silver sprays, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, giving the plant a distinctive silvery appearance due to the fine downy covering. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and early spring blooming period."
