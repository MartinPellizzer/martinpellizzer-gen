    "intro": "Verbesina biserrata, commonly known as the roughleaf beggar-ticks, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as marshes and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
