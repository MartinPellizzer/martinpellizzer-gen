    "intro": "Vitis piasezkii, commonly known as the Russian grape or Siberian grape, is a species of flowering vine native to eastern Russia and parts of northern China. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Vitis piasezkii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Its berries are not typically consumed by humans but are used in traditional medicine in some regions."
