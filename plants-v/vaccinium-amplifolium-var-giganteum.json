    "intro": "Vaccinium amplifolium var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant huckleberry, is a variant of the huckleberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to blueberries but are typically larger and more tart. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with ample sunlight. This variant is valued both for its ecological role and its potential use in local cuisine."
