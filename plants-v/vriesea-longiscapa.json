    "intro": "Vriesea longiscapa, commonly known as the long-spurred vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a central water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are often borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea longiscapa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
