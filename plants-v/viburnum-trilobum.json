    "intro": "Viburnum trilobum, commonly known as American cranberrybush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible but tart. Viburnum trilobum typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and has dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
