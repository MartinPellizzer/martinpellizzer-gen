    "intro": "Viola thorii, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Violaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue. Viola thorii thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
