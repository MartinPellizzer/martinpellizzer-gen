    "intro": "Vicia hyrcanica, commonly known as the Hyrcanian vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the spring. Vicia hyrcanica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
