    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia var. simplex, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, with ascending stems that bear the flowering clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
