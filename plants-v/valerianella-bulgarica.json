It typically features a prostrate or ascending stem with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks.
