    "intro": "Viola rugulosa, commonly known as the wrinkled violet, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the forest floor. Viola rugulosa is also noted for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
