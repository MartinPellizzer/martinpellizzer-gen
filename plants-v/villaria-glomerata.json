It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Villaria glomerata is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
