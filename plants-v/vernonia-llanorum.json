    "intro": "Vernonia llanorum, commonly known as the plains ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, dark purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Vernonia llanorum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
