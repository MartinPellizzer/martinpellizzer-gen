    "intro": "Viscum subserratum, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which is usually dark green and has a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Viscum subserratum has a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations, as its berries are a food source for certain species."
