    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia var. elatior, commonly known as the greater slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
