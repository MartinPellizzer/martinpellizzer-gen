    "intro": "Vrydagzynea samoana, commonly known as the Samoan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the islands of Samoa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with the female cones bearing ovules that develop into seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Vrydagzynea samoana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
