    "intro": "Vitex elegans, commonly known as chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late summer. The plant is known for its showy panicles that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. The berries that follow the flowers are small, dark blue, and contain toxic compounds, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
