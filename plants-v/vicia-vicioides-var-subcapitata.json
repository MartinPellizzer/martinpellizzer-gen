It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes, giving it its varietal name. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
