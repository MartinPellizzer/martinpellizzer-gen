It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its tall, erect stems and purple to brown flower clusters. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Vernonia neumanniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
