    "intro": "Verbena thymifolia, commonly known as lemon verbena, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and often used in herbal teas. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high levels of volatile oils, giving it a strong lemon scent. Verbena thymifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties."
