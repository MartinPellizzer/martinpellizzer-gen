It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its ability to thrive in cold, acidic soils. Its berries, which are typically blue or black, are edible and have a tart flavor. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in harsh climates."
