    "intro": "Vaccinium lageniforme, commonly known as the bottlebrush blueberry, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, bottle-shaped berries that range in color from blue to black. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Vaccinium lageniforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible berries, which are favored by birds and some wildlife species."
