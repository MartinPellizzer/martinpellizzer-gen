    "intro": "Viscum mangiferae, commonly known as the mango mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of mango trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can significantly affect the host tree's health if left unchecked. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that attract birds and other animals. Viscum mangiferae is native to parts of Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
