    "intro": "Vellozia trichophylla, commonly known as the woolly vellozia, is a unique member of the family Velloziaceae, native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. It is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its leaves. Vellozia trichophylla is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is a popular specimen plant due to its distinctive appearance and hardy nature."
