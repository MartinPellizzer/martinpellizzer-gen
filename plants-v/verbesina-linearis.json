    "intro": "Verbesina linearis, commonly known as slender beggarticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Verbesina linearis is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
