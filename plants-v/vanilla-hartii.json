    "intro": "Vanilla hartii, commonly known as the giant vanilla or the Mexican vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. Its vanilla pods, which develop after pollination, are smaller and less aromatic compared to those of Vanilla planifolia. This species is valued for its unique flavor profile and is used in culinary and aromatic applications."
