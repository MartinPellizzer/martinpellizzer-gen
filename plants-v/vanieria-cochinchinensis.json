    "intro": "Vanieria cochinchinensis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form a dense network beneath the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are composed of small, overlapping pinnae, which help in photosynthesis and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
