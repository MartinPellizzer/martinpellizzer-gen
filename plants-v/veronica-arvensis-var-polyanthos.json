    "intro": "Veronica arvensis var. polyanthos, commonly known as the polyanthus speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in cultivated areas. The flowers are typically clustered in pairs, giving the plant its characteristic appearance."
