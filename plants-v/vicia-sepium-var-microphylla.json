    "intro": "Vicia sepium var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved field vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in hedgerows, along roadsides, and in meadows. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
