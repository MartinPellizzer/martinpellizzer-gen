    "intro": "Vitis lenticellata, commonly known as the rough-skinned grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to North America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in small, raised pores called lenticels, which aid in gas exchange. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Vitis lenticellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
