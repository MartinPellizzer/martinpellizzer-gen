    "intro": "Vicia lutea subsp. muricata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This subspecies is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop and forage plant."
