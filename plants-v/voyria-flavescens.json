    "intro": "Voyria flavescens, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Voyria flavescens is an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems due to its specific habitat requirements."
