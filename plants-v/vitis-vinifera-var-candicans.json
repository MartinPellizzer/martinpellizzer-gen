    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. candicans, commonly known as the golden grapevine, is a cultivar of the common grapevine species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage and clusters of sweet, aromatic grapes that ripen in late summer. The plant is a vigorous vine with tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across trellises or natural structures. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five leaflets and small, clustered flowers that precede the grape clusters. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential for producing unique, flavorful wines."
