    "intro": "Verbena humifusa var. reticulata, commonly known as the creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its foliage is narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
