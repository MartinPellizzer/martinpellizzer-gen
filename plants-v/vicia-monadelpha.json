It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Vicia monadelpha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including fields and along roadsides.
