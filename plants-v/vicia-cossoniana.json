    "intro": "Vicia cossoniana, commonly known as the Cosson's vetch, is a flowering plant species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vicia cossoniana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in soil enrichment and erosion control."
