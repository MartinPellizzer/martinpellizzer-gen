    "intro": "Vitis trifoliata var. tuberculata, commonly known as the Japanese grape or mountain grape, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its distinctive tuberculate (bumpy) texture on the stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible berries, which are typically sour but can be used in traditional foods. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
