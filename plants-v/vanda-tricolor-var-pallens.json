It is characterized by its striking three-colored flowers, which typically display shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has thick, fleshy roots adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks and branches. Its leaves are broad and waxy, helping to retain moisture in its natural habitat. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beautiful, long-lasting blooms."
