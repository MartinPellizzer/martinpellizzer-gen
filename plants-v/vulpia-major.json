    "intro": "Vulpia major, commonly known as the common vulpia, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, awned florets. Vulpia major is known for its adaptability and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
