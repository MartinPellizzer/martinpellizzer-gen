It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that give way to elongated, narrow pods containing edible seeds. Vigna nervosa is often grown for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various cuisines. Its botanical features make it well-suited for warm climates and poor soils."
