    "intro": "Viscum pedunculatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various trees and shrubs. It possesses a specialized root system called a haustellum, which attaches to the host plant and extracts water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture. Viscum pedunculatum plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
