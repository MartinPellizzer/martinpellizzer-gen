    "intro": "Vicia claessensii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. It produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia claessensii is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
