    "intro": "Valeriana norica, commonly known as the Alpine valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high altitudes. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white. Valeriana norica is known for its strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its essential oils. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential calming and sedative properties."
