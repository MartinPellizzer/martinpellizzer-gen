    "intro": "[WRONG START] Viscum reichenbachianianum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, glossy leaves and white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds that help disperse its seeds. Viscum reichenbachianum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems and has cultural and traditional significance in various regions."
