    "intro": "Viola lehmannii subsp. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has heart-shaped, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, often featuring a distinctive white or pale yellow throat. Its foliage is usually covered in a fine, downy layer, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to its woodland habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
