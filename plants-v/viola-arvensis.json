    "intro": "Viola arvensis, commonly known as the field violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, and its flowers are usually violet or blue with yellow markings. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Viola arvensis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
