    "intro": "Vaccinium nummularia var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the oblong-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, tart blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as bogs and heaths. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
