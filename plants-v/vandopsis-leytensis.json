    "intro": "Vandopsis leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte vandopsis, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
