    "intro": "Vitex grandifolia, commonly known as the chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds. Vitex grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
