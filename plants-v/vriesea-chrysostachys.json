    "intro": "Vriesea chrysostachys, commonly known as the golden torch bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a cup-like structure to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange to red inflorescences that resemble torches, which bloom repeatedly over several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea chrysostachys is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
