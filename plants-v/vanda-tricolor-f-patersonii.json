    "intro": "Vanda tricolor f. patersonii, commonly known as the Paterson's vanda, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking tricolor flowers, which typically display shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda tricolor f. patersonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience in cultivation."
