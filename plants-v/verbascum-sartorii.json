It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense, branching inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats. Verbascum sartorii is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on the respiratory system."
