    "intro": "Vitis tiliacea, commonly known as the Mexican grape or tiliacea vine, is a climbing plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its tendrils and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by clusters of small, sweet-tart berries. Vitis tiliacea is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
