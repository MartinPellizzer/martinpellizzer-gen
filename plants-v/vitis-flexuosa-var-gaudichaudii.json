It is characterized by its vigorous growth and flexible stems that allow it to twine around supports. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a glossy surface and deep green color. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to dark purple as it ripens. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both horticultural and traditional uses."
