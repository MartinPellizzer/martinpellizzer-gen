    "intro": "Verbena hispida, commonly known as hairy verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Verbena hispida is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
