    "intro": "Vitis amurensis var. coignetiae, commonly known as the Amur grape or Coignet's grape, is a cold-hardy vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and ability to thrive in temperate to subarctic climates. The plant produces clusters of small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a woody vine structure that can climb or sprawl along the ground. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in winemaking and forage."
