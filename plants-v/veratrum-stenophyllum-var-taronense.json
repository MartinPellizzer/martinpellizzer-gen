    "intro": "Veratrum stenophyllum var. taronense, commonly known as the Taronese white hellebore, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
