    "intro": "Veratrum bosniacum var. albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, smooth-stemmed structure and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in remote, less disturbed habitats."
