    "intro": "Vulpia myuros var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are typically hairy, especially along the edges, giving it its common name. Vulpia myuros var. ciliata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats."
