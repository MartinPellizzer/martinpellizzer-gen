    "intro": "Viburnum prunifolium var. ferrugineum, commonly known as the rustyleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are often tinged with rust-colored veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators and providing food for birds."
