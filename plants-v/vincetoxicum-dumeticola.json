    "intro": "Vincetoxicum dumeticola, commonly known as the creeping false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its stems are hairy and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in suitable conditions. Vincetoxicum dumeticola is often considered a weed due to its invasive nature in cultivated areas."
