    "intro": "Vicia tetrasperma subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its pods are slender and contain several small, rounded seeds. This species is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
