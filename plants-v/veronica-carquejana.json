    "intro": "Veronica carquejana, commonly known as the Carquejana speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Veronica carquejana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
