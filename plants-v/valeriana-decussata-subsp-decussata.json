    "intro": "Valeriana decussata subsp. decussata, commonly known as the clustered valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a strong, sometimes disagreeable aroma. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
