    "intro": "Vicia rafigae, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb with slender, trailing stems that often grow along rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or purple, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually hairy and oval in shape. Vicia rafigae is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
