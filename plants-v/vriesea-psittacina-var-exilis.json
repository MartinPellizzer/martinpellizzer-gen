It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright blue bracts that resemble stars, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
