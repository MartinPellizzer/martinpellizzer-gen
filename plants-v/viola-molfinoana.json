    "intro": "Viola molfinoana, commonly known as the Molfino violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Dolomites. The plant is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
