    "intro": "Veronica prasifolia, commonly known as the mossy speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, moss-like coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Veronica prasifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
