    "intro": "Vellozia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spiky, woody stems that often branch out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are modified into short, stiff bracts, and it has a distinctive, almost cactus-like appearance. Vellozia glandulifera is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a notable example of xerophytic evolution."
