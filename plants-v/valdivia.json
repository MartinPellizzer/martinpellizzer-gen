    "intro": "Valdivia, commonly known as the Valdivia tree or *Lithraea molleoides*, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is a small, evergreen tree that typically grows in the temperate rainforests of Chile and Argentina. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, fleshy fruits. Valdivia is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and furniture. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native environment."
