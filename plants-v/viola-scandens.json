    "intro": "Viola scandens, commonly known as the creeping viola, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. Viola scandens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to spread easily through stolons."
