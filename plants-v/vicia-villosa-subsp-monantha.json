    "intro": "Vicia villosa subsp. monantha, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and its capacity to suppress weeds. Vicia villosa subsp. monantha is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
