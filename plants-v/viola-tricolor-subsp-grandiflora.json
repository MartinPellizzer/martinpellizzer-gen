    "intro": "Viola tricolor subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet and white coloration, and its flowers are larger than those of the typical Viola tricolor. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
