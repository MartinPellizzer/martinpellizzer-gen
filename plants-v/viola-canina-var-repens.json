    "intro": "Viola canina var. repens, commonly known as creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet-blue coloration and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
