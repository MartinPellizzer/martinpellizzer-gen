    "intro": "Vaccinium laetum var. undulatum, commonly known as the undulating blueberry, is a variant of the highbush blueberry native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and undulating, wavy leaf margins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, and it bears edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential for cultivation in suitable climates."
