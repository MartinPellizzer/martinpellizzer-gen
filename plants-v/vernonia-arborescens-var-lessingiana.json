It is characterized by its striking, blue-gray foliage and fluffy, lavender-pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. The botanical features of this variety contribute to its ecological value, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
