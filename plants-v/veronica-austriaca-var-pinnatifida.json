    "intro": "Veronica austriaca var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Austrian speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of oval, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in garden settings."
