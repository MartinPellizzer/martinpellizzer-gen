    "intro": "Vigna racemosa, commonly known as the cluster bean or sickle bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and pinnate leaves composed of three to five oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. Vigna racemosa is valued for its edible seeds, which are used in various cuisines, and for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It is also cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
