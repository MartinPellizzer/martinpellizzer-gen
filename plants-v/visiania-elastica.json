    "intro": "Visiania elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its flexible, serpentine stems that can elongate significantly, often reaching lengths of several meters. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough, hairy texture. Visiania elastica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical areas for horticultural purposes."
