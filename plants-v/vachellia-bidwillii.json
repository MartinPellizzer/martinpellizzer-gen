    "intro": "Vachellia bidwillii, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like crown of long, slender branches. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves that are often shed during dry periods, allowing it to conserve water. It produces yellow flowers followed by long, thin pods that contain edible seeds. Vachellia bidwillii is well adapted to arid environments and plays an important role in desert ecosystems."
