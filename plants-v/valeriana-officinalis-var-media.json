It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter tall, bearing opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, spicy aroma. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana officinalis var. media thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
