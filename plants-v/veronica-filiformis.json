    "intro": "Veronica filiformis, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Veronica filiformis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
