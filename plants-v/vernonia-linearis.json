It features upright, slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are linear, narrow, and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia linearis is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
