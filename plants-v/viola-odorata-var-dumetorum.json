It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny, black seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Its aromatic flowers and historical use in perfumery and medicine highlight its botanical and cultural significance."
