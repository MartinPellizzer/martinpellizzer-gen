    "intro": "Viburnum inopinatum, commonly known as the Canadian arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. Viburnum inopinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest and wildlife value. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun."
