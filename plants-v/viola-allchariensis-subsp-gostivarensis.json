It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple and violet. It is characterized by its small size and preference for calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
