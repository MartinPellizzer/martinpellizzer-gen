    "intro": "Viscago fabaria, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. Viscago fabaria is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used historically in traditional medicine."
