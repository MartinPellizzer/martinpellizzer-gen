    "intro": "Vriesea caldasiana, commonly known as the Caldasian Vriesea, is a striking tropical bromeliad native to Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports aquatic life. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea caldasiana is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
