    "intro": "Vella pseudocytisus subsp. anremerica, commonly known as the American buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in certain regions."
