    "intro": "Villadia galeottiana, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its complex ecological relationships."
