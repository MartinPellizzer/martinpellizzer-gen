    "intro": "Vernonia divaricata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its blue to purple flowers appear in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia divaricata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance once established."
