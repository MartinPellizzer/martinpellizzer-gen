    "intro": "Viscum salicornioides, commonly known as sea oak or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a shrub that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shores and dunes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Viscum salicornioides plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
