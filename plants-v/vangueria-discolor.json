    "intro": "Vangueria discolor, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Vangueria discolor is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
