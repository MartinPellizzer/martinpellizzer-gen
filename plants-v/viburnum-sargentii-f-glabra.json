    "intro": "Viburnum sargentii f. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf snowberry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glabrous surface that distinguishes this form from other viburnum species. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and supporting local wildlife."
