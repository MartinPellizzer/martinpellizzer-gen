It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. The tree is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan."
