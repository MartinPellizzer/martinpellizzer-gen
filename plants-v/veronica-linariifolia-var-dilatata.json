    "intro": "Veronica linariifolia var. dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of oval, dark green leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-to-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, attractive ground cover."
