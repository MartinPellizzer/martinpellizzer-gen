    "intro": "Verbena atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in dry climates."
