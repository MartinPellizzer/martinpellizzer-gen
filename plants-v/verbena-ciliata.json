    "intro": "Verbena ciliata, commonly known as the scarlet verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces showy spikes of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom throughout the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Verbena ciliata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
