    "intro": "Vicia piscidia, commonly known as water vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vicia piscidia is adapted to moist environments and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and along the edges of water bodies. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
