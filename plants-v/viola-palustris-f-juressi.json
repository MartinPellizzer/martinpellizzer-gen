It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy violet flowers with five petals, often in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
