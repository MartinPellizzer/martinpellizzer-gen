    "intro": "Vandopsis raymundii, commonly known as the Raymund's vandopsis, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in tropical ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
