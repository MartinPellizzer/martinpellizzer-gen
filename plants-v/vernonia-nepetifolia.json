It is a herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.
