It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia bathiaei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
