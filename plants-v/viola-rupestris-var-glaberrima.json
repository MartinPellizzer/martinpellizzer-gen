    "intro": "Viola rupestris var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous rock violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems that become glabrous (hairless) as the plant matures. The leaves are heart-shaped and typically have a velvety texture, while the flowers are violet-blue in color with five petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky garden environments."
