    "intro": "Vaccinium candidum, commonly known as the white highbush blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its foliage consists of oval, dark green leaves that are glossy and aromatic. Vaccinium candidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of unique, flavorful berries."
