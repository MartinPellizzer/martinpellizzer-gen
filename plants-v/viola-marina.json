    "intro": "Viola marina, commonly known as sea viol, is a coastal plant native to the shores of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas subject to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, typically between March and May. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Viola marina is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
