It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible and often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Viburnum schensianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in gardens and natural habitats."
