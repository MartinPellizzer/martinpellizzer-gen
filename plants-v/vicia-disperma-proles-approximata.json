    "intro": "Vicia disperma proles approximata, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes. Its pods are slender, cylindrical, and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
