    "intro": "Vitex eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' chaste tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It belongs to the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in shrubland and rocky habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
