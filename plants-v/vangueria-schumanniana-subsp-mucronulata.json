    "intro": "Vangueria schumanniana subsp. mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vangueria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance."
