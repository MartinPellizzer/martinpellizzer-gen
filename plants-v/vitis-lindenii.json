    "intro": "Vitis lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg grape, is a rare and ancient vine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color. Vitis lindenii is valued for its historical significance in traditional medicine and its potential as a source of unique botanical compounds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
