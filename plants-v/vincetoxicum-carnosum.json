    "intro": "Vincetoxicum carnosum, commonly known as the woolly bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and clusters of small, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Vincetoxicum carnosum is known for its aggressive growth habit and can become invasive in certain environments. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas."
