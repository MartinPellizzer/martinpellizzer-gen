    "intro": "Vachellia globulifera, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its long, drooping branches. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-adapted to dry climates. The tree is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in degraded areas."
