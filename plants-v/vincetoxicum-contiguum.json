    "intro": "Vincetoxicum contiguum, commonly known as the creeping woodbine, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Vincetoxicum contiguum is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
