    "intro": "Viburnum propinquum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clustered inflorescences during early spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and moist forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
