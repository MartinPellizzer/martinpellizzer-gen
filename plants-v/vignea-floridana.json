    "intro": "Vignea floridana, commonly known as the Florida vigna, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. Vignea floridana is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. However, it is considered a rare and threatened species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
