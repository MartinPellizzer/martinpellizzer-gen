    "intro": "Vriesea mollis, commonly known as the \"sword fern\" or \"banana plant,\" is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, forming a rosette structure that holds water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow. Vriesea mollis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a decorative plant due to its exotic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
