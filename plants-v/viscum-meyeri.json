    "intro": "Viscum meyeri, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees such as oak, apple, and poplar. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum meyeri has a dense, evergreen foliage that forms a spherical or oval shape, often creating a visible green mass on its host. It is an important part of the ecosystem, providing food for birds and insects during the winter months."
