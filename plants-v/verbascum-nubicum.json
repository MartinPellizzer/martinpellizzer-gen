    "intro": "Verbascum nubicum, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is a perennial herb that grows from a woody base, with tall, hairy stems that can reach up to two meters in height. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of soft, downy hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Verbascum nubicum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
