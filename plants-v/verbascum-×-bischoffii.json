    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 bischoffii, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum thapsus. It is a tall, biennial or short-lived perennial plant characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its common name reflects its resemblance to the common mullein, with which it shares some botanical features."
