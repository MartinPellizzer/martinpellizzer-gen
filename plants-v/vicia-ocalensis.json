It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Vicia ocalensis is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
