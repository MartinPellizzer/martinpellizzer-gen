    "intro": "Vaccinium ursinum, commonly known as the bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals, including bears. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Vaccinium ursinum plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
