    "intro": "Verbascum lagurus, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs, which give it a distinctive fluffy appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and also covered in fine, silky hairs. Verbascum lagurus is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils."
