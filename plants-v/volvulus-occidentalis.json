    "intro": "Volvulus occidentalis, commonly known as the western spiral vine, is a climbing plant native to the temperate regions of the western hemisphere. It is characterized by its helical growth pattern, with twisted stems that coil around supports as it grows. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin. Volvulus occidentalis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
