    "intro": "Vatica parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and lanceolate leaves that are typically small and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery). The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
