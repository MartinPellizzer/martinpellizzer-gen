    "intro": "Verbascum rotundifolium var. ripacurcicum, commonly known as the round-leaved mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are rounded in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is closely related to other members of the Scrophulariaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
