    "intro": "Veronica turbicola, commonly known as the mountain veronica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Veronica turbicola is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
