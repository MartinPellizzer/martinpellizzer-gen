    "intro": "Verbascum simplex var. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in dense, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional medicinal uses."
