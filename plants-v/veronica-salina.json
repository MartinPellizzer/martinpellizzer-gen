    "intro": "Veronica salina, commonly known as saltwort, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is native to coastal areas and salt marshes in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. Its small blue or purple flowers are typically clustered in spikes, and it produces small, round fruits. Veronica salina plays a role in stabilizing soil in coastal regions and is sometimes used in phytoremediation to absorb excess salt from the soil."
