    "intro": "Viscum heteranthum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for attachment and absorption. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, sticky berries that are dispersed by birds. Viscum heteranthum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting a variety of wildlife species."
