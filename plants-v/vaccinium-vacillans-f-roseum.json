    "intro": "Vaccinium vacillans f. roseum, commonly known as the pink-leaved huckleberry, is a botanical variant of the Vaccinium vacillans species. It is characterized by its striking pink to rose-colored foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the parent species. This form thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to other Vaccinium species. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture for its unique coloration and ecological benefits."
