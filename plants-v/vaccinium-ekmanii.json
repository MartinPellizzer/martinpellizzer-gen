    "intro": "Vaccinium ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruits are edible, small berries that are typically blue or purple in color, and are used both for culinary purposes and in traditional medicine. Vaccinium ekmanii is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salty air and sandy soils."
