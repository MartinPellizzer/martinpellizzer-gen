    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 ganeschinii, commonly known as the hybrid violet, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Viola lutea and Viola tricolor, resulting in a plant with distinctive violet and yellow flowers. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant, bi-colored blooms that appear in early spring."
