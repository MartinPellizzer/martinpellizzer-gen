    "intro": "Valerianella fallax, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Valerianella fallax thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions and a useful plant for ecological gardens."
