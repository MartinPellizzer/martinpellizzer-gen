    "intro": "Vigna nigritia, commonly known as black gram or urad dal, is a leguminous plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, slender pods that contain small, round, dark-colored seeds. These seeds are rich in protein and are widely used in various cuisines, particularly in Indian and Southeast Asian cooking. Vigna nigritia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important crop in sustainable agricultural systems."
