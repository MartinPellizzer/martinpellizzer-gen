    "intro": "Viburnum primina, commonly known as the early viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes. Viburnum primina thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
