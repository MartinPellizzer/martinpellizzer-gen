    "intro": "Vicia pallida f. paucifolia, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its reduced leaflet count. It is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its slender stems and sparse foliage make it distinct from the typical form of Vicia pallida. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
