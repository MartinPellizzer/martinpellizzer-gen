    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. eradiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf European cranberry bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin. Viburnum opulus var. eradiatum is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive form and seasonal interest."
