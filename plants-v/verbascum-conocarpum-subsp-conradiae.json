    "intro": "Verbascum conocarpum subsp. conradiae, commonly known as the Conrad's mullein, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
