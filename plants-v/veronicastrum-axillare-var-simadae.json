    "intro": "Veronicastrum axillare var. simadae, commonly known as the Simadae blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with clusters of small, sky-blue flowers. The plant produces showy, raceme-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a slight hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
