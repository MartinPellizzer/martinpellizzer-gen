    "intro": "Vincetoxicum adnatum, commonly known as the European greenbriar, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Vincetoxicum adnatum is known for its vigorous growth and ability to form dense thickets."
