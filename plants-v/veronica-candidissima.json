    "intro": "Veronica candidissima, commonly known as the white speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and flowering habits make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant."
