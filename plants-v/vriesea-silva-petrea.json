    "intro": "Vriesea silva-petrea, commonly known as the Silva-Petra Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height, forming a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
