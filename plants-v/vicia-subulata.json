    "intro": "Vicia subulata, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia subulata is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria in its root system."
