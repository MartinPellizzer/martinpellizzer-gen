    "intro": "Vaccinium crenatifolium, commonly known as the alpine blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, often found in alpine tundra and boreal forests. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in local culinary traditions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with wavy edges, and the plant has a dense, mat-forming growth habit. Vaccinium crenatifolium plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh habitat."
