    "intro": "Viguiera speciosa, commonly known as Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, and it thrives in full sun. Its showy, lavender-pink flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Viguiera speciosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
