    "intro": "Verbena flava f. abortiva, commonly known as the pale verbena, is a compact, flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hybrid form of Verbena flava, characterized by its shorter stature and reduced flowering compared to the typical species. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to lavender. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
