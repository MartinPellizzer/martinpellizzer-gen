    "intro": "Veronica quadrifolia, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Veronica quadrifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
