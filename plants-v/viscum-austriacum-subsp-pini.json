    "intro": "Viscum austriacum subsp. pini, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of coniferous trees, primarily pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the limited foliage it possesses. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and birds. Its life cycle involves bird-dispersed seeds that germinate on the bark of host trees, establishing a parasitic relationship."
