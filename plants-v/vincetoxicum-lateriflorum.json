    "intro": "Vincetoxicum lateriflorum, commonly known as the clustered false bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is sometimes offset by its invasive tendencies in certain regions."
