It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, hairy pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for certain insect species."
