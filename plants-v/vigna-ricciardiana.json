    "intro": "Vigna ricciardiana, commonly known as the climbing bean or Ricciardiana cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb and entangle other vegetation, often found in disturbed areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. Vigna ricciardiana is valued for its nutritional seeds and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
