    "intro": "Vriesea \u00d7 gracilis, commonly known as the slender vriesea, is a hybrid bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the center. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea \u00d7 gracilis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
