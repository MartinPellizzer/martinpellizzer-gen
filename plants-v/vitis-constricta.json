    "intro": "Vitis constricta, commonly known as the creeping grape or wild grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet berries that ripen in the fall. Vitis constricta is often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
