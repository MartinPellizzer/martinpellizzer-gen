    "intro": "Veronica vandellioides, commonly known as the sand veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
