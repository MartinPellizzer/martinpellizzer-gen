    "intro": "Vitis thunbergii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. The species is also noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
