    "intro": "Vicia bithynica var. major, commonly known as the Greater Bithynian Vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces slender, erect stems and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
