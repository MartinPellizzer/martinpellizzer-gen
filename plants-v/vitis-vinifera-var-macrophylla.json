    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf grapevine, is a variety of the common grapevine characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It produces clusters of small, sweet berries that are often used in winemaking. The leaves are typically larger and more robust compared to other Vitis vinifera varieties. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
