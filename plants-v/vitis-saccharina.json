    "intro": "Vitis saccharina, commonly known as the sugar vine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis saccharina is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. It has been used historically by Native American tribes for its medicinal and culinary properties."
