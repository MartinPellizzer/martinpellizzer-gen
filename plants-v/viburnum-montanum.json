    "intro": "Viburnum montanum, commonly known as mountain viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded habitats and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring. These flowers give way to dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. Viburnum montanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
