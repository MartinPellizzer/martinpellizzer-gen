It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of nine leaflets per leaf, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by berries that are typically green when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Vitis enneaphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
