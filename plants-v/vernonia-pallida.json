    "intro": "Vernonia pallida, commonly known as pale Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its pale yellow to greenish flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, and the leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs. Vernonia pallida is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its ecological benefits to native pollinators."
