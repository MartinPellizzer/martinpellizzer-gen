    "intro": "Viburnum alternifolium, commonly known as the alternateleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum alternifolium prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and colorful fruit, which attract birds and add seasonal interest."
