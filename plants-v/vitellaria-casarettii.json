    "intro": "Vitellaria casarettii, commonly known as the shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Sahelian regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a nutrient-rich seed kernel. The kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and cooking. It plays an important ecological and economic role in the regions where it grows."
