    "intro": "Vachellia pennatula, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its long, drooping branches. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that attract various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which splits open to release the seeds. Vachellia pennatula is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
