    "intro": "Volutella aphylla, commonly known as the leafless volutella, is a unique species belonging to the family Volutellaceae. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, instead featuring a compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that are often covered in a sticky, gelatinous substance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Due to its specialized morphology and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
