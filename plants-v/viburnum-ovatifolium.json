It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically 3 to 6 inches long and have a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries in the fall. Viburnum ovatifolium thrives in partial to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and wildlife benefits."
