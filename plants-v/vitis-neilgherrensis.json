It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries. Vitis neilgherrensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist climates. It is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for cultivation."
