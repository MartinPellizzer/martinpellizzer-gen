    "intro": "Valeriana lecoqii, commonly known as the Lecoq's valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often strongly scented foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
