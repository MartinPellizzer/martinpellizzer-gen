    "intro": "Vigna lobatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and often lobed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to other members of the Vigna genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Vigna lobatifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving fertility for subsequent crops."
