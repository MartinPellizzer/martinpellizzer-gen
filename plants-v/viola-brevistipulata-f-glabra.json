    "intro": "Viola brevistipulata f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically shorter than those of the species, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive white or yellow marking at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its smooth, glabrous leaf surfaces distinguish it from other members of the viola family."
