    "intro": "Vriesea imperialis, commonly known as the imperial bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are highly ornamental and can last for several months. Vriesea imperialis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
