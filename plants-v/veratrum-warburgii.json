    "intro": "Veratrum warburgii, commonly known as the Western white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features tall, hollow, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often adorned with waxy, white to pale green flowers. The plant's leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant with both medicinal and poisonous properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
