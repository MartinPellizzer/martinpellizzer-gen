It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces non-toxic, white, berry-like fruits that are often eaten by birds. Viburnum sterile typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
