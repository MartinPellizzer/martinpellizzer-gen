    "intro": "Valeriana lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Valeriana lasiocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has mild medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
