    "intro": "Vaccinium thibautii, commonly known as the Thibaut's blueberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically a deep blue or purple color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
