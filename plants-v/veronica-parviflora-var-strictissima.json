    "intro": "Veronica parviflora var. strictissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to native plant collections."
