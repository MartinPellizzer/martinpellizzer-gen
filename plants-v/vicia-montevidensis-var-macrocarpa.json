It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and long, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and it is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
