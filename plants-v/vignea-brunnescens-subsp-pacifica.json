    "intro": "Vignea brunnescens subsp. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces hairy, spiny pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
