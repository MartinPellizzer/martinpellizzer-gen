    "intro": "Vaccinium sparsum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America. It thrives in sandy, acidic soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture and a dark green hue. Vaccinium sparsum plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal soils."
