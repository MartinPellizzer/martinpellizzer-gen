    "intro": "Vateria lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf vateria, is a tropical rainforest tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Vateria lanceifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, shaded environments within dense forest canopies."
