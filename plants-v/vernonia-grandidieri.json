    "intro": "Vernonia grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a rough texture, while its bark is thick and fissured. Vernonia grandidieri is adapted to the dry, arid conditions of its native habitat and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
