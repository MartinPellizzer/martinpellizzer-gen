It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, purple to pinkish-red composite flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variety is notable for its resinous secretions, which can be found on its stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
