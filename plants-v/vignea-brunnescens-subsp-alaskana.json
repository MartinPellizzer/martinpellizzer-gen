    "intro": "Vignea brunnescens subsp. alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska burrseed, is a flowering plant native to the northwestern United States and southern Canada. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as gravelly slopes and disturbed areas. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by distinctive burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
