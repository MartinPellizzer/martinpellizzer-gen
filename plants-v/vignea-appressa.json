    "intro": "Vignea appressa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vining plant, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, twining stems that ascend supports such as trellises or fences. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with several pairs of oval, pointed leaflets. Vignea appressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
