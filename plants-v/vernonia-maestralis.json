    "intro": "Vernonia maestralis, commonly known as the coastal ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, dark purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Vernonia maestralis thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
