    "intro": "Viburnum parvifolium, commonly known as the Pacific dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum parvifolium is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil."
