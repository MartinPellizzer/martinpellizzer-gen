    "intro": "Veratrum album subsp. lobelianum, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This species contains toxic alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine, though it requires careful handling due to its poisonous nature."
