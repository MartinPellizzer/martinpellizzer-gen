    "intro": "Vriesea monticola, commonly known as the mountain vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant features a rosette of broad, glossy leaves that are often green with red or purple markings. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange or yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer. Vriesea monticola is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for moderate light and its ability to thrive in humid environments."
