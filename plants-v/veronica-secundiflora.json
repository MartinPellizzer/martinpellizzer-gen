    "intro": "Veronica secundiflora, commonly known as desert speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Veronica secundiflora is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
