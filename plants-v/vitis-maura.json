It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Vitis maura is adaptable to various soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. It is also known for its vigorous growth and ability to climb using tendrils."
