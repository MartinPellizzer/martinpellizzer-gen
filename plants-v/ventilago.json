    "intro": "Ventilago, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants typically have heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and they produce showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. Ventilago species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
