It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions. Vernonia corcovadensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
