    "intro": "Vernonia hirsuta, commonly known as rough ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that give it its common name and help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Vernonia hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
