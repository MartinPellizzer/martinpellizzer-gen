    "intro": "Veronicastrum virginicum var. sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This variety is closely related to the native Veronicastrum virginicum but exhibits distinct morphological and genetic differences."
