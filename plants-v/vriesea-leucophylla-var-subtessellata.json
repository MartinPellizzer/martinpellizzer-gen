    "intro": "Vriesea leucophylla var. subtessellata, commonly known as the white-leafed vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, broad leaves that are predominantly white with green margins. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom from the base of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
