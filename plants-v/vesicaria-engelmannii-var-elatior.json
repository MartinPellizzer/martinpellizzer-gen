    "intro": "Vesicaria engelmannii var. elatior, commonly known as the Engelmann's bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain water in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and mountain slopes. Its unique bladder-like structures, which are modified leaves, are a distinctive botanical feature."
