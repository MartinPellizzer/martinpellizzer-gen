    "intro": "Veronica viscida, commonly known as sticky veronica, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
