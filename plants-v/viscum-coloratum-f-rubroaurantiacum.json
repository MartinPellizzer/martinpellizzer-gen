    "intro": "Viscum coloratum f. rubroaurantiacum, commonly known as the red-orange mistletoe, is a variant of the European mistletoe. It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and other broadleaf species. The plant's leaves are ovate and have a distinctive waxy coating, while its flowers are small and greenish-white. The fruit is a fleshy, red-orange berry that contains sticky seeds, aiding in its dispersal by birds. This form is notable for its vibrant coloration, which sets it apart from the more common green varieties of Viscum coloratum."
