    "intro": "Viola pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodland areas, often near pine trees, hence its common name. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white. Viola pinetorum is known for its ability to thrive in partial to full shade and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
