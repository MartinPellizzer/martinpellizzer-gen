    "intro": "Vernonia anisochaetoides, commonly known as the rough-hair Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, rough-hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, while the leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs. Vernonia anisochaetoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
