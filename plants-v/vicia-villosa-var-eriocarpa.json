    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. eriocarpa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white, followed by elongated, bean-shaped pods. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. Vicia villosa var. eriocarpa is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
