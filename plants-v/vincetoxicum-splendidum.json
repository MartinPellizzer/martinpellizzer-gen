    "intro": "Vincetoxicum splendidum, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a striking perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features showy, clusters of white flowers that transition into bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, dark green surface. Its berries are a preferred food source for birds, which help in seed dispersal. Vincetoxicum splendidum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
