    "intro": "Viola longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and parts of South America. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Viola longipes is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
