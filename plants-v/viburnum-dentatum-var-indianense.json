    "intro": "Viburnum dentatum var. indianense, commonly known as the Indian honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
