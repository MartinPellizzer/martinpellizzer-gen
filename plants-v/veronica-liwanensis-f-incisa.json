    "intro": "Veronica liwanensis f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a rare botanical species native to specific regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its unique morphological features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying endemic flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
