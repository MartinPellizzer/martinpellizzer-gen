It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a variety of soil types. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
