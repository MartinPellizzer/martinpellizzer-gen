It is a perennial herb that typically grows up to 60 centimeters tall, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.
