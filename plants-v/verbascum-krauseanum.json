    "intro": "Verbascum krauseanum, commonly known as the velvetleaf mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, upright stems covered in dense, soft, velvety hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. Verbascum krauseanum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands."
