    "intro": "Verbascum apiculatum, commonly known as the spiked mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and woodland edges. Verbascum apiculatum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and soothing effects."
