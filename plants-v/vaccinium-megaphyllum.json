    "intro": "Vaccinium megaphyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which eventually develop into dark blue, leathery berries. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
