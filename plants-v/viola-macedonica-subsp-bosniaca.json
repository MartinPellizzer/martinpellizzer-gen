It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate violet flowers with a distinctive yellow center. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller stature and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical V. macedonica."
