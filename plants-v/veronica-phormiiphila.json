    "intro": "Veronica phormiiphila, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Veronica phormiiphila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountain ecosystems."
