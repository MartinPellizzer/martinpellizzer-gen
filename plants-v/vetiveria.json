    "intro": "Vetiveria, commonly known as vetiver, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in height, and its rhizomes are extensively used in various applications. The plant is well adapted to heavy clay soils and is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system. Vetiveria species are also cultivated for their essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and resilience make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
