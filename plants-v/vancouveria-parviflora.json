    "intro": "Vancouveria parviflora, commonly known as the Vancouver fairybells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy coating, and its flowering stems bear clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are dispersed by birds. Vancouveria parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
