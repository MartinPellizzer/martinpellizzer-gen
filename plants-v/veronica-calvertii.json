    "intro": "Veronica calvertii, commonly known as Calvert's speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
