    "intro": "Veronica agrestis var. versicolor, commonly known as the meadow speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, arranged in whorls around the stems. This variety is noted for its variable flower colors, ranging from white to pink, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
