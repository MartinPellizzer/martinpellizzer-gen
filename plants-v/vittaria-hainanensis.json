    "intro": "Vittaria hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan spikeweed, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vittaria hainanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
