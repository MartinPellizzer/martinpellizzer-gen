    "intro": "Viburnum roseum, commonly known as the roseleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically pink-tinged when young and turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Viburnum roseum thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to landscape designs."
