    "intro": "Vochysia alternifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian cherry, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its bark is smooth and light brown, and it is often found in moist, lowland forests. Vochysia alternifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
