    "intro": "Vriesea joyae, commonly known as the Joya Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects water and nutrients. The plant produces tall flower spikes with showy, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea joyae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
