    "intro": "Vera-duthiea sebirii, commonly known as the Silverleaf Starbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and star-shaped, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices and mountainous terrains. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vera-duthiea sebirii is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
