    "intro": "Vriesea squamosa, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored inflorescence that resembles a flame, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central reservoir for collecting rainwater. Its flowers bloom in a spiral pattern along a central stem, often lasting for several weeks. Vriesea squamosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
