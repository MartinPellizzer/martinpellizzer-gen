    "intro": "Vochysia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian velvet tree, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Vochysia boliviana is typically found in humid tropical forests and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
