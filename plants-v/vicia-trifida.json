    "intro": "Vicia trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in early spring. Vicia trifida is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 60 cm tall, with hairy stems and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds."
