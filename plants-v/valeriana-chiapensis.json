    "intro": "Valeriana chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapan valerian, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Valeriana chiapensis is valued for its potential sedative and calming properties, similar to other species in the Valeriana genus."
