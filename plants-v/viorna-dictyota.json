    "intro": "Viorna dictyota, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its flat, blade-like structure and bright green color, which results from its high chlorophyll content. This plant thrives in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters where it forms dense mats on rocky substrates. Viorna dictyota plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important indicator of water quality in coastal regions."
