    "intro": "Viguiera subcanescens, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust growth habit. The plant features silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its showy, pinkish-purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera subcanescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
