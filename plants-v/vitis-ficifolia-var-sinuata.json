    "intro": "Vitis ficifolia var. sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous grapevines, is a variant of the Chinese grapevine species. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. Its vines can grow quite long, often reaching several meters in length, making it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside, adding to its aesthetic appeal."
