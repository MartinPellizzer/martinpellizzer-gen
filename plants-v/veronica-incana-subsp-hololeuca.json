    "intro": "Veronica incana subsp. hololeuca, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs, and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows and open slopes. Veronica incana subsp. hololeuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
