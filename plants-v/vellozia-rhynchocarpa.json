    "intro": "Vellozia rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the knobstick plant, is a unique member of the Velloziaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and sparse, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Vellozia rhynchocarpa is notable for its slow growth and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
