    "intro": "Viola cognata, commonly known as the nodding violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from purple to violet, often with a distinctive white or yellow mark near the base of the petals. Viola cognata typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a touch of color to the forest floor before its leaves fully develop."
