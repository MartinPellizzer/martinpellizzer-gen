    "intro": "Vulpia hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid vulpia, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing plant with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Vulpia hybrida thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. It is an important component of grassland ecosystems and can serve as a forage plant for certain livestock."
