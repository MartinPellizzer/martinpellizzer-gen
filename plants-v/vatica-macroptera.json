    "intro": "Vatica macroptera, commonly known as the large-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable timber. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a species of conservation concern."
