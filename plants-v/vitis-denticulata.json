    "intro": "Vitis denticulata, commonly known as the toothed grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, greenish-white berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Vitis denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
