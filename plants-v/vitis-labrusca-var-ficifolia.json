    "intro": "Vitis labrusca var. ficifolia, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Its berries, which are typically red or black, are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or walls."
