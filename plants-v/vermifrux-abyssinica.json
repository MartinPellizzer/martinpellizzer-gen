    "intro": "Vermifrux abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has silver-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic resin. Vermifrux abyssinica has been traditionally used in local medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
