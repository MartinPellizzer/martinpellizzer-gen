The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Vriesea gelatinosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
