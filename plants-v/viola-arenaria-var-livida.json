    "intro": "Viola arenaria var. livida, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish tinge, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet or blue, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or alpine themes."
