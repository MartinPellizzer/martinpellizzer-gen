    "intro": "Vincetoxicum salvinii, commonly known as the Salvin's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are usually pink or red. Vincetoxicum salvinii is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
