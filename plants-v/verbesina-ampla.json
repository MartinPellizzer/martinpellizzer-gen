    "intro": "Verbesina ampla, commonly known as the yellow beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with toothed edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Its seeds are encased in a bristly pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Verbesina ampla is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal use."
