    "intro": "Vittaria schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of rainforests. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of its leaves. Vittaria schliebenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
