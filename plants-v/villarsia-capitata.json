    "intro": "Villarsia capitata, commonly known as the Cape York hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Villarsia capitata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical climates."
