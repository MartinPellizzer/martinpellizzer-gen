    "intro": "Veronica tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Veronica tibetica is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
