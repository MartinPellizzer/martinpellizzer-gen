    "intro": "Virola cuspidata, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are alternate along the branches. The tree produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody, spiky fruits containing numerous seeds. Virola cuspidata is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and as a source of traditional medicine. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in the rainforest ecosystem."
