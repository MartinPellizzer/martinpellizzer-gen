    "intro": "Vitis labrusca var. catawba, commonly known as Catawba grape, is a North American vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically sweet and aromatic. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, green, and clustered in inflorescences. Catawba grapes are often used in winemaking due to their complex flavor profile and high sugar content. The vine is vigorous and can grow up to 30 feet long, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
