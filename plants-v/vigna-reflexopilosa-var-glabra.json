    "intro": "Vigna reflexopilosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cowpea, is a legume species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. The variety 'glabra' is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the stems and leaves, making it visually distinct from other variants."
