    "intro": "Vilfa alba, commonly known as the white vilfa, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a delicate, aromatic scent. Vilfa alba is often found in meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
