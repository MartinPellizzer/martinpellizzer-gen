    "intro": "Vicia mollis, commonly known as silky vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Vicia mollis is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
