It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple and violet. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is considered a species of conservation concern."
