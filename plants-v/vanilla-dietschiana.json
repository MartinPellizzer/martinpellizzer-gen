    "intro": "Vanilla dietschiana, commonly known as the Schott's vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It produces fragrant, vanilla-scented pods that are similar in appearance to the more well-known vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a warm climate with high rainfall. Its flowers are typically yellowish-green with a distinctive, spurred lip. The vanilla flavor of its pods is less intense compared to commercial vanilla, but it is still valued in some culinary and aromatic applications."
