    "intro": "Viola palustris proles herminii, commonly known as the purple marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive dark purple throat, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
