It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five lobes and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
