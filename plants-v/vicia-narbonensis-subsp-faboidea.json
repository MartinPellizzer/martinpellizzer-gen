    "intro": "Vicia narbonensis subsp. faboidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish-purple flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
