It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Valcarcelia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
