    "intro": "Verbascum cheiranthifolium var. pisidicum, commonly known as the Crimean mullein, is a perennial plant native to the southern regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often found in rocky or dry soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
