    "intro": "Vatica oblongifolia subsp. selakoensis, commonly known as the Selako ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage, which contributes to its ecological importance in forest ecosystems. The plant typically grows in lowland to hill forests, thriving in humid, warm climates. Its flowers are small and yellowish, clustered in panicles, while its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
