    "intro": "Vernonia senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its bark is thick and resistant to damage. Vernonia senegalensis is also valued for its hard wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
