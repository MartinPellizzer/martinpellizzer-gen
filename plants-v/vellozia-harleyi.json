It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. Vellozia harleyi is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
