    "intro": "Veronica teucrium var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, upright stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, giving the plant its common name, and it prefers well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded locations. It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. This variety is closely related to other members of the Veronica genus, which are known for their showy, clustered flowers."
