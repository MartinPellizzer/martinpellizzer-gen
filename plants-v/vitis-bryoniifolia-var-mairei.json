    "intro": "Vitis bryoniifolia var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's grapevine, is a rare and distinctive plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically followed by clusters of small, round berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
