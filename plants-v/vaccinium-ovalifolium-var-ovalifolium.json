    "intro": "Vaccinium ovalifolium var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the ovalleaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
