    "intro": "Vitis cavicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grapevine, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that give way to red to black berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems and have a distinctive, narrow shape. Vitis cavicaulis is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
