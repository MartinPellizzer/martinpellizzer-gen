    "intro": "Vochysia venulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or velvetwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Vochysia venulosa is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in musical instruments and furniture, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting."
