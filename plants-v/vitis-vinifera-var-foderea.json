    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. foderea, commonly known as the Fodera grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, dark-colored berries and is primarily grown in specific regions of Italy. The plant exhibits typical viticultural features, including vigorous growth and a tendency to produce clusters of fruit. Its botanical traits make it suitable for niche wine production and historical cultivation. However, it is not widely cultivated today due to its limited yield and specific climatic requirements."
