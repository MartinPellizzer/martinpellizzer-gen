    "intro": "Vallea, commonly known as the \"wild bean\" or \"vallea vine,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. The leaves are typically pinnate, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Flowers are usually small and clustered, often in racemes, with pea-like blooms that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces leguminous pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
