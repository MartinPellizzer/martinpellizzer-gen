    "intro": "Vicia grandiflora var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
