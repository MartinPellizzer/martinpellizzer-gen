    "intro": "Vernonia patens, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that produces clusters of small, blue-gray flowers, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its showy blooms and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to pollinator-friendly landscapes."
