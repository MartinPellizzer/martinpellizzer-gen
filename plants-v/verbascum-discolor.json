    "intro": "Verbascum discolor, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Verbascum discolor thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry habitats. Its fibrous leaves and stems have been historically used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
