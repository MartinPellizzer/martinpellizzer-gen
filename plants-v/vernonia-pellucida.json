    "intro": "Vernonia pellucida, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Vernonia pellucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
