    "intro": "Vulpia myuros var. broteri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vulpia, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This species is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in environments with moderate moisture levels."
