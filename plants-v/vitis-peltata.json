    "intro": "Vitis peltata, commonly known as the creeping grape or wild grape, is a deciduous vine native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are typically red or black when mature. Vitis peltata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its flexible stems allow it to climb or trail along the ground, making it adaptable to various habitats."
