    "intro": "Vernonia gigantea subsp. ovalifolia, commonly known as the giant ironweed, is a striking perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its fibrous roots make it drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping. The subspecies ovalifolia is distinguished by its oval-shaped leaves, which set it apart from other Vernonia species."
