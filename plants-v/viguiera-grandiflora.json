    "intro": "Viguiera grandiflora, commonly known as Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant features tall, erect stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its showy, pink to purple flower heads appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Viguiera grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
