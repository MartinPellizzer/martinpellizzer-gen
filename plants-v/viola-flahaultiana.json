    "intro": "Viola flahaultiana, commonly known as the Flahault's violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Viola flahaultiana is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
