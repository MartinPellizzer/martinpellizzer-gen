    "intro": "Verbena forsskalii, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring compact, branching stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of violet, blue, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Verbena forsskalii is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in semi-arid climates."
