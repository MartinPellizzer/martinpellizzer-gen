    "intro": "Vismia rufescens var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf vismia, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
