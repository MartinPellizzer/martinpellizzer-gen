    "intro": "Vitis sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arrow-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of berries that range in color from green to black. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found along streambanks and in shaded areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
