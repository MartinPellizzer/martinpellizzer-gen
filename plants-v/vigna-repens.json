    "intro": "Vigna repens, commonly known as the prostrate cowpea, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in a sprawling, vine-like manner, often reaching lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds. Vigna repens is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial cover crop."
