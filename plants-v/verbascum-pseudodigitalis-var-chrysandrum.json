It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its common name reflects the golden hue of its blooms and its resemblance to the traditional mullein plant."
