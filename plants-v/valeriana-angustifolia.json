    "intro": "Valeriana angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Valeriana angustifolia is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
