    "intro": "Veronica persica var. aschersoniana, commonly known as Persian speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from spring to early summer."
