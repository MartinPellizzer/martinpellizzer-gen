It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is known for its toxic sap, which can be harmful to livestock and humans. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a concern in some regions."
