    "intro": "Veratrum album var. spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
