    "intro": "Vicia sericocarpa subsp. mardinica, commonly known as the Mardin vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods that contain several seeds, a feature typical of the Vicia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
