    "intro": "Vriesea rodigasiana, commonly known as the Dragon's Head Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height, topped with a vibrant red or orange flower. The plant's rosette of sword-shaped leaves is covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help collect and store water. Vriesea rodigasiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is popular in horticulture for its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
