    "intro": "Vanda brunnea, commonly known as the golden vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange. Vanda brunnea typically has long, slender pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves. It requires bright light and well-draining substrates to thrive in cultivation."
