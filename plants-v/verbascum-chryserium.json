    "intro": "Verbascum chryserium, commonly known as the golden mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a raceme at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Verbascum chryserium is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects."
