    "intro": "Viola arborea, commonly known as the tree violet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, forming a small tree-like structure. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical features include showy, spurred petals and a distinctive scent that attracts pollinators. Viola arborea is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
