    "intro": "Vandellia angustifolia f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered vandellia, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key feature in orchid identification. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soils for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
