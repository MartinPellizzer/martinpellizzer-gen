It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. Viscum species are found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere. The plant absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its berries are often associated with holiday traditions, particularly in Christmas celebrations."
