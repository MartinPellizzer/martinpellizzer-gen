    "intro": "Vitex compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, blue to purple flowers in the summer, which are followed by narrow, woody fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Vitex compressa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
