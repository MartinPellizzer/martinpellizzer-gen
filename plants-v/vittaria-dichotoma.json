    "intro": "Vittaria dichotoma, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow in a rosette-like pattern. The plant's leaves are typically divided into two main branches, giving it the common name \"forked fern.\" It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Vittaria dichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
