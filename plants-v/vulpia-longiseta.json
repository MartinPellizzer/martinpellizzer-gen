    "intro": "Vulpia longiseta, commonly known as the long-haired fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are often covered with fine, bristly hairs, which give it its common name. Vulpia longiseta is adapted to temperate climates and can tolerate a range of soil conditions."
