    "intro": "Valantia bauhini, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a tropical plant native to Central and South America, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm, humid environments. Valantia bauhini is often found in moist, shaded areas such as undergrowth in tropical forests. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological impact as an invasive species in some regions is a concern."
