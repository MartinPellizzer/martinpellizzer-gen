    "intro": "Victoria cruziana f. mattogrossensis, commonly known as the Amazon water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant features showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that repels water, allowing the plant to float on the water's surface. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to the nutrient cycle."
