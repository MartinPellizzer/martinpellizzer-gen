    "intro": "Viburnum villosum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring arching branches and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue that turns reddish in the fall. Its fruit is a dark blue to black drupe, which attracts birds and is an important food source in the ecosystem. This plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
