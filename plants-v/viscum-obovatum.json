    "intro": "Viscum obovatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees such as oaks and apple trees. It has a distinctive appearance with glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Viscum obovatum relies on birds for seed dispersal, as the berries are eaten and the seeds are excreted in new locations. It plays an important ecological role in supporting certain bird species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
