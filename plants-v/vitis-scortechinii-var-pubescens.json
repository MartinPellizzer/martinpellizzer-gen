    "intro": "Vitis scortechinii var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent grapevine, is a lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its botanical variant name. Native to parts of Asia, particularly China, this plant typically grows in moist, forested environments. The leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, clustered berries. Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant diversity."
