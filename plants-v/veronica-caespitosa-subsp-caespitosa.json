    "intro": "Veronica caespitosa subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its flowers are typically arranged in whorls along the stems, and the species is known for its ability to tolerate partial shade. The subspecies caespitosa is distinguished by its compact growth habit and its native range within the western regions of North America."
