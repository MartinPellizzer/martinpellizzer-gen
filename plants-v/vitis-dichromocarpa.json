    "intro": "Vitis dichromocarpa, commonly known as the two-colored grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive two-colored leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and bluish-gray on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis dichromocarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
