It features large, velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its cultivation in horticultural settings."
