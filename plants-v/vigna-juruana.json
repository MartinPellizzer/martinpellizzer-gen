It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to pod fruits containing edible seeds. Vigna juruana is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional cuisine and for their nutritional content. It also has potential in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
