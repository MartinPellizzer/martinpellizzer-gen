    "intro": "Verbascum cinereum, commonly known as gray mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a terminal spike. Its leaves and flowers contain mucilage, which has been historically used to soothe respiratory conditions. Verbascum cinereum thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
