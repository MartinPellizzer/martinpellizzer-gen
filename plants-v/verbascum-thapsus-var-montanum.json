    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus var. montanum, commonly known as mountain mullein, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features large, velvety grey-green leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in dense hairs. The plant produces tall, upright stems bearing yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its fibrous roots and hairy leaves help it retain moisture in harsh, arid conditions."
