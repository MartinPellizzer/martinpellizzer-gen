    "intro": "Viscum myriophlebium, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a spongy, white, absorptive tissue. The plant produces small, green, scale-like leaves and white, fleshy berries that are toxic to many animals. It is native to South America and is often found in humid, temperate forests. Its ecological role includes providing food for certain birds and contributing to the decomposition of host trees."
