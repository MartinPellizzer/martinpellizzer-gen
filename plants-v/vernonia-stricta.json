It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas. Its tall, slender stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance. The showy purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
