    "intro": "Vitis rufula, commonly known as the red sandalwood grape, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis rufula is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural research."
