    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum f. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a variant of the common blueberry, characterized by its smaller, more compact leaves and berries. The plant thrives in acidic, peat-rich soils and is often found in bogs and fens. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the berries are small, tart, and edible. This form is well adapted to moist, nutrient-poor environments, making it an important component of its ecological community."
