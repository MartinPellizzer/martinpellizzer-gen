    "intro": "Veronicastrum stenostachyum, commonly known as blue mist spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its showy, blue-violet flower clusters that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Veronicastrum stenostachyum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
