    "intro": "Vicia bipartita, commonly known as the two-lobed vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its seeds are encased in a pod and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Vicia bipartita is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
