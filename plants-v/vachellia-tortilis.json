    "intro": "Vachellia tortilis, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a hardy, drought-resistant shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown of thorny branches and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like stems that perform photosynthesis, reducing water loss. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Vachellia tortilis plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
