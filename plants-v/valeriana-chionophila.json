    "intro": "Valeriana chionophila, commonly known as the snow valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, hairy stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces numerous tiny, spherical fruits known as caryopses, which are dispersed by wind. Valeriana chionophila thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has mild medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
