    "intro": "Vaccinium scyphocalyx, commonly known as the panicle blueberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. The fruit is a small, blue-black berry that ripens in late summer and is edible, though often used more for ornamental purposes than for consumption."
