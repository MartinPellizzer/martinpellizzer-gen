    "intro": "Viscum album var. rubroaurantiacum, commonly known as the red-orange mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish-orange, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that are a key part of its reproductive cycle. Its twining stems and specialized roots allow it to attach to and draw nutrients from its host. This variety is notable for its striking coloration and is often used in festive decorations, though it contains toxic compounds."
