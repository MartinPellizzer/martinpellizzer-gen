    "intro": "Vanilla francoisii, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by the characteristic vanilla pods. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with partial shade and well-drained soil. Its vanilla pods are harvested when they turn yellow and are then cured and dried to develop their aromatic flavor. This species is highly valued for its unique and intense vanilla aroma, making it a sought-after ingredient in perfumes and culinary applications."
