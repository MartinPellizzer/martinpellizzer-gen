    "intro": "Virginea, commonly known as the Virgin's veil, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Virginea is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
