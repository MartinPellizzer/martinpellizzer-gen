    "intro": "Viola palmata var. esculenta, commonly known as the edible violet, is a cultivar of the common violet that is prized for its edible flowers and leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by heart-shaped leaves and clusters of purple or violet flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its flowers are often used in culinary applications, adding a delicate flavor to dishes and beverages. The leaves, while less commonly consumed, can also be used in cooking, though they should be prepared carefully to avoid bitterness."
