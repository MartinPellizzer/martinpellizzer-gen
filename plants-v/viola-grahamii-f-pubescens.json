    "intro": "Viola grahamii f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent violet, is a rare and distinctive variant of the viola genus. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves and stems, which give it a unique texture compared to typical viola species. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, often with a yellow or white center. Native to specific regions in the western United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
