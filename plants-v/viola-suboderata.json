    "intro": "Viola suboderata, commonly known as the lesser violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The flowers typically have five petals, with the lower petal often featuring a distinctive yellow or white marking. Viola suboderata is often found growing in clusters, and its leaves are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal."
