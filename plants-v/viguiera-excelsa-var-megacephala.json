    "intro": "Viguiera excelsa var. megacephala, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, purple to pinkish-red flowers. The plant produces yellowish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Viguiera excelsa var. megacephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
