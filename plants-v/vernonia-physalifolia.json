    "intro": "Vernonia physalifolia, commonly known as the globe globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical seed heads, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
