    "intro": "Valeriana graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered valerian, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in high-altitude grasslands and forest understories. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are fibrous and contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. Valeriana graciliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
