    "intro": "Vulcanoa steyermarkii, commonly known as the Sierra Leone wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Vulcanoa steyermarkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and resilience."
