    "intro": "Vitis geniculata, commonly known as the creeping grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, twisting stems that can climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. Vitis geniculata is often found in moist woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
