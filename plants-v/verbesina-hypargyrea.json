    "intro": "Verbesina hypargyrea, commonly known as the silverleaf beggar-ticks, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae and is known for its creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats. Its stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and it produces small, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Verbesina hypargyrea is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
