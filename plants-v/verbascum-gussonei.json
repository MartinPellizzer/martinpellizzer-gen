    "intro": "Verbascum gussonei, commonly known as the Sicilian mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum gussonei is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
