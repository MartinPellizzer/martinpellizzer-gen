    "intro": "Vernonia puncticulata, commonly known as the dotted ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with distinctive white dots, and its flowers range from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Vernonia puncticulata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
