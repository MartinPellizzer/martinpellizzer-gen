    "intro": "Vexillabium integrum, commonly known as the complete banner plant, is a rare and distinctive species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring large, showy, banner-like petals that resemble a flag. The plant belongs to the family Violaceae and is known for its striking violet-blue coloration. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a velvety texture that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vexillabium integrum is considered a conservation concern."
