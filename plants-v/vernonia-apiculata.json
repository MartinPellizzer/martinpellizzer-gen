    "intro": "Vernonia apiculata, commonly known as the purpletop vervain, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple to violet flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia apiculata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
