    "intro": "Viburnum ciliatum, commonly known as the fragrant snowball bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves emerge. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Viburnum ciliatum thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and wildlife benefits."
