It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, spirally twisted leaves that give it its common name. Its fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Virectaria heteromera is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
