    "intro": "Vernonia subpaludosa, commonly known as swamp ironweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Vernonia subpaludosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
