It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a pale green underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of small, yellowish fruits. Vitis pallida is often found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a unique species within the Vitaceae family."
