    "intro": "Vernonia moramballae, commonly known as the Moramballa ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Its bright yellow to orange flower heads are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Vernonia moramballae is of interest to botanists due to its endemic status and potential ecological significance in its native environment."
