    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with distinctive red and green markings, and its long, slender pods that contain several small, bean-like seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. It has a climbing habit, using its tendrils to ascend supports, and produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
