    "intro": "Vanilla africana var. gilletii, commonly known as the African vanilla or the West African vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical Africa. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's most notable feature is its long, fleshy, greenish-black pods, which contain the aromatic vanilla seeds used in flavoring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its unique aroma and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical and culinary contexts."
