    "intro": "Vicia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the colder regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in early summer. Vicia sibirica has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility."
