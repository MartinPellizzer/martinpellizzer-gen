    "intro": "Vincetoxicum laxum, commonly known as the slender greenbriar, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly serrated margin. Vincetoxicum laxum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
