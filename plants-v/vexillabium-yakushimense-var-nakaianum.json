    "intro": "Vexillabium yakushimense var. nakaianum, commonly known as the Yakushima bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the subtropical forests of Yakushima Island in Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
