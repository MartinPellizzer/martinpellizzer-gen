    "intro": "Vittaria interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features delicate, linear fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive interrupted pattern. Vittaria interrupta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
