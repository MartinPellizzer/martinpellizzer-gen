    "intro": "Vandopsis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes vandopsis, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small but striking, often displaying vivid colors and intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vandopsis celebica is considered a conservation concern."
