    "intro": "Verbena stoechadifolia, commonly known as sea verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Sea verbena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
