    "intro": "Vitis polita, commonly known as the smooth grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to eastern North America, particularly the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often waxy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruits are small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. Vitis polita is often found growing along stream banks and in moist woodlands, where it can climb trees or spread along the ground."
