    "intro": "Vulpia ligustica var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, greenish-brown florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its resilience, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
