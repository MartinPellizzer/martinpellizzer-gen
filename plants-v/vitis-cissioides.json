    "intro": "Vitis cissioides, commonly known as the creeping grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 3-5 inches in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in the fall. Its stems are covered in tendrils that allow it to climb and spread along the ground. Vitis cissioides is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife benefits."
