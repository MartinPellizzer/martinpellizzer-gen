    "intro": "Viscum laxum var. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its sticky seeds. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its pale green to white foliage. The plant derives most of its nutrients from its host, while photosynthesis occurs to a lesser extent. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. This variant is less common than the typical Viscum laxum and is often found in temperate regions."
