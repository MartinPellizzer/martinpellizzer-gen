    "intro": "Viscum articulatum, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its life cycle includes a dormant phase where the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the berries. Viscum articulatum is often found in temperate regions and is notable for its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
