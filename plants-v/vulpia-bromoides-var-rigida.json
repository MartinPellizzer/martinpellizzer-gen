    "intro": "Vulpia bromoides var. rigida, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
