    "intro": "Vellozia goiasensis, commonly known as the Goi\u00e1s vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Velloziaceae and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent foliage. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from yellow to red. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
