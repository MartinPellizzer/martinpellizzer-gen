It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered berries that are typically dark purple in color. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. It is noted for its ornamental value, with attractive foliage and potential for use in ornamental horticulture. However, due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is not widely available for commercial cultivation."
