It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in restoration projects."
