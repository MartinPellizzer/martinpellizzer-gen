    "intro": "Valerianella samolifolia, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Valerianella samolifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
