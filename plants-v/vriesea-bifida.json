    "intro": "Vriesea bifida, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that emerges from the center of the leaf rosette. Vriesea bifida thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
