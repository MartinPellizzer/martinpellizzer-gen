    "intro": "Vitis obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, dark blue berries. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and grows as a vine with tendrils that allow it to climb. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The berries are edible but are not as widely cultivated as other grape species."
