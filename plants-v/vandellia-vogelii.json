    "intro": "Vandellia vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's vandellia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that help it store water in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vandellia vogelii is considered an endangered species."
