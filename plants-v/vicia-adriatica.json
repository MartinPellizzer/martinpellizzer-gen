    "intro": "Vicia adriatica, commonly known as Adriatic vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. Vicia adriatica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
