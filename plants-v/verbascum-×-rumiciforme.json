    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 rumiciforme, commonly known as the common mullein, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Verbascum \u00d7 rumiciforme is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
