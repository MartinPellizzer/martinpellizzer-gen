    "intro": "Verbesina oncophora, commonly known as the yellow beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems that bear small, bract-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Verbesina oncophora is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
