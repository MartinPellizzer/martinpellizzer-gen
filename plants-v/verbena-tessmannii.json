    "intro": "Verbena tessmannii, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its ability to survive in low-water environments makes it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
