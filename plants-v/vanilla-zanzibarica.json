    "intro": "Vanilla zanzibarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of East Africa. It produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found only in its native habitat. The plant is renowned for its rich, aromatic vanilla flavor, which is harvested from its seed pods after they mature. Its botanical characteristics include heart-shaped leaves and a complex reproductive system that relies on mutualistic relationships with its pollinators. Due to its limited natural range and specific ecological requirements, Vanilla zanzibarica is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
