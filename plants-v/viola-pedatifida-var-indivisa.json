    "intro": "Viola pedatifida var. indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive, narrow lobing that sets it apart from other viola species. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of violet or purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and early spring flowering."
