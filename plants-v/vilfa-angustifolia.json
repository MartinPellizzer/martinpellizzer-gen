It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural conditions."
