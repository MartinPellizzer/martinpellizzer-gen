It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy leaves that resemble those of the common mullein. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
