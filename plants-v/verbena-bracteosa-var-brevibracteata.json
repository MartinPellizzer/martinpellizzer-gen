    "intro": "Verbena bracteosa var. brevibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The plant's compact growth habit and long blooming period make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
