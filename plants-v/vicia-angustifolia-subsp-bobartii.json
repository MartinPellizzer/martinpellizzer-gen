    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia subsp. bobartii, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive narrow shape and small, pea-like flowers that range from yellow to reddish-purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
