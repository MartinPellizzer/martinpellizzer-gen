It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are broad and floating, with specialized structures for capturing prey. The species is known for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients."
