    "intro": "Vanilla \u00d7 hirsuta, commonly known as hairy vanilla, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from Vanilla planifolia and Vanilla torrei. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. Its vanilla pods, though less commercially cultivated than standard vanilla, are used in small-scale flavoring applications. This species is native to Mexico and is valued for its ornamental and aromatic qualities."
