    "intro": "Vignea praecox, commonly known as the early bean or dwarf bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Vignea praecox is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein and fiber. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate for optimal growth."
