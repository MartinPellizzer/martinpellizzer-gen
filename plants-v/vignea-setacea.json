    "intro": "Vignea setacea, commonly known as the hairy beggar-tick, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters, and it produces small, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Vignea setacea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some regions."
