    "intro": "Viburnum lantana, commonly known as the common snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
