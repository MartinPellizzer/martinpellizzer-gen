    "intro": "Vaccaria, commonly known as sandspur, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cistaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and produces small, spiny fruits called achene, which contain a single seed. Vaccaria is typically found in sandy or disturbed soils and is native to regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
