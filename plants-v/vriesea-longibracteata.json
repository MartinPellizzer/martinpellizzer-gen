    "intro": "Vriesea longibracteata, commonly known as the longibracteata bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, water-storing layer of trichomes. The plant produces an inflorescence that typically consists of a single, colorful flower surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually dark green with a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Vriesea longibracteata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions."
