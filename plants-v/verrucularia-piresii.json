    "intro": "Verrucularia piresii, commonly known as the Pires'\u75a3\u82d4, is a rare and specialized liverwort species belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth form and distinctive,\u75a3\u72b6 (wart-like) structures on its thallus, which give it its scientific name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its morphology includes a leafy structure with a complex arrangement of leaf cells, and it is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
