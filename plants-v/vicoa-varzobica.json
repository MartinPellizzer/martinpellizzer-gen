    "intro": "Vicoa varzobica, commonly known as the Zobian violet, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet petals and compact, rosette-like foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
