    "intro": "Vignea salina, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and arid regions with high salt content in the soil. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and salt accumulation. Its flowers are typically greenish or yellowish, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Vignea salina plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
