    "intro": "Viburnum orientale, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by striking, violet-pink berries that ripen in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and some domestic animals. Viburnum orientale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
