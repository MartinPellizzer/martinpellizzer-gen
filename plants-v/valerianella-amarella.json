    "intro": "Valerianella amarella, commonly known as dwarf valerian, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Valerianella amarella is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine."
