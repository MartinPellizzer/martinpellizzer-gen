    "intro": "Verbascum saxatile, commonly known as the saxatile mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, grey-green leaves that are often covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, terminal inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Verbascum saxatile is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its soothing properties."
