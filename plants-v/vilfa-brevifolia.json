    "intro": "Vilfa brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved vilfa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in areas with cool, temperate climates. The plant features compact, upright stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of white or pale blue, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Vilfa brevifolia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its ornamental appeal."
