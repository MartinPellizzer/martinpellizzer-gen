    "intro": "Verbena lancifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscapes. Verbena lancifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
