    "intro": "Vateria zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been historically valued for its timber and essential oils."
