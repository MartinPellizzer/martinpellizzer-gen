    "intro": "Verena, commonly known as heartleaf or verena herb, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Verena hirsuta and Verena lyrata, which are native to Europe and western Asia. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems and small, often heart-shaped leaves. They produce blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Verena species are often used in traditional medicine and are also cultivated as ornamental plants in gardens."
