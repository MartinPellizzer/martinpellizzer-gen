It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of violet, purple, or blue, depending on the cultivar. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
