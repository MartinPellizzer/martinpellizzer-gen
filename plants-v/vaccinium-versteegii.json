It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
