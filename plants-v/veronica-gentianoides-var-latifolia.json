    "intro": "Veronica gentianoides var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often broader than those of the typical variety, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and ecologically valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
