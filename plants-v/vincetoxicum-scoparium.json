    "intro": "Vincetoxicum scoparium, commonly known as the creeping beautyberry, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, followed by showy, dark purple to black berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The berries are toxic to humans and livestock, making it a plant with both ornamental and cautionary value in gardens."
