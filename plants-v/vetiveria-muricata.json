    "intro": "Vetiveria muricata, commonly known as the hairy vetiver, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fibrous roots that are highly valued for soil stabilization. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vetiveria muricata is also cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of natural fibers."
