    "intro": "Vincetoxicum stenanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
