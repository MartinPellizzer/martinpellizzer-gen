    "intro": "Vaccinium myrtilloides var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf blueberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, dark blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun for optimal growth. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential as a food source for wildlife and humans."
