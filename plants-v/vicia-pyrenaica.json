    "intro": "Vicia pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Vicia pyrenaica is adapted to rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open habitats like grasslands and shrublands. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
