    "intro": "Veltheimia undulata, commonly known as the zigzag veltheimia, is a striking evergreen bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces upright, grass-like flower stalks that bear small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Veltheimia undulata is relatively low maintenance and blooms reliably in late spring to early summer."
