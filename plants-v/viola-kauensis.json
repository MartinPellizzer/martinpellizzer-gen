    "intro": "Viola kauensis, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Kaua\u02bbi. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its small, tubular flowers are adapted for pollination by native bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola kauensis is considered a vulnerable species."
