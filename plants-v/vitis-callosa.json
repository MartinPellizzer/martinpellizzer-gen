It is characterized by its distinctive scaly bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis callosa is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
