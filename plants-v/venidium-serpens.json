    "intro": "Venidium serpens, commonly known as the creeping venidium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
