    "intro": "Viola gracillima var. incisa, commonly known as the slender violet, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping habit with hairy stems and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
