    "intro": "Verbena urticifolia var. riparia, commonly known as river verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams and riverbanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
