    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. pseudocracca, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range from white to purple. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Vicia villosa var. pseudocracca is also used as a cover crop and forage plant in agricultural settings."
