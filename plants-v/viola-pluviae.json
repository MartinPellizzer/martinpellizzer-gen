    "intro": "Viola pluviae, commonly known as the rain viola, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Viola pluviae is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
