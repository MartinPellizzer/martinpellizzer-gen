    "intro": "Viburnum congestum, commonly known as the clustered viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dense clusters of white flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but not recommended for human consumption. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Viburnum congestum thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
