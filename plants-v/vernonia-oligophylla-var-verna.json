It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and dry prairies. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
