    "intro": "Vaccinium tenellum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or dark purple in color, rich in antioxidants and nutrients. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil, often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. Its leaves are evergreen, narrow, and densely packed, contributing to its hardy nature. Vaccinium tenellum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and small mammals, by providing food and shelter."
