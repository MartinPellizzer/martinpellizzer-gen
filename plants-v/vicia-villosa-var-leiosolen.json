    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. leiosolen, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by elongated, bean-shaped pods containing several seeds. The plant is notable for its dense foliage and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable cover crop. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
