    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 mixtum subsp. wirtgenii, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, woolly leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Its common name reflects its resemblance to the traditional mullein plant, Verbascum blattaria."
