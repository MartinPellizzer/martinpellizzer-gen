    "intro": "Vignea stipata, commonly known as the stippled vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive stippled pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vignea stipata thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits."
