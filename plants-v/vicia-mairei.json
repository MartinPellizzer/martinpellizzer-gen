    "intro": "Vicia mairei, commonly known as the Maire vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine environments. Vicia mairei plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
