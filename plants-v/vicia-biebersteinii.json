    "intro": "Vicia biebersteinii, commonly known as the Siberian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and rocky habitats. Vicia biebersteinii plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
