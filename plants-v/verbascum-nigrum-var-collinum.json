    "intro": "Verbascum nigrum var. collinum, commonly known as the black mullein, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. The leaves and flowers have been used historically for their medicinal properties, including their soothing effects on respiratory conditions."
