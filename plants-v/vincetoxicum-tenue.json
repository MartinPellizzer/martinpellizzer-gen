    "intro": "Vincetoxicum tenue, commonly known as slender false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinct veining pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are slender and often trailing, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Vincetoxicum tenue is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes."
