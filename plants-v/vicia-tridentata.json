    "intro": "Vicia tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Vicia tridentata is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
