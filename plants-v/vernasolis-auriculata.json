    "intro": "Vernasolis auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped vernal flower, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, auricle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Vernasolis auriculata is a short-lived perennial that blooms in early spring, making it an early indicator of the changing seasons."
