    "intro": "Vaccinium papulosum, commonly known as the rough bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other Vaccinium species. Its leaves are oval and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its common name. Vaccinium papulosum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions."
