    "intro": "Vaccinium vitis-idaea f. minus, commonly known as the lesser cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to boreal and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are edible but often tart. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with ample sunlight. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and it is adapted to cold climates with a long growing season. This form is smaller than the typical Vaccinium vitis-idaea, making it a distinctive variant in its habitat."
