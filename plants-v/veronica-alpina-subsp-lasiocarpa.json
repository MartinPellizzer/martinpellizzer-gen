    "intro": "Veronica alpina subsp. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its cold, arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its subspecies-specific characteristics, such as the dense, woolly hairs on its stems, distinguish it from other Veronica species."
