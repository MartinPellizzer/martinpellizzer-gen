It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slender petiole. This species is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts."
