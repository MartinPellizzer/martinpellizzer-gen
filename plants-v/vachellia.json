    "intro": "Vachellia, commonly known as umbrella thorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Asia, and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, often yellow or white flowers. Many species of Vachellia are drought-tolerant, making them well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The genus includes several species that are important for both ecological and economic purposes, such as providing fodder for livestock and serving as a source of timber. Some species also have medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
