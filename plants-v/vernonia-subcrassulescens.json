    "intro": "Vernonia subcrassulescens, commonly known as the rough vernonia, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its leaves are generally rough and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Vernonia subcrassulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
