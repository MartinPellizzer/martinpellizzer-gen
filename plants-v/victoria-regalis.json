    "intro": "Victoria regalis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still waters. The plant's most notable feature is its showy, white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. Victoria regalis thrives in warm, sunny environments with clear, nutrient-rich water. Its unique structure and beauty make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and ponds."
