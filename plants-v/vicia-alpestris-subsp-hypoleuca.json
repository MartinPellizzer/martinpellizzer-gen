    "intro": "Vicia alpestris subsp. hypoleuca, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or white, which bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects. This subspecies is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
