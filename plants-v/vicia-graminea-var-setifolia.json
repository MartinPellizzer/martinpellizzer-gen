    "intro": "Vicia graminea var. setifolia, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are trifoliate with narrow, linear leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by slender, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a cover crop."
