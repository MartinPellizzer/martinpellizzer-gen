    "intro": "Vitis diepenhorstii, commonly known as Diepenhorst's grape, is a rare and critically endangered species native to South Africa. It is a climbing vine with compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature. It thrives in specific microhabitats, such as rocky outcrops and sandstone formations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
