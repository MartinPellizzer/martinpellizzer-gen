    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 tekirovense, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattarioides. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant features large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help to retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Verbascum \u00d7 tekirovense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sunlight."
