    "intro": "Vriesea irazuensis, commonly known as the Irazu bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Costa Rica. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can last for several months. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small ecosystem within the plant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea irazuensis is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
