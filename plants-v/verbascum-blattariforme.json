    "intro": "Verbascum blattariforme, commonly known as the broadleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical spike. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered with a thick layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
