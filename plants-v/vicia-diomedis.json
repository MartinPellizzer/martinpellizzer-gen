    "intro": "Vicia diomedis, commonly known as the Persian vetch, is a flowering plant species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and its pods contain several seeds. Vicia diomedis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. It is also occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance."
