    "intro": "Vicia stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Vicia stenophylla is a perennial herb that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with hairy stems and pods that contain several seeds. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
