    "intro": "Veronica bullii, commonly known as the Bull's-eye speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, with five petals and a distinctive white or yellow spot at the base of each petal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Veronica bullii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade."
