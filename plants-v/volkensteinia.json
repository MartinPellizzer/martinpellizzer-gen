    "intro": "Volkensteinia, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Ericaceae family. These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with acidic soils. They are characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors. Volkensteinia species are well adapted to harsh mountain climates, with some species exhibiting a cushion-like growth form to protect against wind and freezing temperatures. Their botanical features make them important components of high-altitude ecosystems."
