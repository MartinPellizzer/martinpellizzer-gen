    "intro": "Vanda tricolor var. cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon vanda, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, three-colored flowers that typically display shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The orchid produces fragrant blooms that can last several weeks, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
