    "intro": "Viburnum hispidulum, commonly known as roughleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are rough to the touch due to their stiff, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries in the fall. Viburnum hispidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
