    "intro": "Vicia helvetica, commonly known as the yellow sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and disturbed soils. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Vicia helvetica is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
