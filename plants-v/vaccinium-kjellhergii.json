    "intro": "Vaccinium kjellhergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of northern Europe. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Vaccinium kjellhergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
