    "intro": "Vaccinium trichocladum, commonly known as the red-berried huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant features small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its berries are typically red or black when mature and are edible, though they are often used in local culinary traditions. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas."
