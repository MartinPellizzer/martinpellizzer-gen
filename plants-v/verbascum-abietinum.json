    "intro": "Verbascum abietinum, commonly known as the mountain mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, soft pubescence. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Verbascum abietinum is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing and anti-inflammatory effects."
