    "intro": "Viola lobata var. lobata, commonly known as the Pacific violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, often in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
