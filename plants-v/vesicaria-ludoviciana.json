    "intro": "Vesicaria ludoviciana, commonly known as the western prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Vesicaria ludoviciana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
