    "intro": "Vantanea compacta subsp. compacta, commonly known as the compact vantanea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, rounded growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its compact form and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
