    "intro": "Vernonia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant features grayish-white, woolly hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow to brown flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia tomentella is often found in open woods, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
