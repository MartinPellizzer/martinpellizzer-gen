    "intro": "Vaccinium collivagum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dune environments. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically a deep blue or purple color, rich in antioxidants. It has small, elliptical leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. Vaccinium collivagum plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal soils."
