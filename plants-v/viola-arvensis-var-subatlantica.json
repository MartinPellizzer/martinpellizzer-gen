It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes, cliffs, and coastal grasslands. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple and white. It is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
