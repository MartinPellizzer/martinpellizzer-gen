    "intro": "Viola hirta subsp. dehnhardtii, commonly known as the Alpine violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces showy violet flowers with five petals, often in shades of purple or blue. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
