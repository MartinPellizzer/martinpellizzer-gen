    "intro": "Viola aethnensis, commonly known as the Etna violet, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of its habitat. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring, adding a splash of color to the rugged landscape. Viola aethnensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
