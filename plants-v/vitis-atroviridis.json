    "intro": "Vitis atroviridis, commonly known as the blackcurrant vine, is a deciduous woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, black berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive berries. Vitis atroviridis is a member of the Vitaceae family, which includes other well-known vines such as grapes and poison ivy. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
