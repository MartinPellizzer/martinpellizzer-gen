    "intro": "Vella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular pod that splits open when mature. Vella is often found in disturbed areas and can become invasive in certain regions."
