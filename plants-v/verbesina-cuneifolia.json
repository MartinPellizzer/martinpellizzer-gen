It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its upright growth habit and feathery foliage make it a distinctive feature in wetland ecosystems. Verbesina cuneifolia is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
