    "intro": "Vachellia nilotica subsp. cupressiformis, commonly known as the African burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that resembles cypress, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, followed by woody pods containing flattened, leathery seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood."
