    "intro": "Vicia lentoides, commonly known as the lentil vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Vicia lentoides plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a notable species in botanical studies and sustainable landscaping."
