    "intro": "Viburnum propinquum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its dense, rounded form. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and they turn yellow in the autumn. Viburnum propinquum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
