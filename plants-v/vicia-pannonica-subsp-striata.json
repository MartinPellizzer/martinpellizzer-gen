    "intro": "Vicia pannonica subsp. striata, commonly known as the striated vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Pannonian region of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive striated pattern on the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
