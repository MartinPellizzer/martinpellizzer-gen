It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
