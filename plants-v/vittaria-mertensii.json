    "intro": "Vittaria mertensii, commonly known as the Mertens' fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that often grow on tree trunks or branches. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to anchor itself to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, linear segments, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Vittaria mertensii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
