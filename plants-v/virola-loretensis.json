    "intro": "Virola loretensis, commonly known as the Loretto mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing numerous seeds. Virola loretensis is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and cabinetry. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
