It is characterized by its aromatic, often pink or white flowers and its distinctive, fragrant foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shores and dunes, adapting to saline and windy conditions. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for its calming properties. Valeriana atlantica plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
