    "intro": "Vetrix sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian vetrix, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vetrix sicula is considered a vulnerable species."
