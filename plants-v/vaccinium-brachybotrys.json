    "intro": "Vaccinium brachybotrys, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy surface and turn red in the fall. Vaccinium brachybotrys is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
