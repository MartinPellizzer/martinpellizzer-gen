It is a deciduous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, sweet berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
