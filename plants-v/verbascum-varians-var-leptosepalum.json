    "intro": "Verbascum varians var. leptosepalum, commonly known as the slender-sepal mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, velvety gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, fuzzy yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is closely related to other mullein species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
