    "intro": "Viola olympica var. samothracica, commonly known as the Samothracian violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the Greek island of Samothraki. This flowering plant belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and purple-pink flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant's botanical features include a short, hairy stem and small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
