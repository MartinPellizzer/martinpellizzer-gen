    "intro": "Vitis labrusca var. labruscoides, commonly known as the fox grape, is a North American vine species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries and its vigorous climbing growth habit. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically greenish-white in color. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other grape species but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
