    "intro": "Vaccaria hispanica var. vaccaria, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
