    "intro": "Vernonia parryae, commonly known as Parry's ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Vernonia parryae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
