    "intro": "Verbascum dentifolium, commonly known as the fuzzy leaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are toothed along the edges. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum dentifolium is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
