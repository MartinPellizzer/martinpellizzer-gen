    "intro": "Viscago multiflora, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Viscago multiflora plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing the growth of its host trees."
