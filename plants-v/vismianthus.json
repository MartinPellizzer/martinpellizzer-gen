    "intro": "Vismianthus, commonly known as the Indian satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their smooth, often aromatic bark and simple, alternate leaves. Vismianthus species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. These plants are valued for their wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments, as well as for their potential medicinal properties."
