    "intro": "Vaccinium pachydermum, commonly known as the thick-leaved blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many other berry-producing plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, a dark blue to black berry, is typically harvested in the fall and is used both for culinary purposes and in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, forested areas."
