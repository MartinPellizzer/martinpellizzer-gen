    "intro": "Verbascum thapsum, commonly known as the silkyleaf mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, silvery-gray hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Verbascum thapsum is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands."
