It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
