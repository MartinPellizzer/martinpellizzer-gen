    "intro": "Verbascum phlomoides var. semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy leaves that gradually curve downward toward the base. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are robust and can spread along the ground. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
