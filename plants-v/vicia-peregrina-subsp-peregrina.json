It features slender, upright stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
