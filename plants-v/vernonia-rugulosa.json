It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia rugulosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
