    "intro": "Viola gracilescens, commonly known as the slender violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet or purple, often with a yellow center, during the spring and early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its role in supporting pollinators."
