    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus subsp. thapsus, commonly known as goatweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has large, soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
