    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. subhirsuta, commonly known as the hairy grapevine, is a less common cultivar within the Vitis vinifera species. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other grape varieties. The plant typically produces small, tart berries that are not commonly used for wine or table grapes. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited cultivation, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
