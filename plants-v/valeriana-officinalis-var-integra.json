    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. integra, commonly known as the common valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are the primary source of its medicinal compounds, including valerenic acid and valepotriates. Valerian is widely used in traditional medicine for its calming effects and is often employed to treat insomnia and anxiety."
