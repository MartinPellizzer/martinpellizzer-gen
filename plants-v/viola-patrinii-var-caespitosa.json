    "intro": "Viola patrinii var. caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing habit with rhizomatous stems that form dense mats, allowing it to spread and colonize various habitats. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically violet or purple, with five petals. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in natural ecosystems."
