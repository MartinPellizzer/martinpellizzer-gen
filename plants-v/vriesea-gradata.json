    "intro": "Vriesea gradata, commonly known as the star sapphire bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Vriesea gradata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical appearance."
