    "intro": "Vatica lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and robust, hardy wood that is highly valued in construction and furniture-making. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often considered a conservation priority in its native habitats."
