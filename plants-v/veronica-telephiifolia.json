    "intro": "Veronica telephiifolia, commonly known as the silverweed veronica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Veronica telephiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
