It is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
