    "intro": "Verbesina subrotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf beggar-tick, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant features heart-shaped, rough-textured leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its common name reflects its prickly seed capsules, which adhere to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal."
