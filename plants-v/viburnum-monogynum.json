    "intro": "Viburnum monogynum, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes that persist into the fall. Viburnum monogynum is valued in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
