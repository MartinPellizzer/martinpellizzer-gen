    "intro": "Vitex subspicata, commonly known as the fragrant verbena or blue mist shrub, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms. Vitex subspicata is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
