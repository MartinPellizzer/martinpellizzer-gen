It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions of Virginia and the Carolinas. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and structures. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. The berries, which are usually yellow or red, are edible and have a tart flavor, making them suitable for winemaking and culinary use."
