    "intro": "Vaccinium chengiae var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Vacciniaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its berries are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blueberry varieties. This plant is typically found in shaded, moist forest habitats in its native range."
