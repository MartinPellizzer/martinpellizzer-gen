    "intro": "Vitis vulpina var. yzabalana, commonly known as the Yzabalana grapevine, is a rare and lesser-known cultivar of the Vitis genus. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in parts of Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and the production of small, dark purple berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland areas near rivers or in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it holds significance for botanical research and conservation efforts."
