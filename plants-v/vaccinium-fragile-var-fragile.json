    "intro": "Vaccinium fragile var. fragile, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to acidic, peaty soils in northern regions. It produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in culinary applications. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It blooms with pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by its characteristic berries. This variety is particularly adapted to wet, cold environments and plays an important role in its ecosystem."
