    "intro": "Viburnum tomentosum f. cuspidatum, commonly known as the prickly ninebark, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive grayish-white pubescence on both sides, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces flat, white panicles of flowers in early summer, followed by red, persistent berries that provide food for wildlife. Its dense growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural landscapes. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively low maintenance once established."
