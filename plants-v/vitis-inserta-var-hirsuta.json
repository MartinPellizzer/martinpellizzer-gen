    "intro": "Vitis inserta var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy fox grape, is a rare and less commonly cultivated species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered clusters of dark blue to black berries, which are typically edible but not widely consumed. It is native to parts of East Asia, particularly China and Korea, and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and limited cultivation, it is often found in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
