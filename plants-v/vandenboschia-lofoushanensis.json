    "intro": "Vandenboschia lofoushanensis, commonly known as the Lufoushan sandplant, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick cuticles and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
