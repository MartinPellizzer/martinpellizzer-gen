It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature. Due to its habitat, it is often found in mountainous areas and is considered a rare and specialized species."
