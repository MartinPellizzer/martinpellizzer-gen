It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its tuberous roots are a notable botanical feature, contributing to its resilience in arid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
