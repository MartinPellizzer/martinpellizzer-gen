    "intro": "Virola carinata, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. Virola carinata is also valued for its potential medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
