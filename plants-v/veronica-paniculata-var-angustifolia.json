    "intro": "Veronica paniculata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
