    "intro": "Vanilla sotoarenasii, commonly known as the Soto Arenas vanilla, is a rare orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, wrinkled pods that contain the aromatic vanilla flavor compounds, similar to the more well-known Vanilla planifolia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in tropical rainforests. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique and valuable botanical species."
