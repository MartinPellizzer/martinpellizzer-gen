    "intro": "Valeriana excelsa, commonly known as the giant valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest species in the Valerianaceae family. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Valeriana excelsa thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in cloud forests or high-altitude meadows. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest in horticultural studies."
