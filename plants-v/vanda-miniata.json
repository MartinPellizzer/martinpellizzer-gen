    "intro": "Vanda miniata, commonly known as the orchid with the pink and white flowers, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, thin stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including pink, white, and red. The plant has broad, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Vanda miniata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. It is popular among orchid growers for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
