It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
