    "intro": "Vicia capreolata, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, stipitate leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Vicia capreolata is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species often found in alpine regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
