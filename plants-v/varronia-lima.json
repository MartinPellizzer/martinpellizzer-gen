    "intro": "Varronia lima, commonly known as the Lima bean plant, is a herbaceous annual legume native to the Andean regions of South America. It features compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds. The plant is valued for its high-protein seeds, which are widely cultivated for food. It thrives in warm, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nutritional crop and its contribution to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
