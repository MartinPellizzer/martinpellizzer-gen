It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet or purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting soil fertility."
