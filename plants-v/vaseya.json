    "intro": "Vaseya, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stems. The plant has floating leaves with a waxy surface that repels water, a feature known as the lotus effect. Vaseya thrives in shallow freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Its symbolic significance in various cultures is closely tied to its botanical beauty and resilience."
