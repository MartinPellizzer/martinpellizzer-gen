    "intro": "Vicinia squamifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or squamifoliate vine, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round fruits. Vicinia squamifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
