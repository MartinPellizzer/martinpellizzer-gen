    "intro": "Vaccinium fragile var. crinitum, commonly known as the silky blueberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are usually blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas and moist woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
