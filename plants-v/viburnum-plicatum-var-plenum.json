    "intro": "Viburnum plicatum var. plenum, commonly known as the full-leaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green foliage that remains full and leathery throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, requiring moderate water and pruning for optimal shape and flowering."
