    "intro": "Vriesea platynema var. striata, commonly known as the Zebra Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, striped leaves that range from green to yellow and orange, creating a zebra-like pattern. The plant typically produces a tall flower spike with bright red bracts that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in indoor gardens due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
