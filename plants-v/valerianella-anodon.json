    "intro": "Valerianella anodon, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in the early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Valerianella anodon is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces efficiently."
