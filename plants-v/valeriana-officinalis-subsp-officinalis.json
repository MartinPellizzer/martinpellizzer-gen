    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis subsp. officinalis, commonly known as common valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its rhizomatous root system is the primary source of its medicinal compounds, including valepotriates and iridoids. Valerian is widely used in traditional medicine for its sedative and calming properties."
