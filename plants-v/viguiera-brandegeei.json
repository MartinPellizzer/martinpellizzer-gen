It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple composite flower heads that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
