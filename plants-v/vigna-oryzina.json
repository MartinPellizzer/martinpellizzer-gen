It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several kidney-shaped seeds. Vigna oryzina is valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and can be cooked like lentils. It also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
