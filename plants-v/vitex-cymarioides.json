It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in winter. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, dry seeds. Vitex cymarioides is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
