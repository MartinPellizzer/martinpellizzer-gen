    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vetenata dubia f. violascens, commonly known as the violet-stemmed false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often violet-hued stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of pale blue to lavender flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
