    "intro": "Vaccinium rizalense, commonly known as the Rizal blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
