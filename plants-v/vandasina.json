    "intro": "Vandasina, commonly known as the orchid vine, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their climbing habit and the presence of aerial roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Vandasina species typically produce striking, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and red. They thrive in humid, tropical environments and require bright, indirect light for optimal growth. The genus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
