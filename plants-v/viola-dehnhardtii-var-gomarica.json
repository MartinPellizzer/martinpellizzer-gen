    "intro": "Viola dehnhardtii var. gomarica, commonly known as the Gomarica violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle yet striking color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
