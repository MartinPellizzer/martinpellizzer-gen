It features compound leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red to purple berries in the fall. Its berries are edible but have a tart, astringent flavor. Viburnum erubescens is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting wildlife."
