    "intro": "Verbascum gossypinum, commonly known as the cotton thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woolly, gray-green leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is known for its robust growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. The cotton-like hairs on its leaves give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss in arid environments."
