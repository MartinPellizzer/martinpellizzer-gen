    "intro": "Vicia cappadocica, commonly known as Cappadocian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in early summer. Its pods contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Vicia cappadocica is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
