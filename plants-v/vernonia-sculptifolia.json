    "intro": "Vernonia sculptifolia, commonly known as the ridged ironweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that are covered in distinctive, ridged, and often hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of small, spiky, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, textured surface, contributing to its unique appearance. Vernonia sculptifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
