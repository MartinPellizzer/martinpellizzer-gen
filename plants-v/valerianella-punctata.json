It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Valerianella punctata thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along pathways, and in gardens. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is known for its delicate, peppery scent."
