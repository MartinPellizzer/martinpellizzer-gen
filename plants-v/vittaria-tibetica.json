    "intro": "Vittaria tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on steep slopes. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Vittaria tibetica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
