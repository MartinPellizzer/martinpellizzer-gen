    "intro": "Verbena canescens f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming from late spring to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
