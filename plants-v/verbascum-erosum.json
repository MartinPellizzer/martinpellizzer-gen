    "intro": "Verbascum erosum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbalism. The plant's unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in its native habitats."
