    "intro": "Vicia sericocarpa subsp. urfae, commonly known as the Urfa vetch, is a rare and endangered legume native to Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, silky-haired pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
