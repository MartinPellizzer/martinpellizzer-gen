It typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, often displaying shades of pink or purple. This variety is noted for its resilience to cold temperatures and is a characteristic component of alpine flora in its native range."
