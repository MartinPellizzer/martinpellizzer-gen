    "intro": "Vitis adstricta, commonly known as the creeping grape or swamp grape, is a deciduous vine native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy underside and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant's berries are typically dark purple or black when mature and are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Vitis adstricta thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near water sources. It is a perennial plant that can spread aggressively through its rhizomes, making it both a useful plant for erosion control and a potential weed in certain environments."
