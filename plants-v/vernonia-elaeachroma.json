    "intro": "Vernonia elaeachroma, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, hard wood and dense foliage, which makes it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Vernonia elaeachroma is valued for its durability and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
