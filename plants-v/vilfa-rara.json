    "intro": "Vilfa rara, commonly known as the rare violet flower, is a delicate perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reflect intense sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant purple flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Vilfa rara is considered an endangered species."
