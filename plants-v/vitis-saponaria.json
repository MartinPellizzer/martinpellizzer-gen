    "intro": "Vitis saponaria, commonly known as soapberry vine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. These berries contain a milky sap that has a soapy texture, giving the plant its common name. Vitis saponaria is often used in traditional medicine and has ornamental value in gardens."
