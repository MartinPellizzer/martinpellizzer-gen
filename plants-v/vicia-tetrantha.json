    "intro": "Vicia tetrantha, commonly known as the four-angled vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Vicia tetrantha has small, alternate leaves with a distinctive four-angled stem, which is a key identifying feature. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
