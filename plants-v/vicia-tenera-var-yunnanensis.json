It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
