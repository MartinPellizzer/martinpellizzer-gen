    "intro": "Virgulus yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra and wetland habitats. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are wind-pollinated. Virgulus yukonensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, harsh environment."
