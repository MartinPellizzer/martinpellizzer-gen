    "intro": "Veronica panormitana, commonly known as the Sicilian speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit with opposite leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
