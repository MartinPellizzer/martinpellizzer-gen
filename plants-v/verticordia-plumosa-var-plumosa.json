    "intro": "Verticordia plumosa var. plumosa, commonly known as the plumose stickleback, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dense clusters of bright red or orange flowers that appear in spring. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators."
