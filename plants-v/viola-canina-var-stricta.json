    "intro": "Viola canina var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, downy hairs. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
