    "intro": "Vaccinium corymbosum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower blueberry, is a botanical variant of the common blueberry. It is characterized by its pale white or cream-colored flowers, which distinguish it from the typical blue or pink blooms of the species. This form is typically found in the eastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, edible berries similar to those of the common blueberry, though they may have a slightly different flavor profile. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and potential for cultivation in specialty gardens."
