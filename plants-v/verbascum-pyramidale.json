It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a pyramid-like arrangement, giving it its species name \"pyramidale.\" Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Verbascum pyramidale thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and dry garden environments."
