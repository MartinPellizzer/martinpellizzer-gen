    "intro": "Vitis multiloba, commonly known as the eastern grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Vitis multiloba is typically found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its historical use by Native American tribes for food and medicinal purposes highlights its ecological and cultural significance."
