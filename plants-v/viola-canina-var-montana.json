    "intro": "Viola canina var. montana, commonly known as the Alpine violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive shape and pattern. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, downy coating, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Viola canina var. montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
