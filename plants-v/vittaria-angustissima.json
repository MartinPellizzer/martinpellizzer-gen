    "intro": "Vittaria angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
