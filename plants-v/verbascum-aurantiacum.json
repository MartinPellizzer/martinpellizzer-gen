    "intro": "Verbascum aurantiacum, commonly known as the yellow mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Verbascum aurantiacum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
