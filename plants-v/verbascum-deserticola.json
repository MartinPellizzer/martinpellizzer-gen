    "intro": "Verbascum deserticola, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability. Verbascum deserticola is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
