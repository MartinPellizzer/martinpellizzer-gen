    "intro": "Vellozia schnizleinia var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Vellozia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its growth habit is typically compact, with a branching structure that forms a dense, rounded form. Vellozia schnizleinia var. occidentalis is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
