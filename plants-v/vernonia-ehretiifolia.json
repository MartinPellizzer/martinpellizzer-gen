    "intro": "Vernonia ehretiifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist or smoke, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Vernonia ehretiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
