    "intro": "Vitis vitacea, commonly known as the Florida grape or swamp grape, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually yellow or red when mature. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as swamps and riverbanks, and is often found in the understory of hardwood forests. Vitis vitacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
