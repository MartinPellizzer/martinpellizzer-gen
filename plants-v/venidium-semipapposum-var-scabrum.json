It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy or rough surfaces. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming dense inflorescences that bloom in late summer or early autumn. This variant is distinguished by its unique foliage and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ecological and ornamental potential."
