It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is the blue to purple mist-like appearance of its flower heads, which consist of numerous tiny disc florets. Vernonia cana thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
