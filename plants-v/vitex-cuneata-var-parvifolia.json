    "intro": "Vitex cuneata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the parvifolia vitex or small-leaved chaste tree, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically grayish-green on the upper surface and whitish on the underside, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pale blue to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is upright and branching, making it suitable for hedges or small garden spaces. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
