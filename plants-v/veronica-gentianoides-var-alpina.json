    "intro": "Veronica gentianoides var. alpina, commonly known as alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators in alpine ecosystems."
