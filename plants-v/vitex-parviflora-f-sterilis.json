    "intro": "Vitex parviflora f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile velvetwood, is a variant of the velvetwood plant native to parts of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub characterized by its grayish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Unlike the typical form, this variety is sterile, meaning it does not produce flowers or fruits. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions."
