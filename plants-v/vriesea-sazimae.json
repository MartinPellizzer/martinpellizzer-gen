    "intro": "Vriesea sazimae, commonly known as the Sazimae Flameleaf, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathiform bracts that display a fiery red to orange hue, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that emerge from the base of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea sazimae is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
