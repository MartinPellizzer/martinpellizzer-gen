    "intro": "Vanzijlia rostellum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
