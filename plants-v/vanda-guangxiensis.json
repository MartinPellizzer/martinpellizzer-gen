    "intro": "Vanda guangxiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi vanda, is a species of orchid native to southern China, particularly Guangxi Province. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda guangxiensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in various environmental conditions."
