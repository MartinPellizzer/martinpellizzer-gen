    "intro": "Veronica verticillata, commonly known as the whorled speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Veronica verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its delicate appearance."
