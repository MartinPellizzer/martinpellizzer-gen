    "intro": "Vitex capitata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered chaste tree, is a variant of the chaste tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to sunny, well-drained soils."
