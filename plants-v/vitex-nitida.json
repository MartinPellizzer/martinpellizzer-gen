    "intro": "Vitex nitida, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vitex nitida is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
