    "intro": "Vitis intramarginalis, commonly known as the marginal grapevine, is a rare and less-studied species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive foliage, with leaves that often have a margin that appears to be folded or rolled. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by berries that are typically black when mature. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it grows in humid, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
