    "intro": "Viscum littorum, commonly known as the sea buckthorn, is a parasitic shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It attaches itself to host trees such as oak and pine using haustoria, which extract nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. Its leaves are alternate and scale-like, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Viscum littorum thrives in salty, windy environments, making it a resilient species adapted to coastal habitats."
