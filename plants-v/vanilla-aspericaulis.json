    "intro": "Vanilla aspericaulis, commonly known as the rough vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It produces long, slender stems that can reach several meters in length, often growing along tree trunks or other supports. The plant's leaves are elliptical and covered with a fine, rough texture, giving it its common name. It flowers with fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white blossoms that are typically not used for vanilla extraction. The fruit, a curved pod, contains small, dark seeds and is rarely harvested for commercial use."
