It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It requires well-draining potting media and regular watering to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
