    "intro": "Viburnum cinnamomifolium, commonly known as sweet viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green above and grayish-white below, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, floral display, and autumn fruit, making it a popular choice for gardens. Viburnum cinnamomifolium is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
