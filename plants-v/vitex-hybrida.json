    "intro": "Vitex hybrida, commonly known as the chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its showy, fragrant flowers that range from purple to white, appearing in summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits called drupes, which contain a single seed. Vitex hybrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
