    "intro": "Vicia vulcanorum, commonly known as the Vulcan's vetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Italy. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or volcanic landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
