    "intro": "Vriesea chrysostachys var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender inflorescence that produces vibrant orange to red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
