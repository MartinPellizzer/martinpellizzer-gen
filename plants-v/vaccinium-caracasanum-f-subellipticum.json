    "intro": "Vaccinium caracasanum f. subellipticum, commonly known as the subelliptic blueberry, is a botanical variant of the caracasanum species within the Vacciniaceae family. It is characterized by its elliptical, subelliptic leaves that are typically darker green and more elongated compared to the standard form. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by edible berries that are typically blue or red in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest regions. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for cultivation."
