    "intro": "Veronica gorumsensis, commonly known as the Gorumsen's speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Veronica gorumsensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
