    "intro": "Viola betonicifolia subsp. jaunsariensis, commonly known as the Jaunsari violet, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces violet-blue flowers with five petals. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and frost resistance. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
