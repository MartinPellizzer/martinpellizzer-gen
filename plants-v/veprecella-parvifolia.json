    "intro": "Veprecella parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved veprecella, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically small and fern-like in appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions."
