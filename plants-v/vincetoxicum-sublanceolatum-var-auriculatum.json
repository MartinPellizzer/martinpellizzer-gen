    "intro": "Vincetoxicum sublanceolatum var. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate false bindweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with auriculate (ear-shaped) bases, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in moist soils along stream banks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable weed in certain regions."
