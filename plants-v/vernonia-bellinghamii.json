It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, bract-like leaves at the base of its flower clusters.
