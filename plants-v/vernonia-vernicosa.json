    "intro": "Vernonia vernicosa, commonly known as the yellow ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, waxy bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Vernonia vernicosa is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
