    "intro": "Vochysia stenophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant features large, palmate leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in many regions."
