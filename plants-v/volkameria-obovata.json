The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are broadly ovate and often covered in a fine, white or gray pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
