    "intro": "Valantia hispida var. hispida, commonly known as the rough valantia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
