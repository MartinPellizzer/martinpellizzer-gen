    "intro": "Veratrum virescens, commonly known as green hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It contains various toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. Botanically, it is classified in the family Melanthiaceae, though it is often grouped with related genera in the Ranunculaceae family."
