It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems and basal leaves. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a head, resembling those of a dandelion. It is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
