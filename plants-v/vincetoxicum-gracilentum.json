    "intro": "Vincetoxicum gracilentum, commonly known as red baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features striking, compound leaves that are palmately lobed and often adorned with a white or pale green midrib. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into bright red, poisonous berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
