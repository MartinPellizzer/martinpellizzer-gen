It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring silvery-gray foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance and adaptability to arid environments. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
