    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. sambucifolia, commonly known as the sambucus-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, somewhat woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that resemble those of the elderberry plant. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and contains the active compounds responsible for its medicinal properties. This variant is often cultivated for its calming effects and is used in traditional herbal medicine."
