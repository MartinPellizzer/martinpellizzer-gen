    "intro": "Vernonia undulata, commonly known as the wavy ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and streambanks. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, yellow to orange flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a wavy or undulating margin, which gives it its common name. Vernonia undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
