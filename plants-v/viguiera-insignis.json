    "intro": "Viguiera insignis, commonly known as Mexican heath. It is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America, belonging to the Asteraceae family. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Viguiera insignis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
