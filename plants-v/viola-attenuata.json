    "intro": "Viola attenuata, commonly known as the slender violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, often adorned with a distinctive yellow or white spot at the base. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Viola attenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
