    "intro": "Vernonia polysphaera, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is known for its striking blue or purple flower clusters, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia polysphaera typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Its foliage is usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
