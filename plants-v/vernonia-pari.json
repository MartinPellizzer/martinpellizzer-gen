    "intro": "Vernonia pari, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, blue-to-purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in clumps, often reaching heights of 2 to 4 feet. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia pari is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
