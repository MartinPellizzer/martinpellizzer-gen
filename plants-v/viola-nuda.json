    "intro": "Viola nuda, commonly known as the naked violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring upright stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive white or yellow marking at the base. Viola nuda prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch of color to the landscape."
