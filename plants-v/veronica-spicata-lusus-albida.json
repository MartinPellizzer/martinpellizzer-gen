    "intro": "Veronica spicata lusus albida, commonly known as the white loosestrife, is a cultivar of the common speedwell plant. It is characterized by its dense spikes of white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and prefers full sun to partial shade. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value. This variety is a sterile form, meaning it does not produce seeds, making it ideal for controlled garden settings."
