    "intro": "Vriesea odorata, commonly known as the Sweet Vriesea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea odorata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
