    "intro": "Verbena runyonii, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its narrow, gray-green leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbena runyonii is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
