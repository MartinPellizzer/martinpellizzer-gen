    "intro": "Viola sieboldii f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated violet, is a hybrid cultivar of the viola genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display shades of white, green, and yellow, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, typically purple or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its foliage as much as its flowers."
