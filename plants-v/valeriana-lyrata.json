    "intro": "Valeriana lyrata, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, heart-shaped leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Valeriana lyrata is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its calming properties."
