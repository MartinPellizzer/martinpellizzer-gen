It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to white in color, which bloom in early spring. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are edible and often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. Its leaves are oval and glossy, and the plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest understory diversity."
