    "intro": "Vermeulenia chlorotica, commonly known as the green-spored moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, branching stems covered with small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, contain spores that are greenish in hue, giving the plant its common name. Vermeulenia chlorotica is often found in temperate regions, growing on soil, rocks, or decaying wood."
