    "intro": "Viracocha paleata, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the sunflower, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds that are often used in traditional Andean cuisine. It thrives in cool, dry climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Viracocha paleata plays an important role in both ecological systems and cultural practices of the Andean communities."
