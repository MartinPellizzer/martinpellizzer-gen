    "intro": "Valeriana alliariifolia var. subintegra, commonly known as the smooth valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are small, white or pale pink, arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant produces a strong, often unpleasant odor, characteristic of the Valeriana genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, less hairy leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
