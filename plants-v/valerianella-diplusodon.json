    "intro": "Valerianella diplusodon, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Valerianella diplusodon thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its leaves are sometimes used in salads, though they have a mild, peppery taste."
