    "intro": "Valeriana amurensis, commonly known as Amur valerian, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia, particularly found in regions of Russia, China, and Korea. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana amurensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks."
