    "intro": "Vriesea sparsiflora var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces an inflorescence with bright, long-lasting flowers that range from yellow to orange, often with red or pink accents. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
