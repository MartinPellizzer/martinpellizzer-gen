    "intro": "Vernonia tungurahuae, commonly known as the Tungurahua Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its yellowish to brownish flowers are small and clustered, forming dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
