    "intro": "Vanilla sarapiquensis, commonly known as the Sarapiqu\u00ed vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along its vine-like stems. The plant relies on specific pollinators, primarily certain species of bees, for successful reproduction. Its vanilla pods, which develop after fertilization, are harvested and used in the production of vanilla extract. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
