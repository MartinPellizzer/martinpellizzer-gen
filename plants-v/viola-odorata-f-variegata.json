    "intro": "Viola odorata f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated sweet violet, is a cultivar of the sweet violet plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring a mix of green and white or cream-colored patterns on the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, aromatic blossoms."
