    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys subsp. micans, commonly known as the silver germander, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its silvery foliage and long flowering period."
