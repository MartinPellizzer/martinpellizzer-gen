    "intro": "Vanda malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive waxy texture. Vanda malipoensis thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in the diverse flora of its native habitats."
