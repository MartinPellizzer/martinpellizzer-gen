    "intro": "Vicia cracca var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variety is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various insects."
