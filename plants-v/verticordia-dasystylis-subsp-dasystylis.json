It is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous inflorescences that display a mix of pink and white flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in heathland or open woodland habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
