    "intro": "Vanda teres var. candida, commonly known as the White Vanda, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. Vanda teres var. candida requires bright, indirect light and high humidity to thrive."
