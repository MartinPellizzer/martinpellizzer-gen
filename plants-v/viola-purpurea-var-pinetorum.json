    "intro": "Viola purpurea var. pinetorum, commonly known as the purple violet or woodland violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green color and a distinctive purple-tinged stem. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive lower petal that curves backward. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to woodland ecosystems, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity."
