    "intro": "Verbena calcicola, commonly known as the limestone verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its narrow, gray-green leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Verbena calcicola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
