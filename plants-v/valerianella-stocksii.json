    "intro": "Valerianella stocksii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf valerian, is a flowering plant in the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Valerianella stocksii is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties."
