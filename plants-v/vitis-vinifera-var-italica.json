    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. italica, commonly known as the Italian grapevine, is a cultivar of the common grapevine native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and the production of small, thick-skinned berries that are typically used for winemaking. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a period of winter dormancy. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of fruit that ripen in late summer. This variety is valued for its adaptability and contribution to regional wine traditions."
