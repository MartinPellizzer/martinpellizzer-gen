    "intro": "Verbascum blattaria var. glabrum, commonly known as the silky hairplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and tall, slender stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its common name reflects the silky texture of its foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is a variant of the broader Verbascum blattaria species, distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the leaves."
