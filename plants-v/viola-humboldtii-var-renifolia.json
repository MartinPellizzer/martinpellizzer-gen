    "intro": "Viola humboldtii var. renifolia, commonly known as the Humboldt violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are characteristic of the renifolia variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with yellow markings, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
