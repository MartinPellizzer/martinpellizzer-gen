It features dense, mat-forming foliage with rounded, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant ground cover."
