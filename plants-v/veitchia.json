    "intro": "Veitchia, commonly known as the tree fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems and large, pinnate leaves that give them a fern-like appearance. Veitchia species often have a single trunk with a crown of fronds, and they can grow quite tall, reaching up to 10 meters in height. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in horticulture and landscape design."
