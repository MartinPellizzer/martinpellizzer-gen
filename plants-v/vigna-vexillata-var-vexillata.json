    "intro": "Vigna vexillata var. vexillata, commonly known as the African snail bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein. The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
