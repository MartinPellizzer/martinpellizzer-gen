    "intro": "Vigna phoenix, commonly known as the desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, annual legume that produces small, pale green pods containing edible seeds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, featuring deep roots and a hairy, waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Vigna phoenix is valued for its hardiness and potential as a sustainable crop in dryland agriculture."
