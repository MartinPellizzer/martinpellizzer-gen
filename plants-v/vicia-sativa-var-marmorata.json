    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. marmorata, commonly known as the marble vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive mottled leaves with a marbled pattern of green and white, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides. Vicia sativa var. marmorata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in agricultural settings."
