    "intro": "Veronica virginica var. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This variant is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate regions."
