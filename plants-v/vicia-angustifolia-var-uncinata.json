    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The leaves are trifoliate, with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and distinctive hooked tendrils at the tips. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
