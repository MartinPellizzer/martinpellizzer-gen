    "intro": "Viburnum bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian hawthorn, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Viburnum bolivianum thrives in dry to semi-arid conditions and is adapted to rocky or limestone soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable climates."
