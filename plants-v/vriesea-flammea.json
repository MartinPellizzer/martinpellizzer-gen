    "intro": "Vriesea flammea, commonly known as the Flame Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red inflorescence that resembles a flame, giving it its common name. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea flammea is popular as a decorative plant due to its longevity and ability to bloom repeatedly over several years."
