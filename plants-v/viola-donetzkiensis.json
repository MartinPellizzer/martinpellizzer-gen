    "intro": "Viola donetzkiensis, commonly known as the Donetsky viola, is a rare and endangered species native to the Donets Basin in Ukraine. It is a low-growing perennial herb with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its flowers have five petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
