    "intro": "Viburnum dilatatum f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy arrowwood, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. Its growth habit is upright and rounded, with a dense, bushy form that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental plantings. The foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in the landscape."
