    "intro": "Vincetoxicum variifolium, commonly known as the variable leaf false bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in shape and size, giving it its common name. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or red, with five lobes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Vincetoxicum variifolium is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread through rhizomes."
