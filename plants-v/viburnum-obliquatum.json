    "intro": "Viburnum obliquatum, commonly known as the oblique viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum obliquatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun."
