It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice in gardens. However, due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
