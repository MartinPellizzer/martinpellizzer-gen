    "intro": "Vanilla edwallii, commonly known as the Edwall's vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's most notable feature is its long, thin, greenish-brown pod, which develops after successful pollination. The pod contains numerous small, dark brown seeds surrounded by a sweet, aromatic pulp. This species is valued for its unique flavor profile and is used in culinary and aromatic applications."
