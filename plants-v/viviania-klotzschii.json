    "intro": "Viviania klotzschii, commonly known as the Cape mountain lily, is a perennial herb native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, stout stem that supports its floral display. Viviania klotzschii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
