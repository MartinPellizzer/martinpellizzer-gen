    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica subsp. michauxii, commonly known as the water speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features opposite, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater, often found in marshes and along pond edges. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize wet areas make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
