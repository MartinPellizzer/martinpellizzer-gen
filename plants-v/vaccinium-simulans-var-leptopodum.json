    "intro": "Vaccinium simulans var. leptopodum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant bears edible, bright red berries that are similar in taste to highbush blueberries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
