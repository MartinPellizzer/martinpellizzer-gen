    "intro": "Viola allchariensis var. prilepensis, commonly known as the Prilep viola, is a rare and endemic species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has small, hairy stems and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
