    "intro": "Viola dehnhardtii f. cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii violet, is a rare and ornamental member of the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable plant for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
