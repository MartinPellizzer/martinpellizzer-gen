    "intro": "Veitchia joannis, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces massive, cone-like structures that are typically yellow when mature. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
