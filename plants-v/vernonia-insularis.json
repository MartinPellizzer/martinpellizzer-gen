    "intro": "Vernonia insularis, commonly known as the island ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and robust. Vernonia insularis plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native environment, providing nectar for native pollinators."
