    "intro": "Vittaria guineensis, commonly known as the Guinean maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria guineensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its aesthetic qualities."
