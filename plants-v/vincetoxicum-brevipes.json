    "intro": "Vincetoxicum brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed white bittersweet, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it a potentially harmful species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Vincetoxicum brevipes is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
