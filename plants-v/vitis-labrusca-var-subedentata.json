It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and acidic. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces tendrils that aid in climbing. This variety is less commonly cultivated for wine or table grapes compared to other Vitis labrusca species."
