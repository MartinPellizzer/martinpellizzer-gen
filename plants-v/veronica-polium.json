    "intro": "Veronica polium, commonly known as the purple speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Veronica polium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
