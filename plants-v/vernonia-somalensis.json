    "intro": "Vernonia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia and parts of East Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Vernonia somalensis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
