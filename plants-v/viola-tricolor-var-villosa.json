It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy or pubescent, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet, yellow, and white, depending on the variety. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. Viola tricolor var. villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
