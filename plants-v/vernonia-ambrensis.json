    "intro": "Vernonia ambrensis, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in the coastal regions of Florida and Georgia. Its yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
