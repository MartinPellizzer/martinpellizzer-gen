    "intro": "Vachellia xanthophloea, commonly known as the yellow-wood acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its yellowish-brown, flaky bark and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are followed by flat, leathery pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Vachellia xanthophloea is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
