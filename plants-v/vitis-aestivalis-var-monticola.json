    "intro": "Vitis aestivalis var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain grape, is a wild vine species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
