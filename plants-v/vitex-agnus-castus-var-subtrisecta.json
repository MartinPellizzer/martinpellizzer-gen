    "intro": "Vitex agnus-castus var. subtrisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chaste tree, is a variant of the chaste tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, three-lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, lavender-blue flowers in summer, which are followed by small, woody berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is less commonly found in cultivation compared to the standard Vitex agnus-castus."
