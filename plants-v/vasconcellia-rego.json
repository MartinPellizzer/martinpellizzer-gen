    "intro": "Vasconcellia rego, commonly known as the Rego's vasconcellia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
