    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum subsp. nanum, commonly known as dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wet, acidic environments in the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant is well adapted to boggy soils and has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland areas. Its berries, which are small and dark blue, are edible and often used in culinary applications. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
