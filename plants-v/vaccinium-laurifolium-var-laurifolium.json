It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and cranberries, and is characterized by its acidic soil preferences. The plant features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and remain evergreen throughout the year. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or purple in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wildlife habitat and native plant restoration projects."
