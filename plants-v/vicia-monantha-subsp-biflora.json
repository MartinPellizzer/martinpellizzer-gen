    "intro": "Vicia monantha subsp. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, arranged in clusters of two along the stem, giving it its subspecific name \"biflora.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
