It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia thyrsoidea is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
