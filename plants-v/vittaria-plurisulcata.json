    "intro": "Vittaria plurisulcata, commonly known as the many-ribbed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with intricate, branched veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria plurisulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
