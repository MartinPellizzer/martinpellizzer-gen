    "intro": "Valeriana bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system with clustered, bulb-like structures that store nutrients. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a strong, medicinal scent. Valeriana bulbosa is valued for its historical use in herbal medicine due to its sedative and calming properties."
