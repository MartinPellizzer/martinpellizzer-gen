    "intro": "Viburnum sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum sinensis thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
