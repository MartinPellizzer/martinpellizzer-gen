    "intro": "Vulpia incrassata var. letourneuxii, commonly known as the Letourneux's fescue, is a variant of the common fescue species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
