    "intro": "Vaccaria segetalis subsp. pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramidale or garden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
