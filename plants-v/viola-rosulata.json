    "intro": "Viola rosulata, commonly known as the Rosette Violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with yellow markings, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, which helps to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Viola rosulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with partial shade."
