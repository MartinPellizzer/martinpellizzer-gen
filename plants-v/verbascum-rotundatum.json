    "intro": "Verbascum rotundatum, commonly known as roundleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woolly leaves that are gray-green in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its common name comes from the rounded shape of its leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine."
