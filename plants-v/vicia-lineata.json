It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia lineata is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
