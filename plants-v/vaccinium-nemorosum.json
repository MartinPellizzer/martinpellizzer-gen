    "intro": "Vaccinium nemorosum, commonly known as the mountain blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, which are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, heathlands, and mountainous regions. Vaccinium nemorosum plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
