    "intro": "Vaccinium scortechinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the boreal forests of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which are followed by small, leathery berries. These berries are typically blue or dark purple when mature and are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Vaccinium species. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
