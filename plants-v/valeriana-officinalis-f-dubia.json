    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis f. dubia, commonly known as the variable valerian, is a botanical variant of the common valerian. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology and flowering patterns, which can differ significantly from the typical form. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, and it produces a distinctive, often strong, aromatic scent. This variant is valued in traditional medicine for its sedative properties, similar to the main species."
