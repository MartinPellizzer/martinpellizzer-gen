It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native habitat."
