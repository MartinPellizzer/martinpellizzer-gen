    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. wilczekii, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
