    "intro": "Vicia ramuliflora f. chianschanensis, commonly known as the Chian-shan vetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, where it forms dense, low-lying vegetation. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation and habitat loss."
