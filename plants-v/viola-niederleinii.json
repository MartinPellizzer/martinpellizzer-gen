    "intro": "Viola niederleinii, commonly known as the Niederlein's violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola niederleinii is considered a rare and endangered species."
