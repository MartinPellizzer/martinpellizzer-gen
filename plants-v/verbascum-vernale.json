    "intro": "Verbascum vernale, commonly known as the common mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides, fields, and wastelands. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum vernale is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
