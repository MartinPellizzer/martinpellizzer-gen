    "intro": "Viola mandshurica f. aureoreticulata, commonly known as the golden reticulated violet, is a rare and striking variant of the viola genus. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and green mottled leaves, which feature a reticulated pattern. The plant produces showy violet flowers with a pale lilac hue, often with a yellow throat. Native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a prized species among botanists and horticulturists."
