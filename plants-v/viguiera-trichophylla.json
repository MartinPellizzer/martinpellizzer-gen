    "intro": "Viguiera trichophylla, commonly known as the Mexican heather, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Viguiera trichophylla produces showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall."
