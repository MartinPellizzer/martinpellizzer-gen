    "intro": "Varronia bridgesii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in some areas."
