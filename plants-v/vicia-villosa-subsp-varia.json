    "intro": "Vicia villosa subsp. varia, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Vicia villosa subsp. varia is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and erosion control properties."
