    "intro": "Virola sebifera var. curvinervia, commonly known as the curving-veined mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and broad, glossy leaves. The leaves are typically elliptical with prominent, curving veins, giving it its botanical name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is valued for its durable wood but is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
