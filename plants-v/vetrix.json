It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Vetrix is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
