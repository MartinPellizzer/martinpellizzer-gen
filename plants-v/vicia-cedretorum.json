    "intro": "Vicia cedretorum, commonly known as the cedarnut vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, slender stems that bear small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods containing kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used as a food source for livestock. Vicia cedretorum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
