    "intro": "Verbena scabrella, commonly known as the silver verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom throughout the summer months."
