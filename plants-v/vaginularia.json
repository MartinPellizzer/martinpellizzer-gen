    "intro": "Vaginularia, commonly known as the \"sea mouse,\" is a genus of marine polychaete worms belonging to the family Spionidae. It is characterized by its soft, cylindrical body covered in fine, hair-like setae that aid in locomotion and feeding. These worms are typically found in sandy or muddy substrates in shallow coastal waters. Vaginularia species are suspension feeders, using their feathery palps to filter food particles from the water. They play an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and maintaining sediment stability."
