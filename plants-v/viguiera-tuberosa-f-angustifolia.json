    "intro": "Viguiera tuberosa f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf Mexican sunflower, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features upright, branching stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are bright orange to red, resembling those of the common sunflower. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
