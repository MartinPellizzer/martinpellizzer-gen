    "intro": "Vernonia vulgaris, commonly known as rough blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces, and its flower heads are composed of small blue to purple disc florets. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a fleshy, sticky appendage. Vernonia vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
