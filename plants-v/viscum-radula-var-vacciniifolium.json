    "intro": "Viscum radula var. vacciniifolium, commonly known as the red-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It possesses small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forests where its host species, such as oaks or maples, are present. Its unique botanical features make it both ecologically significant and visually distinctive in its habitat."
