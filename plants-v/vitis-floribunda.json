    "intro": "Vitis floribunda, commonly known as the Japanese grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature, though they may turn red or black depending on the variety. Vitis floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes."
