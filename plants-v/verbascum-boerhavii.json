    "intro": "Verbascum boerhavii, commonly known as the yellow mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broad, velvety, and covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry landscapes. This plant is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat respiratory ailments."
