    "intro": "Vitis asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-skinned grapevine, is a woody vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, often thorny stems and dark green, palmately lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they ripen. It is typically found in moist woodlands and stream banks, growing along the edges of rivers and in shaded areas. Vitis asperifolia is a member of the Vitaceae family and is known for its ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
