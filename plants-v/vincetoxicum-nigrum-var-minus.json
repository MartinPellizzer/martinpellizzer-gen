    "intro": "Vincetoxicum nigrum var. minus, commonly known as dwarf black nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its compact growth habit. It features small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible when fully ripe, though they can be toxic if consumed unripe. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and berries."
