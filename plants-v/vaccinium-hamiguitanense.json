It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and cranberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
