It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis serpens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural research."
