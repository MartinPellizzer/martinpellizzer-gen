    "intro": "Viscum liga, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees such as oaks and apples. It has a distinctive appearance with smooth, glossy green leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that appear in winter. The plant produces small, red berries that are a source of food for birds, which in turn help spread its seeds. Viscum liga lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is often associated with festive traditions and has cultural significance in various European countries."
