    "intro": "Vismia angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf vismia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Vismia angusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
