    "intro": "Vilfa richardii, commonly known as the Richard's violet, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vilfa richardii is considered a rare and endangered species."
