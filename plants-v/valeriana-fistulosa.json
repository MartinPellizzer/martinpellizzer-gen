    "intro": "Valeriana fistulosa, commonly known as the pipe-root valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust, tuberous root system that stores nutrients and helps it survive in harsh environments. The plant has upright, branched stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and are typically pink or purple in color. Valeriana fistulosa is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
