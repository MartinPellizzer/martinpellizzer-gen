    "intro": "Veronica paysonii, commonly known as Payson's speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
