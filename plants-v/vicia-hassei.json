    "intro": "Vicia hassei, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a legume characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seed pods are slender and contain several small, elliptical seeds. Vicia hassei is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
