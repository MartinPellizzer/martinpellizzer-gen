    "intro": "Vicia multijuga, commonly known as the broad-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and heart-shaped, and its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Vicia multijuga is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
