It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vigna calcarata is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, making it resilient in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it both a useful forage crop and a subject of botanical study."
