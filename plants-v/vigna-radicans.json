    "intro": "Vigna radicans, commonly known as the creeping bean or runner bean vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant has a trailing growth habit, with tendrils that help it climb and spread across supports. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets. Vigna radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its seeds in home gardens."
