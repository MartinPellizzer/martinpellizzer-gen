    "intro": "Vaccinium sprengelii, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, typically found in bogs, heaths, and wetlands. Its leaves are leathery and oval-shaped, with a dense, compact growth habit. Vaccinium sprengelii plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
