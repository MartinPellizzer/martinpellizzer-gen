    "intro": "Vinca sessilifolia, commonly known as the lesser periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
