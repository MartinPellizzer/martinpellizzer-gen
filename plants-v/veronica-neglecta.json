    "intro": "Veronica neglecta, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Veronica neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to naturalize."
