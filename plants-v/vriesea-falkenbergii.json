    "intro": "Vriesea falkenbergii, commonly known as the Falkenberg's bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear bright, long-lasting flowers in shades of orange and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea falkenbergii is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and seasonal blooming."
