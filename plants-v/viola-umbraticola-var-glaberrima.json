    "intro": "Viola umbraticola var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous woodland violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, though the variety glaberrima is distinguished by its nearly hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in shady, moist woodlands and is adapted to rich, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
