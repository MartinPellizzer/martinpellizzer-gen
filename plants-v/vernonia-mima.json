    "intro": "Vernonia mima, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are hairy and somewhat woody. Vernonia mima is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
