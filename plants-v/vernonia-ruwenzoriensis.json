    "intro": "Vernonia ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the East African mountain range, including the Rwenzori Mountains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its conical or cylindrical flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow to orange in color, often surrounded by pale green bracts. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
