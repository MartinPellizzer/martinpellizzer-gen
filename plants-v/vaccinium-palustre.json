    "intro": "Vaccinium palustre, commonly known as swamp blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the characteristic blue-black berries in the fall. These berries are not typically eaten by humans but are an important food source for wildlife such as birds and bears. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in wetland environments."
