    "intro": "Vitis erosa, commonly known as the sand grape or trailing fox grape, is a flowering vine native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to clusters of small, sour-tasting berries. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along stream banks and in woodland edges. Vitis erosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
