    "intro": "Vinca major subsp. major, commonly known as Persian violet, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that produces showy, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden areas. Its ability to spread rapidly through runners makes it effective for erosion control and filling in garden spaces."
