    "intro": "Vilfa stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It features dense, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
