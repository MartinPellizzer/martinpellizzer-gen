    "intro": "Verbascum vestitum, commonly known as the dressed mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, velvety gray-green hairs. The leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, cylindrical spike. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
