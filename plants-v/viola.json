    "intro": "Viola, commonly known as the violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous and can be annual or perennial, with heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Viola species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, blue, yellow, and white, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Many viola species are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and are also used in traditional medicine."
