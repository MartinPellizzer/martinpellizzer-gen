    "intro": "Vernonia hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. Vernonia hookeriana is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
