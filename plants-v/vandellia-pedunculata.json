    "intro": "Vandellia pedunculata, commonly known as the rock wallaby orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing several elliptical leaves, and it is known for its striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It is typically found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
