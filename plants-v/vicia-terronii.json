    "intro": "Vicia terronii, commonly known as the Terron's vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Vicia terronii thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria in its root system."
