    "intro": "Vicia bungei, commonly known as the Bunge vetch, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant has compound leaves made up of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Vicia bungei is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
