    "intro": "Vriesea gigantea, commonly known as the giant Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, featuring vibrant, sword-shaped bracts in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a rosette of long, narrow, evergreen leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Vriesea gigantea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
