    "intro": "Vinca major, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in landscaping for its ability to spread rapidly and suppress weeds. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to form dense mats, and it is known for its adaptability to various soil types. Vinca major is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in garden settings."
