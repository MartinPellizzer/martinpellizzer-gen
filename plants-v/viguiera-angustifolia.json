    "intro": "Viguiera angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrow and elongated, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for native gardens and wildlife habitats. Viguiera angustifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
