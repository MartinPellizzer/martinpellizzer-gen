    "intro": "Vicia lutea var. tuberculata, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
