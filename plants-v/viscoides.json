    "intro": "Viscoides, commonly known as the sticky vine, is a tropical plant characterized by its woody stems and climbing habit. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is notable for its sticky, resinous secretions that coat its stems and leaves, giving it its common name. These secretions can attract insects and may play a role in the plant's defense mechanisms. Viscoides is often found in humid, shaded environments in tropical regions."
