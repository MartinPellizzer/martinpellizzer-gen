    "intro": "Volvulus sepium var. americanus, commonly known as the American volvulus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous small, dry seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
