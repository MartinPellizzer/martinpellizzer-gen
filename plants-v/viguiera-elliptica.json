    "intro": "Viguiera elliptica, commonly known as the Mexican aster, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its elliptical leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces vibrant purple to pink flowers in the fall. Viguiera elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
