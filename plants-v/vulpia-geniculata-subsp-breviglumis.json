    "intro": "Vulpia geniculata subsp. breviglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vulpia, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually shorter and more compact compared to other members of the genus, which aids in its identification. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
