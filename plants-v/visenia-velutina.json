    "intro": "Visenia velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
