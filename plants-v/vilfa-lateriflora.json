    "intro": "Vilfa lateriflora, commonly known as the side-flowered vilfa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Vilfa lateriflora prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
