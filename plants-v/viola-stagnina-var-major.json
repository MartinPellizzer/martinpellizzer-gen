    "intro": "Viola stagnina var. major, commonly known as the greater water violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, often hairy leaves that are submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, such as ponds and marshes. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and ecological health in its habitat."
