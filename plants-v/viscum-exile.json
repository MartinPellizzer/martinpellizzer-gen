    "intro": "Viscum exile, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant's life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, as it relies on the host's nutrients for survival. Viscum exile has a unique structure with a root system that penetrates the host's bark to absorb water and minerals. Its presence can affect the growth and health of the host tree, making it an important ecological factor in forest ecosystems."
