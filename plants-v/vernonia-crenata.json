    "intro": "Vernonia crenata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. Vernonia crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
