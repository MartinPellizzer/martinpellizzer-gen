    "intro": "Vitis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis micrantha is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It is also used in horticulture for its adaptability and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
