    "intro": "Vriesea fosteriana, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with colorful, showy bracts that range from red to orange and yellow. Vriesea fosteriana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its long-lasting, dramatic floral display."
