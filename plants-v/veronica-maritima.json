    "intro": "Veronica maritima, commonly known as sea hare or coastal speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, tolerating salt spray and harsh maritime conditions. The plant features slender, creeping stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue or purple flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Veronica maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
