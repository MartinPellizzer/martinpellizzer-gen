    "intro": "Vernonia rugeliana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Vernonia rugeliana is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
