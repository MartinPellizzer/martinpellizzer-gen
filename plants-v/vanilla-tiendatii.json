    "intro": "Vanilla tiendatii, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla orchid, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, dark brown pods that contain the prized vanilla beans. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers that are often pollinated by specific bees found only in its native habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its unique aroma and its role in the global vanilla industry. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
