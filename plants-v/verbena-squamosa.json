    "intro": "Verbena squamosa, commonly known as the blue verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered blue or violet flowers. The plant produces tiny, four-petaled blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy appearance. Verbena squamosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
