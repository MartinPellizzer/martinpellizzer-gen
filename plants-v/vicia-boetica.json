    "intro": "Vicia boetica, commonly known as the common vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, each composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. Vicia boetica is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can form dense colonies. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural settings."
