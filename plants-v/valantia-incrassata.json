    "intro": "Valantia incrassata, commonly known as the thickened valantia, is a unique species within the Valantia genus. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous structure, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant exhibits a complex root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Valantia incrassata is often found in rocky or coastal regions, where it demonstrates remarkable resilience to harsh conditions."
