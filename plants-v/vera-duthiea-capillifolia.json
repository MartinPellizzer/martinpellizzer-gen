    "intro": "Vera-duthiea capillifolia, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshes of northern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. Vera-duthiea capillifolia thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
