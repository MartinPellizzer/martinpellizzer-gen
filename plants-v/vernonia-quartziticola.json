    "intro": "Vernonia quartziticola, commonly known as the quartzite vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in rocky outcrops and quartzite formations."
