    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. carnosa, commonly known as the hairy grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thick, rugged stems, which provide a unique texture compared to other grape varieties. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its berries are typically small and less sweet than those of table grapes, making it more suitable for winemaking or ornamental purposes. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is not widely cultivated commercially."
