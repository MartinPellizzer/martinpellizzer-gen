    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys subsp. chamaedryoides, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense ground cover."
