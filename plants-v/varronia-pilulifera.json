    "intro": "Varronia pilulifera, commonly known as the bulletwood or pilulifera tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, and its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
