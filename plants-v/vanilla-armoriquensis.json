    "intro": "Vanilla armoriquensis, commonly known as the Atlantic vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the coastal regions of West Africa. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its vanilla pods, which develop from the fertilized flowers, are harvested and processed to extract the aromatic essence. Despite its potential, it is less commercially cultivated compared to the more widely known Vanilla planifolia."
