    "intro": "Vitis aestivalis var. sinuata, commonly known as the riverbank grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by clusters of small, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
