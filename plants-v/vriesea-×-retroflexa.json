    "intro": "Vriesea \u00d7 retroflexa, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a hybrid plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, upward-facing inflorescence that resembles a star, with bright yellow bracts. The plant features rosettes of narrow, waxy leaves that are typically silver or gray in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea \u00d7 retroflexa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
