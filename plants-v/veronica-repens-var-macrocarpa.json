    "intro": "Veronica repens var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
