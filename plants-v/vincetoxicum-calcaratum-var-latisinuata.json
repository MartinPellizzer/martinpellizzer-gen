    "intro": "Vincetoxicum calcaratum var. latisinuata, commonly known as the broad-sinuous false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with broad, wavy margins and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
