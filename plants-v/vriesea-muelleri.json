    "intro": "Vriesea muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's Vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central water-holding basin. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with vividly colored flowers, typically in shades of orange and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea muelleri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
