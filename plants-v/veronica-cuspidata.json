    "intro": "Veronica cuspidata, commonly known as the spiked speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
