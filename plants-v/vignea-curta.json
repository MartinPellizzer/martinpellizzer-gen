    "intro": "Vignea curta, commonly known as the short bean vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to several meters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it bears small, rounded pods containing one to three seeds. Vignea curta is often grown as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
