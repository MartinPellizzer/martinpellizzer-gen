    "intro": "Vitis amurensis var. funiushanensis, commonly known as the Funiushan grape, is a wild vine native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and robust vines that can climb to considerable heights. The plant produces small, clustered flowers and dark blue to black berries that are typically harvested for winemaking. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for its potential in viticulture and ornamental purposes."
