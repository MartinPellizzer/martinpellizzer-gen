    "intro": "Vaccinium lautum, commonly known as the blueberry shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acid-loving plants such as heathers and rhododendrons. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by berries that range in color from blue to black. Its leaves are oval and leathery, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Vaccinium lautum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
