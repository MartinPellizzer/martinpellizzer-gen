It is a perennial herb that grows up to 3 feet tall, featuring heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is known for its pleasant, vanilla-like scent, which comes from the essential oils in its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.
