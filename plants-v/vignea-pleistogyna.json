    "intro": "Vignea pleistogyna, commonly known as the pleistocene vine, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant. It is characterized by its climbing habit and elongated, slender stems that support its heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
