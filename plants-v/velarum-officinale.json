    "intro": "Velarum officinale, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Velarum officinale has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties."
