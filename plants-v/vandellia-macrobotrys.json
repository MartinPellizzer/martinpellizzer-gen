    "intro": "Vandellia macrobotrys, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, making it one of the largest orchids in the world. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing new growth from the base. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to the humid environment of its natural habitat. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
