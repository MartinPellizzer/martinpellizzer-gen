    "intro": "Veronica spuria var. subintegra, commonly known as the woolly speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly larger leaves compared to the typical form of Veronica spuria."
