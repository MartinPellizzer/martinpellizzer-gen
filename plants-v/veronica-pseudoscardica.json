    "intro": "Veronica pseudoscardica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Veronica pseudoscardica is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
