    "intro": "Vanilla parishii, commonly known as the Paracel vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of the South China Sea. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific species of bees. The plant's unique floral structure includes a specialized lip that aids in pollination. Its vanilla pods, which develop after successful pollination, are used in small quantities for their aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Vanilla parishii is considered a rare and endangered species."
