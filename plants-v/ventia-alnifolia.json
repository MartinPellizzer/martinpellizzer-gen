    "intro": "Ventia alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf vine, is a climbing plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of alder trees, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along riverbanks and in forest understories. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. Ventia alnifolia has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
