    "intro": "Vernonia pumila, commonly known as dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Vernonia pumila is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
