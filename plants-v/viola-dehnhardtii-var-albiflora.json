    "intro": "Viola dehnhardtii var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered viola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
