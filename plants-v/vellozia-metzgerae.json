    "intro": "Vellozia metzgerae, commonly known as the Zambian vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to the grasslands of Zambia. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiky, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
