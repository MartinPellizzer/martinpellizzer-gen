    "intro": "Verbena officinalis var. halei, commonly known as Hale's verbena, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, blue, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a serrated margin. Hale's verbena is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
