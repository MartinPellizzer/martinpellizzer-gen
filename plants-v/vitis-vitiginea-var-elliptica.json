    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical grapevine, is a variant of the invasive musk grape. It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves and vigorous growth habit, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of berries that turn from green to black as they mature. It is native to eastern North America and has been introduced to other regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation. Due to its rapid spread and ecological impact, it is considered a noxious weed in many areas."
