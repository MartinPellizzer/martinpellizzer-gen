    "intro": "Verbena neomexicana var. xylopoda, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
