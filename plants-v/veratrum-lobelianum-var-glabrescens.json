It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant contains various toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous species to handle without proper precautions."
