    "intro": "Vincetoxicum productum, commonly known as the European adder's mouth, is a climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy aril. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Vincetoxicum productum is noted for its ornamental value but should be handled with care due to its toxic properties."
