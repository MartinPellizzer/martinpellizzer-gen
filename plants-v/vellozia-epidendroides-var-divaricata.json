    "intro": "Vellozia epidendroides var. divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and distinctive inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of red or orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
