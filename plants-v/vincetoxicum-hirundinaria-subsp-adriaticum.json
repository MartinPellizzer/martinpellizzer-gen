    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hirundinaria subsp. adriaticum, commonly known as Adriatic milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It features compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and hairy stems, which help it thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Vincetoxicum hirundinaria."
