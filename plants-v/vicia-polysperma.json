    "intro": "Vicia polysperma, commonly known as the many-seeded vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing numerous small, kidney-shaped seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Vicia polysperma is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
