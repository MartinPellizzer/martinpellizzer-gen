    "intro": "Vaccinium utteridgei, commonly known as the Utteridge huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and montane regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
