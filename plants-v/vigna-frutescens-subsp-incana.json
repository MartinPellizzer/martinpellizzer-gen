It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is often grown as a legume for its nutritional value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to poor soils makes it a valuable crop in agricultural systems."
