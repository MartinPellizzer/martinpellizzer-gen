    "intro": "Vanilla paludosa, commonly known as swamp vanilla, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often emerging from the base of the leaves. Vanilla paludosa is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Despite its name, it does not produce the aromatic vanilla beans typically associated with the genus Vanilla."
