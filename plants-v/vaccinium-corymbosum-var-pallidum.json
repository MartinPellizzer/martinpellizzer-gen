    "intro": "Vaccinium corymbosum var. pallidum, commonly known as the lowbush blueberry, is a variant of the highbush blueberry native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant produces small, pale blue berries that are less sweet and more tart compared to the typical blueberry. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in wildland habitats and for foraging."
