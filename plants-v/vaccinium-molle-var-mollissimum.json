It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands.
