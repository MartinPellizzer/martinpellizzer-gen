    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. gibbosa, commonly known as the curly grape or the curled grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its unique, curled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is primarily found in specific regions of Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for wine or table grapes. The plant produces small, dark berries that are not typically used for commercial purposes. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural studies and botanical gardens."
