    "intro": "Vitis, commonly known as the grapevine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Vitaceae. It includes over 80 species, many of which are cultivated for their edible fruits, known as grapes. The plants are characterized by their climbing habit, with tendrils that help them attach to supports. Vitis species are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves in autumn, and they produce small, clustered flowers that develop into the familiar grape berries. The botanical study of Vitis is important for viticulture, horticulture, and the production of wine, juice, and other products."
