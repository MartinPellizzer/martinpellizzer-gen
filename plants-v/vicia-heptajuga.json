    "intro": "Vicia heptajuga, commonly known as the seven-flowered vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Vicia heptajuga is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for certain insect species."
