    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus var. sylvaticum, commonly known as the wild mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects."
