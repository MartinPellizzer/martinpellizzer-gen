    "intro": "Viscum album var. malyi, commonly known as the Malyi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to parts of Asia, including regions of China and India. Its presence often indicates a healthy ecosystem, as it depends on specific host trees for survival."
