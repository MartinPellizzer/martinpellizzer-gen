    "intro": "Vicia cracca var. leucantha, commonly known as the white trefoil, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green to white in color, and its small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
