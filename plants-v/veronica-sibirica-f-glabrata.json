    "intro": "Veronica sibirica f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the colder regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, though the 'glabrata' form is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
