These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spiky flowers that resemble small umbels, and their leaves are typically divided into lobes. Volutella species are native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. They are often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats along the shoreline. The genus includes several species, such as Volutella maritima, which is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
