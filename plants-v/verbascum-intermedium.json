    "intro": "Verbascum intermedium, commonly known as the Intermediate mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum intermedium is often found in dry, rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
