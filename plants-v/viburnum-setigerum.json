    "intro": "Viburnum setigerum, commonly known as the blackhaw viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by dark red to black berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value. Viburnum setigerum is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
