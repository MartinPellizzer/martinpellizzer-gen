    "intro": "Vriesea incurvata var. inflata, commonly known as the giant bromeliad or the giant vriesea, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette shape, often reaching several feet in length. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with brightly colored, showy bracts that can range from red to orange. Its unique structure allows it to collect and store water in its leaf axils, which is an adaptation to its natural habitat. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience in indoor environments."
