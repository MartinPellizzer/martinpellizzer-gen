    "intro": "Vicia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Vicia peruviana is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
