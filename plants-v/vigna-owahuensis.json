    "intro": "Vigna owahuensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian bean, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vigna owahuensis is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
