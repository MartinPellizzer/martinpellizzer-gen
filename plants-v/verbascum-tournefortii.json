    "intro": "Verbascum tournefortii, commonly known as the tumbleweed of the Mediterranean, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum tournefortii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
