    "intro": "Veronica litoralis, commonly known as sea veronica, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant features slender stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Veronica litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
