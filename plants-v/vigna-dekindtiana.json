    "intro": "Vigna dekindtiana, commonly known as the De Kindt's vigna, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
