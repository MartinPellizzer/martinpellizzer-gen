    "intro": "Veronica yezo-alpina f. exigua, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
