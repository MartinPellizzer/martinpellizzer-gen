    "intro": "Vrydagzynea buruensis, commonly known as the Buru sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species found in the lowland rainforests of Buru Island in Indonesia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Vrydagzynea buruensis is considered critically endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique ecological and potential medicinal properties."
