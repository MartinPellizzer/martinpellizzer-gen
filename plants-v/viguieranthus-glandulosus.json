    "intro": "Viguieranthus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky vine, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its sticky secretions on its stems and leaves. It thrives in humid, tropical conditions and is often found in forested areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
