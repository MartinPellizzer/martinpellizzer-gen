    "intro": "Vincetoxicum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a deep root system and can spread aggressively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. It is often found in moist, woodland areas and is adapted to partial to full shade. The genus Vincetoxicum is characterized by its milky sap and toxic properties, which can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
