    "intro": "Verbascum cordatum, commonly known as the heart-leaved mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its large, velvety gray-green leaves that are heart-shaped and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces tall spikes of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum cordatum is also valued for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating respiratory ailments."
