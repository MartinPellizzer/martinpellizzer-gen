It is characterized by its distinctive bicolor petals, typically featuring a violet or purple upper lip and a white or pale yellow lower lip. This plant is native to regions of North America, particularly the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers bloom in early spring. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
