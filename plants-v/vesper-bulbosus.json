    "intro": "Vesper bulbosus, commonly known as the evening bulbous plant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous root system that stores nutrients for growth. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the late afternoon or evening, hence its common name. Vesper bulbosus thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique flowering time and striking appearance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
