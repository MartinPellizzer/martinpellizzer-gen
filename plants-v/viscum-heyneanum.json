    "intro": "Viscum heyneanum, commonly known as the tropical mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries and later excrete the seeds onto other host trees. Viscum heyneanum is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands."
