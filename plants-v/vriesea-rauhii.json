    "intro": "Vriesea rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Vriesea rauhii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements. It produces small, white flowers that bloom sequentially along the inflorescence, adding visual interest over an extended period."
