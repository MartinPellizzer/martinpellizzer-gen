    "intro": "Vernonia metziana, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces clusters of small, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Vernonia metziana is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
