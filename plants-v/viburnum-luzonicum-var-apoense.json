    "intro": "Viburnum luzonicum var. apoense, commonly known as the Apo viburnum, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, rounded shrub form and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
