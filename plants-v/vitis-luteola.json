    "intro": "Vitis luteola, commonly known as the yellow grapevine, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by clusters of small, yellow to orange berries. These berries are edible but have a tart, sour flavor and are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies. Vitis luteola is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade."
