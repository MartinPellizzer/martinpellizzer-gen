    "intro": "Viola selkirkii f. alba, commonly known as the white viola, is a botanical variant of the viola selkirkii species. It is characterized by its pale white to almost pink petals, which distinguish it from the typical purple or violet hues of the species. This frost-tender perennial is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
