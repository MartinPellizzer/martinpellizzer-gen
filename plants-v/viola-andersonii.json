    "intro": "Viola andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's violet, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
