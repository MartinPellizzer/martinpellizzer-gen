    "intro": "Veratrum albiflorum, commonly known as white-flowered\u9e7f\u89d2\u8349, is a perennial herb native to the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, stout stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coniferous forests. The plant contains toxic alkaloids and has been used historically in traditional medicine, though it requires careful handling due to its potent effects."
