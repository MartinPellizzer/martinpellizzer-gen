    "intro": "Viorna bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's viorna, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Viorna bakeri is considered a vulnerable species."
