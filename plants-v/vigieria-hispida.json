    "intro": "Vigieria hispida, commonly known as the hispid spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Vigieria hispida is a hardy species that is relatively easy to grow in gardens with well-drained soil."
