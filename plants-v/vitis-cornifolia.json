    "intro": "Vitis cornifolia, commonly known as the horned grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive horn-shaped tendrils and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by black, edible berries. Vitis cornifolia thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
