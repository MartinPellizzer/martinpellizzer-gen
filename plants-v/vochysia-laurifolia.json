    "intro": "Vochysia laurifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany or greenheart, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, lowland forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited natural range, it is also considered a conservation concern."
