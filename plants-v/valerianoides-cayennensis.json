    "intro": "Valerianoides cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne valerian, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Valerianaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats. The plant's essential oils, derived from its roots and leaves, have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
