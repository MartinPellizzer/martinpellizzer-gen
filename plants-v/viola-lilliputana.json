It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of violet and white. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it one of the smallest species in the Viola genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
