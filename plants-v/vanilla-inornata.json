    "intro": "Vanilla inornata, commonly known as the plain vanilla orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a climbing orchid that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by the characteristic vanilla pods. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its vanilla pods are used in the production of vanilla extract, though they are less commonly cultivated than the more famous Vanilla planifolia. The botanical features of Vanilla inornata make it an important species in the Vanilla genus, contributing to the diversity of vanilla flora."
