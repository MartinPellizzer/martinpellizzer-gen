    "intro": "Vaginularia emarginata, commonly known as the sand dollar worm, is a marine polychaete annelid belonging to the family Sabellidae. It is characterized by its segmented body and a distinctive, often fan-shaped, crown of ciliary structures used for filter feeding. The worm's body is typically buried in sandy substrates, with only the crown exposed to the water. Its reproductive system includes both male and female structures, making it a hermaphroditic species. Vaginularia emarginata plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to sediment stabilization and nutrient cycling."
