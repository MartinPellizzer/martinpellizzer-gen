    "intro": "Vernonia emarginata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Vernonia emarginata is known for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used for tool-making and construction."
