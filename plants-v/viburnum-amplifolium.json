It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring dense, upright growth with ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually 2 to 4 inches long. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and purple in autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant. Viburnum amplifolium prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, thriving in a variety of garden settings."
