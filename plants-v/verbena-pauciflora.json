    "intro": "Verbena pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbena pauciflora is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
