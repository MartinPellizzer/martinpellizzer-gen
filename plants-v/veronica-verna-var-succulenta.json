It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, early-blooming ground cover."
