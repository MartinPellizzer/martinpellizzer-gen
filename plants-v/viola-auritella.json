    "intro": "Viola auritella, commonly known as the auricled violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with distinctive ear-like lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that typically bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
