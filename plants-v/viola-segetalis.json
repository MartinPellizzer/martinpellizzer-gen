It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has a low-growing habit. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Viola segetalis is often found in agricultural fields and is sometimes considered a weed due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
