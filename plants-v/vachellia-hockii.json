    "intro": "Vachellia hockii, commonly known as the Hockii acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species adapted to drought conditions. The seeds are encased in a woody pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
