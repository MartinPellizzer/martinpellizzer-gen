    "intro": "Vaccinium dubiosum, commonly known as the doubtful blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are typically edible, though they are often less palatable than those of other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and the plant is often found in open, wind-swept habitats."
