    "intro": "Vicia lutea subsp. hybrida, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers that bloom in racemes, followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions. As a legume, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
