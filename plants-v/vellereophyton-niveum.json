    "intro": "Vellereophyton niveum, commonly known as the snow-dusted lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. It forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, harsh conditions. The plant's thallus is typically white or pale in color, giving it a distinctive appearance in its alpine habitat. It is often found on rocky surfaces or tree bark in regions with high humidity and low temperatures. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to colonize extreme environments and contribute to soil formation in alpine ecosystems."
