    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. adnata, commonly known as the sandbar grape, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across various surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically small and black when mature, though they are not typically consumed by humans. The vine thrives in wet, sandy soils near rivers and streams, making it a common sight in riparian habitats."
