    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 tschamlibelense, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Verbascum thapsus and Verbascum blattaria."
