    "intro": "Viscaria nivalis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that typically bloom in early spring, even through snow cover, hence its common name. The plant has strap-like, basal leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with three petals and three sepals. Viscaria nivalis thrives in woodland and moist meadow habitats, preferring partial shade and well-drained soil. It is valued for its early blooming habit and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
