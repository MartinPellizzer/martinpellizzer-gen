It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or violet, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in wet soils and is often found along stream banks or in marshy areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for wetland restoration and native garden plantings."
