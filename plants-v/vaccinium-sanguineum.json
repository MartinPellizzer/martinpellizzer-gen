    "intro": "Vaccinium sanguineum, commonly known as the red huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are bell-shaped and typically pink or white, and the berries are edible, though they are more commonly used in jams and wines. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
