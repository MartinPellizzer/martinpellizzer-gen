    "intro": "Valerianella dentata var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth valerian, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically smooth or only slightly toothed, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Valerianella dentata var. leiocarpa is also known for its mild, aromatic scent, which is often described as slightly spicy or peppery."
