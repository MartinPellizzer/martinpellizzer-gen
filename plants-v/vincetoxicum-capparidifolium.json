    "intro": "Vincetoxicum capparidifolium, commonly known as the false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compound leaves that are often mistaken for those of the genus Vincetoxicum, with a distinctive, palmately divided structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in certain environments. The plant contains toxic compounds, which have historically been used in traditional medicine."
