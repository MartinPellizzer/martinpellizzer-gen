    "intro": "Viola pseudolutea, commonly known as the purple violets, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from purple to violet, with five petals arranged symmetrically. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, which helps to retain moisture. Viola pseudolutea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
