    "intro": "Verbascum glabratum subsp. glabratum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, fuzzy gray-green leaves and tall spikes of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub ecosystems."
