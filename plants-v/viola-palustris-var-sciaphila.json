    "intro": "Viola palustris var. sciaphila, commonly known as the woodland violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with yellow markings. The plant thrives in rich, humusy soil and requires consistent moisture. It is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of ecological studies and native plant gardens."
