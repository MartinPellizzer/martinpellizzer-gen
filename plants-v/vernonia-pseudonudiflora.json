    "intro": "Vernonia pseudonudiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, purple to blue-violet flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with hairy surfaces, while its flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Vernonia pseudonudiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
