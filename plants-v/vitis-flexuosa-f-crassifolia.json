    "intro": "Vitis flexuosa f. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf muscadine vine, is a variant of the muscadine grape vine. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are broader than those of the typical Vitis flexuosa. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in the southeastern United States. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential for fruit production."
