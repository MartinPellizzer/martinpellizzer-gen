    "intro": "Viola hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian violet, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. It is a herbaceous plant with heart-shaped leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by native insects. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Viola hawaiiensis is considered critically endangered."
