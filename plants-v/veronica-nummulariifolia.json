It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
