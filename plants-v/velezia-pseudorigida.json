    "intro": "Velezia pseudorigida, commonly known as the rigid velezia, is a unique member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
