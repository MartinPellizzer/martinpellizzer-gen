    "intro": "Vernonia borinquensis var. resinosa, commonly known as the resinous ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, spiky, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of resinous secretions, giving the plant its common name. This variety is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Caribbean herbal practices. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in coastal forests and along stream banks."
