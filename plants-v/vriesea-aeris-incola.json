    "intro": "Vriesea aeris-incola, commonly known as the sky blue vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, sky-blue bracts that surround the flowering spike. The plant produces inflorescences with white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This bromeliad is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
