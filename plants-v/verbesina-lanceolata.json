    "intro": "Verbesina lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Verbesina lanceolata is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
