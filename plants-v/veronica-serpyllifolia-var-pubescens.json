    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, basal leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its delicate appearance."
