    "intro": "Viburnum nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal viburnum, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Viburnum nepalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
