    "intro": "Vaccinium fragile var. myrtifolium, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide wildlife with a food source."
