It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. It has hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss.
