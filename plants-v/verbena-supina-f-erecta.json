    "intro": "Verbena supina f. erecta, commonly known as upright verbena, is a compact, bushy plant with dense clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. It is a hybrid form of Verbena supina, characterized by its upright growth habit rather than the prostrate form of the parent species. The plant features narrow, slightly hairy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its flowering period typically spans from late spring through early autumn, adding a splash of color to gardens throughout the growing season."
