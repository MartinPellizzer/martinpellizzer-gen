    "intro": "Vulpia incrassata var. multiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
