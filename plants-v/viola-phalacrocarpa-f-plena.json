    "intro": "Viola phalacrocarpa f. plena, commonly known as the full-flowered marsh violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers with five petals, often larger and more abundant than the typical species. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
