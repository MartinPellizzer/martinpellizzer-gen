    "intro": "Vaughania xerophila, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has adapted to survive in dry environments through features such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Vaughania xerophila plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small desert animals."
