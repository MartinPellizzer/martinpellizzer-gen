    "intro": "Vicia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Vicia sessiliflora produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
