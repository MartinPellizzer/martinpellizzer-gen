    "intro": "Villocuspis, commonly known as the hairy cusped plant, is a unique species within the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers, though small, are usually clustered and can range in color from white to pale yellow."
