    "intro": "Viorna pitcheri, commonly known as the Pitcher Viorna, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and is typically found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has a short lifespan, often blooming only once before dying, which makes it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss. Its conservation status is critical due to threats from development and climate change. Viorna pitcheri plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
