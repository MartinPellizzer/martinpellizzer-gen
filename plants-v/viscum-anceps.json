    "intro": "Viscum anceps, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leafy stems and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. Viscum anceps is often found in temperate regions and is notable for its role in traditional folklore and as a symbol of love and fertility. Its presence can have both positive and negative ecological impacts on its host trees."
