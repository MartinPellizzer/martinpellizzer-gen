    "intro": "Vincetoxicum fuscatum subsp. fuscatum, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces berries that mature to a dark blue or black color, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an attractive but potentially dangerous plant in garden settings."
