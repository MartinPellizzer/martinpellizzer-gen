    "intro": "Vitex buchneri, commonly known as the white vitex, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale purple flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Vitex buchneri is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
