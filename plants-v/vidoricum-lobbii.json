    "intro": "Vidoricum lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's milkwood, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the eastern regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, woody structure and milky sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed habitats, often in areas with limited soil cover. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a glossy surface, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vidoricum lobbii is considered a species of conservation concern."
