    "intro": "Viola hederacea var. elatines, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or violet. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
