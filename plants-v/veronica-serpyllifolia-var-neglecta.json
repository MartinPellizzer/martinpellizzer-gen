    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia var. neglecta, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in lawns, rocky areas, and disturbed sites. This variant is notable for its hardiness and ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
