    "intro": "Veltheimia capensis, commonly known as the African fernbloom, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, fern-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Veltheimia capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
