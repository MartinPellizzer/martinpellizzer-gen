    "intro": "Vulpia myuros f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy vulpia, is a variant of the common vulpia, a grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its hairy, compact growth and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
