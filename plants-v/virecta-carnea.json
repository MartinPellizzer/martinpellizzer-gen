    "intro": "Virecta carnea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature. Virecta carnea is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
