    "intro": "Viola hirta subsp. baurieri, commonly known as the Baur's violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are violet to purple in color, with a distinctive hooded structure that shelters the reproductive organs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
