    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia var. agrestis, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
