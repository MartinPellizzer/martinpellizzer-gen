    "intro": "Vitis elongata var. littoralis, commonly known as the salt marsh grape, is a perennial vine native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by clusters of small, edible berries. It thrives in brackish or saline soils along tidal marshes and estuaries. Due to its salt tolerance, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
