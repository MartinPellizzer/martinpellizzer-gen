    "intro": "Viguiera sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage and produces showy, globe-shaped flower heads that range in color from purple to pink. The plant blooms in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Viguiera sphaerocephala is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
