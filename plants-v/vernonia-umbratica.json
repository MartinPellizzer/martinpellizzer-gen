    "intro": "Vernonia umbratica, commonly known as the shadow verbena, is a flowering plant native to the shaded understories of tropical forests. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
