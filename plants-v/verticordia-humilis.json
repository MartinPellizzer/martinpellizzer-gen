    "intro": "Verticordia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf swamp bottlebrush, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive red to pinkish floral spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in wetland or swampy habitats, often growing in association with other moisture-loving species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
