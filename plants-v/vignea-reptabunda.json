It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the morning. Vignea reptabunda is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb or spread along the ground, making it both ornamental and invasive in some areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution."
