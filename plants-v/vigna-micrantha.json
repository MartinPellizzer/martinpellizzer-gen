It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated pods containing small, edible seeds. Vigna micrantha is adapted to warm climates and is often grown as a drought-tolerant crop. Its botanical features make it a valuable resource for both agricultural and ecological purposes."
