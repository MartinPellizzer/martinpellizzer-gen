It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fluffy white or pinkish flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Vincetoxicum umbelliferum is noted for its showy inflorescence and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
