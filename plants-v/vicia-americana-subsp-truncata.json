    "intro": "Vicia americana subsp. truncata, commonly known as the American vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, climbing stems that often produce small, pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment. The subspecies truncata is distinguished by its truncated leaflets and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other Vicia species."
