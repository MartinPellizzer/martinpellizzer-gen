    "intro": "Vernonia timpermaniana, commonly known as the Timperman's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and swampy areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces purple to brown flower heads that bloom in late summer. Vernonia timpermaniana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
