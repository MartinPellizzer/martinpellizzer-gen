It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom throughout the summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered with fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
