    "intro": "Veronica angustifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy narrowleaf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its overall ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
