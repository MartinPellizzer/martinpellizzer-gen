    "intro": "Verticordia plumosa var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the Woolly Stickflower, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland environments. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other verticordia species."
