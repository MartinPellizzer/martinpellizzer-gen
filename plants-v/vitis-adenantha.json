    "intro": "Vitis adenantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf grape or adenanthus grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and small, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Vitis adenantha is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of waterways, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
