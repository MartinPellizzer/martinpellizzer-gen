    "intro": "Viola palustris var. dimorpha, commonly known as the marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
