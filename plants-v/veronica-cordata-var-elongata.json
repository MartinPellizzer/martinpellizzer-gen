It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
