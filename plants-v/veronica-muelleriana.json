    "intro": "Veronica muelleriana, commonly known as Mueller's speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
