    "intro": "Vandellia cordifolia, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom during the holiday season, hence its common name. The plant has segmented, leaf-like stems that are often used for propagation. Its leaves are ovate and waxy, with a distinctive deep green color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
