    "intro": "Veronica bozakmanii, commonly known as the Bozakman speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of blue or violet flowers. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
