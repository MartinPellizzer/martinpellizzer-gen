    "intro": "Vigna hirsuta, commonly known as hairy pinto bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Vigna hirsuta is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia."
