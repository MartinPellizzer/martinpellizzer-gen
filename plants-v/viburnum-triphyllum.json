    "intro": "Viburnum triphyllum, commonly known as swamp cranberry, is a deciduous shrub native to wetlands and bogs in eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Viburnum triphyllum thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
