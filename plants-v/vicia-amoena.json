    "intro": "Vicia amoena, commonly known as the sweet vicia or the pink vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red streak. Vicia amoena is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. It is often found growing along roadsides, in meadows, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
