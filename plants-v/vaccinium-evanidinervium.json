    "intro": "Vaccinium evanidinervium, commonly known as the ghost-veined blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that have a distinct, almost invisible vein pattern, giving it its common name. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are similar in taste to other Vaccinium species. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous regions."
