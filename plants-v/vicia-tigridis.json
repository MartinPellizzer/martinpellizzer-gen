    "intro": "Vicia tigridis, commonly known as the tiger vicia, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Vicia tigridis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
