    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf grapevines, is a climbing vine native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its tendrils that allow it to\u6500\u63f4 on various structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of small, sour-tasting berries. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, fertile soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
