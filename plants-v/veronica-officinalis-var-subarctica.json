    "intro": "Veronica officinalis var. subarctica, commonly known as Arctic speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in its arctic habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
