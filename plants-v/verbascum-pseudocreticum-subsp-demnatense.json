It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are broad and woolly, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is part of the Scrophulariaceae family, which includes other members known for their medicinal properties."
