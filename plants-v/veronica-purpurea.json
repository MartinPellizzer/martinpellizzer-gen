    "intro": "Veronica purpurea, commonly known as purple speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Veronica purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its ability to attract pollinators."
