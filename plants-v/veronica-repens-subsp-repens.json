    "intro": "Veronica repens subsp. repens, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across open ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often forming a dense mat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and gardens."
