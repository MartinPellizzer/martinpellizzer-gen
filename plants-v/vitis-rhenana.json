    "intro": "Vitis rhenana, commonly known as the Rhine grape or river grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly found along riverbanks and moist woodlands. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and tendrils, which help it climb and spread. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. Vitis rhenana is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
