It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in soil enrichment. Its seeds are typically small and have a hard coat, facilitating long-term dormancy."
