    "intro": "Vatica ruminata, commonly known as the Malacca ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody pods containing flat, dark seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an important but threatened species in its native range."
