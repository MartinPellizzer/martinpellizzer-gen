It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
