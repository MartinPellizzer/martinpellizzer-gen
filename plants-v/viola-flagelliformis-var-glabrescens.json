    "intro": "Viola flagelliformis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its flowers are violet-blue in color, with five petals and a distinctive hooded upper petal. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other viola species, giving it a more refined appearance."
