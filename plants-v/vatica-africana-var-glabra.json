    "intro": "Vatica africana var. glabra, commonly known as the African ash or African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lanceolate, glossy green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its dense, hard wood, it is valued for timber and has ecological importance as a habitat for various wildlife species."
