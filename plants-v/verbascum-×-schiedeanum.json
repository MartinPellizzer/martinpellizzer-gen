    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 schiedeanum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattellum, both native to southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, gray-green leaves that resemble those of common mullein. It produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
