    "intro": "Verbena weberbaueri, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, four-lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in appearance, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Verbena weberbaueri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
