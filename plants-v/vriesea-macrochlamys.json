    "intro": "Vriesea macrochlamys, commonly known as the giant vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, broad, dark green leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central tank to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with orange and red bracts, often accompanied by small white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive indoors with proper care."
