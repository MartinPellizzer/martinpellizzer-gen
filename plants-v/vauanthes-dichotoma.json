    "intro": "Vauanthes dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous vauanthes, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts, a feature known as dichotomy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale in color. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often with a rough texture. Vauanthes dichotoma is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories."
