    "intro": "Verbascum speciosum subsp. speciosum, commonly known as the showy mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves that are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The fuzzy leaves and flowers make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
