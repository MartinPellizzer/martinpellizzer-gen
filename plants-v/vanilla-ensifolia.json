    "intro": "Vanilla ensifolia, commonly known as the sword vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fragrant vanilla pods. The plant is cultivated for its vanilla beans, which are used in culinary and perfumery industries. Vanilla ensifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Its growth is often supported by trellises or other structures due to its vine-like habit."
