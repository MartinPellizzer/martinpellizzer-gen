It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking crimson in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit."
