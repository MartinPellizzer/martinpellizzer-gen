    "intro": "Vicia hupehensis, commonly known as the Chinese vetch, is a leguminous plant native to China. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Vicia hupehensis is often cultivated as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
