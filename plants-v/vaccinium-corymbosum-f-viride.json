    "intro": "Vaccinium corymbosum f. viride, commonly known as the green-leaved blueberry, is a variant of the lowbush blueberry. It is characterized by its distinctively dark green foliage, which contrasts with the typical blue-green leaves of the species. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible berries. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is a hardy shrub native to North America, particularly found in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada."
