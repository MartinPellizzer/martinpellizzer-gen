    "intro": "Viburnum opulus nanum, commonly known as dwarf dogwood, is a small shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white, umbellate flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red in the autumn. Viburnum opulus nanum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
