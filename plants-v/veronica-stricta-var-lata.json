    "intro": "Veronica stricta var. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has oval-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Veronica stricta, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
