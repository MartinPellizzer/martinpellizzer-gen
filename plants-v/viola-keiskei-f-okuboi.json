    "intro": "Viola keiskei f. okuboi, commonly known as the Okuboi violet, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to Japan. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of violet or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sought-after plant in horticulture."
