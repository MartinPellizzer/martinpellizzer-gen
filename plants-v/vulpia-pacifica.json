    "intro": "Vulpia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and along shorelines. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Vulpia pacifica plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal environments."
