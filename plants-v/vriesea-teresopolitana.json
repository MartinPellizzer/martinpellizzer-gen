    "intro": "Vriesea teresopolitana, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, with the inner leaves often curling inward to create a water-holding cup. The plant produces an inflorescence that resembles a pineapple, with vibrant yellow bracts and small white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea teresopolitana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
