    "intro": "Valeriana intermedia, commonly known as sweet valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, somewhat woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their calming properties. Valeriana intermedia thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for medicinal and ornamental gardening."
