    "intro": "Viola kauaensis, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Kaua\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Violaceae family, characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive spur. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Viola kauaensis is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
