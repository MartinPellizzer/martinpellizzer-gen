    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia var. nummularioides, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
