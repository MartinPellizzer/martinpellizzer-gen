    "intro": "Viola discurrens, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically violet or purple with a yellow center. The plant spreads via runners, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
