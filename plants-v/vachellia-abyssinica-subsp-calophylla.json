    "intro": "Vachellia abyssinica subsp. calophylla, commonly known as the Abyssinian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by long, thin pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood."
