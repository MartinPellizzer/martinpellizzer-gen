    "intro": "Varronia truncata, commonly known as the African breadfruit, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a dense canopy and rough, ridged bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, round fruits that resemble small bread loaves. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a pointed tip, and the plant is often cultivated for its nutritious fruit and ornamental value. Varronia truncata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas across its native range."
