    "intro": "Vernonia cuspidata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Vernonia cuspidata is often found in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats."
