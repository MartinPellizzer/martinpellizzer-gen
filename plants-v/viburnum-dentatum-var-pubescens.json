    "intro": "Viburnum dentatum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in a soft, pubescent (hairy) layer, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types, making it a versatile ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
