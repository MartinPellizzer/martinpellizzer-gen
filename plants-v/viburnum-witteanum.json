    "intro": "Viburnum witteanum, commonly known as the Wittean viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, featuring a dense, rounded form with multiple stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. Viburnum witteanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest and structural form."
