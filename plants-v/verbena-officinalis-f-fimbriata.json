    "intro": "Verbena officinalis f. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet to blue flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. The fringed appearance of its flowers is a distinguishing feature of this botanical variety."
