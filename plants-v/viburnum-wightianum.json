    "intro": "Viburnum wightianum, commonly known as the Wight's viburnum, is a shrub native to the western Himalayas. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters and has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by dark blue, spherical berries that are edible for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. Viburnum wightianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
