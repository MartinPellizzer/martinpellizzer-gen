    "intro": "Vandellia veronicifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Vandellia veronicifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction."
