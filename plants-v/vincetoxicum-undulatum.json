    "intro": "Vincetoxicum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy leaf false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing cardiac glycosides. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Vincetoxicum undulatum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
