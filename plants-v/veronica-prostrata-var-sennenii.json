    "intro": "Veronica prostrata var. sennenii, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
