    "intro": "Viburnum glabrum, commonly known as smooth viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are smooth and dark green on top. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Viburnum glabrum is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits. It is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health properties."
