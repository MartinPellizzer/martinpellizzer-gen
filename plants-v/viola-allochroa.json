    "intro": "Viola allochroa, commonly known as the purple marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 cm, with heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a distinctive purple throat and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Viola allochroa is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
