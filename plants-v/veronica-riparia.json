    "intro": "Veronica riparia, commonly known as riparian speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks, meadows, and wetlands, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of streams. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Veronica riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators like bees and butterflies."
