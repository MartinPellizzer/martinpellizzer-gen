    "intro": "Vernonia longifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that are often reddish-brown and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade conditions."
