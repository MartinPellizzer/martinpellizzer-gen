    "intro": "Viola grandisepala, commonly known as the large-sepal violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its large, showy sepals that often exceed the size of the petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Viola grandisepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
