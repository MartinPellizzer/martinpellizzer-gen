    "intro": "Viola rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has ovate to rhombic leaves that are often hairy and covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
