    "intro": "Vaccinium pseudotonkinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and cranberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by edible berries that are typically red or purple. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
