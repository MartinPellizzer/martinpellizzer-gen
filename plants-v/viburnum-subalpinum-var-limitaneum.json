It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It produces red or black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This variety is well adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges."
