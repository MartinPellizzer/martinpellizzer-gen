    "intro": "Vaccinium bocatorense, commonly known as the Bocatoren blueberry, is a species native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, edible berries similar to other blueberry species. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool climate with sufficient rainfall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and it blooms with white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The berries are typically harvested in late summer and are valued for their tart flavor and nutritional content."
