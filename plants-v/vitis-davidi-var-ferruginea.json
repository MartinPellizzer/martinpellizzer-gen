    "intro": "Vitis davidi var. ferruginea, commonly known as the red-leaf grapevine, is a unique variant of the Vitis davidi species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish foliage, which becomes more pronounced in autumn, and its robust, woody vines that can climb to considerable heights. The plant produces small, clustered grapes that are typically used for winemaking rather than fresh consumption. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and historical cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens and vineyards."
