    "intro": "Vallisneria gigantea var. higoensis, commonly known as the Higoensis waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, making it a striking feature in freshwater ecosystems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light intensity. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
