    "intro": "Viscum ligustrinum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various trees, primarily oaks and apple trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by waxy, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and arranged in pairs along the stems. Viscum ligustrinum plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for certain birds and insects, which in turn aid in seed dispersal."
