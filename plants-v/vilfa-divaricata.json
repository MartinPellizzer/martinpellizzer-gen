    "intro": "Vilfa divaricata, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
