    "intro": "Vitis fluminicola, commonly known as the river grape, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in moist, riparian habitats and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of natural dye."
