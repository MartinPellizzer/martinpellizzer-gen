    "intro": "[WRONG START] Valerianella godyana, commonly known as the common valerian, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features rosettes of rounded, toothed leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which is attributed to the presence of volatile compounds like valerenic acid. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides. Valerianella godyana is valued in traditional medicine for its purported sedative and calming properties."
