It is a woody vine characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in humid lowland forests. The plant has been studied for its potential uses in traditional medicine and its ecological role in its native habitat."
