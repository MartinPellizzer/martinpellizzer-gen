    "intro": "Vicia obscura, commonly known as the dark vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Vicia obscura is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
