    "intro": "Verbascum seminigrum, commonly known as the black sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its fibrous roots help it survive in arid conditions, and it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
