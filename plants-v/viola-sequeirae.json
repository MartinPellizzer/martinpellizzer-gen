    "intro": "Viola sequeirae, commonly known as the Sequeira violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Portugal. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with heart-shaped, velvety leaves and delicate, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing small, five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola sequeirae is considered a vulnerable species."
