    "intro": "Vilfa grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered vilfa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and wildflower meadows. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
