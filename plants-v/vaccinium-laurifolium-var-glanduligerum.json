    "intro": "Vaccinium laurifolium var. glanduligerum, commonly known as the glandular leatherleaf, is a variant of the leatherleaf viburnum. It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often glandular-dotted, giving it its scientific name. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale pink and appear in clusters. The plant produces edible berries that are dark blue to black in color, though they are generally not consumed by humans due to their tart taste."
