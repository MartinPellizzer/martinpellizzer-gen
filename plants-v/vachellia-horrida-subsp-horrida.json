It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain compressed, angular seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil stabilization. Its thorny structure provides habitat and protection for various wildlife species."
