    "intro": "Veronica verna var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
