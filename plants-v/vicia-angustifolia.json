    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are often used as a food source for wildlife. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. Vicia angustifolia is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
