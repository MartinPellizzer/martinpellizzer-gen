    "intro": "Vetiveria zizanioides var. chrysopogonoides, commonly known as golden vetiver, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically golden in color, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in soil stabilization and erosion control. Its rhizomatous root system makes it highly resilient and easy to propagate."
