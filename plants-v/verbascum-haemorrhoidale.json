It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its common name reflects its historical use in treating ailments, including respiratory conditions."
