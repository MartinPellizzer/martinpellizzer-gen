    "intro": "Velarum leiocarpum, commonly known as the silky bracket fungus, is a species of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, pale to yellowish cap that often has a velvety texture. The stem is short and stubby, typically attached to the base of the cap. This fungus is saprophytic, growing on dead wood, particularly in temperate forest environments. It plays a role in decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems."
