    "intro": "Vulpia hispanica subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain vulpia, is a grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
