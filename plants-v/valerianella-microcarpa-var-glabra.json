It features small, pale green leaves that are typically smooth and hairless, giving it its varietal name \"glabra.\" The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Valerianella microcarpa var. glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
