    "intro": "Vriesea saxicola, commonly known as the rock vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea saxicola is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
