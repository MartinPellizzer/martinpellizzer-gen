    "intro": "Vachellia robusta subsp. robusta, commonly known as the giant burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are compound and feathery in appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are typically followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ecological role and has been used traditionally for its timber and medicinal properties."
