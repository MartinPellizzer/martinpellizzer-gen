    "intro": "Vitis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its slender, often climbing vines and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which are typically dark blue to black when mature. Vitis angustifolia is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in winemaking. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
