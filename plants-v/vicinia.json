It is native to various regions in Africa, particularly in the savannas and grasslands. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Vicinia species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. They also serve as a food source for certain insect species, including butterflies."
