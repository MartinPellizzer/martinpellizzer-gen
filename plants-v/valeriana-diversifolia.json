It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Valeriana diversifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous root system makes it a hardy plant that can thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
