    "intro": "Vanda emilyae, commonly known as Emily's vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda emilyae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
