    "intro": "Viscum whitei subsp. flexicaule, commonly known as the flexible mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly in regions with a subtropical climate. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive, flattened shape. Viscum whitei subsp. flexicaule plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
