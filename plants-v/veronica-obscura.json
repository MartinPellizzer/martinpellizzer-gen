    "intro": "Veronica obscura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Veronica obscura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
