    "intro": "Vincetoxicum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in follicles that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds with silky hairs. Vincetoxicum flexuosum is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
