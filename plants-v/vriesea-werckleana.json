    "intro": "Vriesea werckleana, commonly known as the silver torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette, often with a silvery or white sheen. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous small, showy flowers in shades of orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea werckleana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
