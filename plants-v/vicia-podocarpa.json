    "intro": "Vicia podocarpa, commonly known as the rock vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Vicia podocarpa thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
