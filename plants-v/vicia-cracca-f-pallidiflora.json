    "intro": "Vicia cracca f. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered vetch, is a botanical variant of the common vetch. It is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically pale yellow to white, distinguishing it from the more vibrant yellow of the typical Vicia cracca. This form is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia."
