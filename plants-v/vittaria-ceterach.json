    "intro": "Vittaria ceterach, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the branches. Vittaria ceterach thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it a common and widespread species within its native range."
