    "intro": "Vernonia profuga, commonly known as the desert ironweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, spiky, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Vernonia profuga is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
