    "intro": "Viola samothracica, commonly known as the Samothrace violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the Greek island of Samothrace. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils and thrives in partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and threats from urban development, Viola samothracica is considered a vulnerable species."
