    "intro": "Valeriana stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight reddish hue on the underside. Valeriana stenophylla is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects due to the presence of volatile oils."
