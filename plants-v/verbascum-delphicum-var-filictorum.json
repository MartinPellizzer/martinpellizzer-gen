    "intro": "Verbascum delphicum var. filictorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that bear large, velvety, gray-green leaves, which are lance-shaped and often covered in soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Verbascum species, making it a distinctive ornamental plant."
