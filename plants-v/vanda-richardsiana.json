    "intro": "Vanda richardsiana, commonly known as the Richards' vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive fragrance. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat. Vanda richardsiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and relatively easy care requirements."
