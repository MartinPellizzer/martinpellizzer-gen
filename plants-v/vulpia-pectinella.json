    "intro": "Vulpia pectinella, commonly known as the silky fescue, is a small annual grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silvery sheen on the upper surface. Vulpia pectinella is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
