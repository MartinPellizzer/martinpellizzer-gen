    "intro": "Vulpia myuros var. megalura, commonly known as the giant bristlegrass, is a variant of the species Vulpia myuros, which is a member of the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, robust growth habit and long, slender leaves. The plant typically forms dense clumps and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the typical form, making it easily distinguishable in the field."
