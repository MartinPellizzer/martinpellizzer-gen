    "intro": "Vilfa spartinae, commonly known as coastal cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often forming dense mats that stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies. Vilfa spartinae plays a crucial role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife species."
