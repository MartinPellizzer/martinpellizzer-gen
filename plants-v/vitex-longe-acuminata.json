    "intro": "Vitex longe-acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds. Vitex longe-acuminata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
