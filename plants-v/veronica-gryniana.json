    "intro": "Veronica gryniana, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has oval, pointed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
