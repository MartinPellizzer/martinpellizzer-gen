It features opposite, ovate leaves with prominent reddish veins, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by ornamental red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil."
