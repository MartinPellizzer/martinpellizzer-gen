    "intro": "Viburnum parviflorum, commonly known as smooth hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by showy, spherical fruits that turn from white to red as they mature. Viburnum parviflorum thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and fruit, which provide seasonal interest throughout the growing season."
