    "intro": "Verbena lambertii, commonly known as the Lambert's verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant purple or blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its slender stems and small, opposite leaves are adapted to conserve water, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Verbena lambertii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
