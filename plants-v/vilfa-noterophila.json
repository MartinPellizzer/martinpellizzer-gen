    "intro": "Vilfa noterophila, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vilfa, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and yellow, contributing to its ornamental value in native gardens."
