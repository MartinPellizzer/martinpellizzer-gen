    "intro": "Vaccinium mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, which are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
