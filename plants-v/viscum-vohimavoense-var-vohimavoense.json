    "intro": "Viscum vohimavoense var. vohimavoense, commonly known as the Vohimavo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing food for certain bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
