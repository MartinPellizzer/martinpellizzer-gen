    "intro": "Verbascum ballsianum, commonly known as the Armenian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Verbascum ballsianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
