    "intro": "Virectaria major subsp. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping virectaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in arid climates."
