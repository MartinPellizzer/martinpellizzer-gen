    "intro": "Viscum articulatum var. dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found growing on oak and other broad-leaved trees. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. Its small, white or pale green berries are often used in traditional medicine. The species plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
