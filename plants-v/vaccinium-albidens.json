    "intro": "Vaccinium albidens, commonly known as the white highbush blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its fruits are small, white, and somewhat fleshy, ripening in the fall and often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure."
