    "intro": "Viola orphanidis f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved viola, is a botanical variant of the viola genus native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and vibrant violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in association with other woodland flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
