    "intro": "Verbascum suworowianum var. papillosum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered in dense, fuzzy gray-white hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, also covered in soft, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a clustered inflorescence at the top of the stem. This plant is often used in traditional medicine and is also a popular ornamental species due to its striking appearance."
