    "intro": "Vigna chiovendae, commonly known as the Cusco bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, typical of many species in the Vigna genus. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain one to three seeds, which are often used in traditional Andean cuisine. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions, making it a resilient crop. Vigna chiovendae is also valued for its nutritional content, including high levels of protein and essential minerals."
