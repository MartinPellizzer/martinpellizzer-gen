    "intro": "Veronica beccabunga var. bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and damp meadows. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
