    "intro": "Verbascum stellatum, commonly known as starleaf mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties have also been historically valued for their soothing effects on respiratory conditions."
