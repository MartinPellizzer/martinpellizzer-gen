    "intro": "Viburnum tomentosum, commonly known as snowball bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring, giving it its common name. The plant has ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, contributing to its textured appearance. It produces red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Viburnum tomentosum thrives in partial to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
