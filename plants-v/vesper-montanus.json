    "intro": "Vesper montanus, commonly known as the evening mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, hence its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a silver-green hue and a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Vesper montanus is adapted to cool, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique flowering pattern makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
