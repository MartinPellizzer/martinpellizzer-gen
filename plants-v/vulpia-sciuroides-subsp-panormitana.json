It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate saline environments. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
