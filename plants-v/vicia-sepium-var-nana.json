    "intro": "Vicia sepium var. nana, commonly known as dwarf common vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in waste places. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
