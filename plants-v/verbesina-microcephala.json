It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
