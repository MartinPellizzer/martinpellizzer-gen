It is a shrub or small tree native to regions of southern Africa, characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species often used in ecological restoration projects."
