    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant grass vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and adaptable species. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
