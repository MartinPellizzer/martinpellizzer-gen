It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread via stolons, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
