    "intro": "Valeriana kansuensis, commonly known as Kansu valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months. Its rhizomes and roots are the primary parts used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana kansuensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats at higher altitudes."
