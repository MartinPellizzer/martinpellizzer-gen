    "intro": "Vincetoxicum flexuosum var. tenuis, commonly known as slender yellow ivy, is a climbing plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in natural areas."
