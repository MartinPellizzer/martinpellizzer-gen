    "intro": "Vitis robinsonii, commonly known as Robinson's grape, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody vine that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
