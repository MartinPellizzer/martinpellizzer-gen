    "intro": "Volvulus japonicus var. pubescens, commonly known as the Japanese velvet vine, is a climbing plant characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to East Asia, particularly Japan. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in summer. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or walls, though it can become invasive if not controlled. The varietal name 'pubescens' refers to the soft, hairy texture of its foliage."
