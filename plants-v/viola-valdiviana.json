    "intro": "Viola valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Viola valdiviana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
