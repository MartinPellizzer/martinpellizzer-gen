    "intro": "Vitis vulpina, commonly known as the fox grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It produces small, sour-tasting berries that are typically consumed by wildlife, particularly foxes, hence its common name. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and can grow up to 20 meters in length, often climbing trees or shrubs. Its flowers are greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that ripen in the fall. Vitis vulpina is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
