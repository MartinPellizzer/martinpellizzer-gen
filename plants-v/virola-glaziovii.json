    "intro": "Virola glaziovii, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces fragrant, yellow flowers that are often clustered in panicles, followed by large, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Virola glaziovii is valued for its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
