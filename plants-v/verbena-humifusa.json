    "intro": "Verbena humifusa, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bright blue or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Verbena humifusa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
