    "intro": "Verbascum warionis, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, grayish-white hairs. The leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a terminal spike. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
