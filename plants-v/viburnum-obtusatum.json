    "intro": "Viburnum obtusatum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
