It is characterized by its tall, erect stem covered in dense, soft grayish-white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of fuzzy hairs. Verbascum pterocalycinum is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
