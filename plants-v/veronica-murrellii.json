    "intro": "Veronica murrellii, commonly known as Murrell's speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Veronica murrellii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
