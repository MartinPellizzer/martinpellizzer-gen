It features heart-shaped leaves with short, glandular hairs and distinctive violet flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a compact growth habit. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The variety is characterized by its shorter stipules compared to other viola species, giving it its specific name."
