It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture, and it produces small, bract-like leaves beneath the flower heads.
