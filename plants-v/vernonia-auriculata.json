It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 2 feet tall, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its scientific name refers to the ear-like shape of its leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. Vernonia auriculata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
