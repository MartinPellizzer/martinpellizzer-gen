    "intro": "Valeriana globifera, commonly known as the globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are arranged in globular inflorescences, giving it its common name. Valeriana globifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported sedative properties."
