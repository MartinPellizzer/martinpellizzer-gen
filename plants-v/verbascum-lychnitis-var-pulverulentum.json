    "intro": "Verbascum lychnitis var. pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense spikes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a fine layer of soft hairs, contributing to its common name. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands."
