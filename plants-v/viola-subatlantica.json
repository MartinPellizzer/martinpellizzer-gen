    "intro": "Viola subatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions. Viola subatlantica is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
