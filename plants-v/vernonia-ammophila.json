    "intro": "Vernonia ammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United States and Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia ammophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
