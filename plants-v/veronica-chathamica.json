    "intro": "Veronica chathamica, commonly known as Chatham Island speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in open habitats with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
