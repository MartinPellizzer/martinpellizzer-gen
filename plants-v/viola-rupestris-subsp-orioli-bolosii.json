    "intro": "Viola rupestris subsp. orioli-bolosii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre violet, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet or purple, with five petals arranged in a typical violet-like pattern. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
