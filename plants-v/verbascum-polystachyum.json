    "intro": "Verbascum polystachyum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a similar fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Verbascum polystachyum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
