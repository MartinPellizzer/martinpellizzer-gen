It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
