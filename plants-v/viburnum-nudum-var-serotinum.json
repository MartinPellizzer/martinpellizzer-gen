    "intro": "Viburnum nudum var. serotinum, commonly known as the late-leafed arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that turn red or orange in the fall before dropping, distinguishing it from other viburnum species. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its berries are dark blue to black and serve as a food source for birds. Viburnum nudum var. serotinum is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
