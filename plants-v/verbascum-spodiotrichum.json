It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their soothing properties."
