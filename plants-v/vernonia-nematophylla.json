It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical heads. Vernonia nematophylla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
