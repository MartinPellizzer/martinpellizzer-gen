    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia proles thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
