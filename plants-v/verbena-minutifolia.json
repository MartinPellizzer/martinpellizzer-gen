    "intro": "Verbena minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf verbena, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of only a few inches. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Verbena minutifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
