    "intro": "Vandellia harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's vandellia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
