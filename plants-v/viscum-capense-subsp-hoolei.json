    "intro": "Viscum capense subsp. hoolei, commonly known as the coastal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It primarily grows on the branches of acacia trees and other host species, relying on them for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and typically arranged in pairs along the stems. This subspecies is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in areas with high humidity and salt spray."
