    "intro": "Vulpia geniculata var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed or wetland habitats. The variety *attenuata* is distinguished by its elongated, gradually tapering leaves compared to the more robust leaves of the typical *Vulpia geniculata*."
