    "intro": "Vernonia rubricaulis var. pseudoincana, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant features rough, hairy stems that are typically reddish in color, which contribute to its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a rough texture. This species is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
