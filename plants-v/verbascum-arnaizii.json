    "intro": "Verbascum arnaizii, commonly known as the Arnaiz mullein, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, sunny habitats and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
