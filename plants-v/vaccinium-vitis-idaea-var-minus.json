    "intro": "Vaccinium vitis-idaea var. minus, commonly known as lesser bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to boreal and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is smaller than the typical V. vitis-idaea and is adapted to harsh, cold climates."
