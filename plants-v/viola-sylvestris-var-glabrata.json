    "intro": "Viola sylvestris var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The smooth, hairless leaves and compact growth habit distinguish this variety from other viola species."
