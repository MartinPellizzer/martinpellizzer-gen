    "intro": "Veronica buxbaumii, commonly known as the desert sand veronica, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with dense, hair-like covering, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Veronica buxbaumii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
