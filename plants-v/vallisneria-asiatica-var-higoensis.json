    "intro": "Vallisneria asiatica var. higoensis, commonly known as the Higoensis waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, often forming dense underwater vegetation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in the water column rather than on the surface. It thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to strong water flow and requires good water quality. This variety is often used in aquaculture and aquatic gardens for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits."
