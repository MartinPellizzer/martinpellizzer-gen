    "intro": "Vaccinium leiandrum, commonly known as the creeping blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the spring. Its dark blue, edible berries are typically harvested in late summer and are prized for their tart flavor. Vaccinium leiandrum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
