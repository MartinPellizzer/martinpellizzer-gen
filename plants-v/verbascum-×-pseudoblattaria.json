    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 pseudoblattaria, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum phlomoides. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides and dry meadows. It produces tall, hairy stems with large, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers. Its botanical features make it an attractive but somewhat invasive species in certain regions."
