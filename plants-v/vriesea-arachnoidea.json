    "intro": "Vriesea arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a spider's legs, giving it its common name. The plant features broad, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central tank to collect rainwater. Its flowers are typically orange or red with yellow markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Vriesea arachnoidea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
