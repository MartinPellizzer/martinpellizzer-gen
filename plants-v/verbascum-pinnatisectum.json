    "intro": "Verbascum pinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, velvety, gray-green leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
