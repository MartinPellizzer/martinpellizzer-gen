    "intro": "Vanda hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan vanda, is a tropical orchid native to China's Hainan Island. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Vanda hainanensis thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
