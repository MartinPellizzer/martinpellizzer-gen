    "intro": "Vaseyanthus insularis var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's island hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with red stamens, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in coastal and rocky habitats. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
