    "intro": "Vladimiria edulis, commonly known as the edible vladimiria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and have a tangy, citrus-like flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
