    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 arctotrichum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Verbascum and Arctotrichum. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. The plant produces tall, hairy stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, velvety, and gray-green, resembling those of the common mullein. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
