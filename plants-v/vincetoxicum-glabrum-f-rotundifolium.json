    "intro": "Vincetoxicum glabrum f. rotundifolium, commonly known as the rounded-leaf false bindweed, is a variant of the species Vincetoxicum glabrum, characterized by its broad, rounded leaves. It is a deciduous perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, shady environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, rounded leaves. However, it can be invasive in some regions and requires careful management."
