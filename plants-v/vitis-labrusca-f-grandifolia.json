    "intro": "Vitis labrusca f. grandifolia, commonly known as the fox grape, is a cultivar of the fox grape species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically used for winemaking due to their high tannin content. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the vines are vigorous climbers with thornless stems. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its agricultural significance in viticulture."
