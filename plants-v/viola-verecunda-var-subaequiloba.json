    "intro": "Viola verecunda var. subaequiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with yellow centers. The plant prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated, narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Viola verecunda."
