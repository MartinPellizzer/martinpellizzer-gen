It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
