    "intro": "Vaccaria oxyodonta, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, blue or purple flowers and fleshy, lobed leaves that help it retain water in salty, arid environments. The plant belongs to the family Cistaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Vaccaria oxyodonta is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
