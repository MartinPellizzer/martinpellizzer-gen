    "intro": "Viscum palleolatum var. perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while performing photosynthesis to some extent. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found on oak and elm trees. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
