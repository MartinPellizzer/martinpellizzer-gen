    "intro": "Viburnum crassifolium, commonly known as prickly hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it often grows in moist woodlands or along stream banks. Viburnum crassifolium is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
