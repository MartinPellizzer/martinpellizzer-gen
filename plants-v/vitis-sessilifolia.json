    "intro": "Vitis sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobes, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when mature, though they may turn red or black depending on the variety. Vitis sessilifolia is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It is also used in some horticultural practices for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade."
