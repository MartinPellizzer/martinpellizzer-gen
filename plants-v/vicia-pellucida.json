    "intro": "Vicia pellucida, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia pellucida is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
