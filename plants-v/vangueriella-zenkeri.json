    "intro": "Vangueriella zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's vangueriella, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
