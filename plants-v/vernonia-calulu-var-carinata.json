    "intro": "Vernonia calulu var. carinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
