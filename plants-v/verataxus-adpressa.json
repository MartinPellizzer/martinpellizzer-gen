    "intro": "Verataxus adpressa, commonly known as the flatleaf verataxus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features a mat-forming growth habit with closely spaced, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are typically greenish-white in color. Its foliage is characterized by a unique waxy texture and a distinct, aromatic scent when crushed. Verataxus adpressa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
