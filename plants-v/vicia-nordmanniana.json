    "intro": "Vicia nordmanniana, commonly known as Nordmann's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system forms nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. Vicia nordmanniana is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils."
