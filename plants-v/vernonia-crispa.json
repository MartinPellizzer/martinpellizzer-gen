    "intro": "Vernonia crispa, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia crispa is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
