    "intro": "Vincetoxicum stephanotrichum, commonly known as the hairy false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are small, clustered, and typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
