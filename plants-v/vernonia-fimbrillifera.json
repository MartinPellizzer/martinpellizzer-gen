    "intro": "Vernonia fimbrillifera, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are valued for their strength and have been used traditionally in basket-making. Vernonia fimbrillifera is also known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
