    "intro": "Vicia monantha var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothpod vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by inflated, smooth pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can play a role in soil enrichment in certain environments."
