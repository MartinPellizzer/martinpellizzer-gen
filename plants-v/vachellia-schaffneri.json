    "intro": "Vachellia schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical heads, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a capacity for drought tolerance. Vachellia schaffneri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
