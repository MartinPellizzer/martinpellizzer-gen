    "intro": "Vaccinium capillatum, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America. It features small, oval leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that range in color from red to black. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. Vaccinium capillatum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas."
