    "intro": "Vernonia zambesiaca, commonly known as the Zambesi ironweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
