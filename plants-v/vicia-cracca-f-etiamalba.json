    "intro": "Vicia cracca f. etiamalba, commonly known as the white vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its white flowers instead of the typical yellow. It is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces slender, branching pods that contain small, rounded seeds. It is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Its botanical features make it both ecologically valuable and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
