    "intro": "Verbascum bicolle, commonly known as the two-colored mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem covered in soft, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It produces showy yellowish-green flowers in clusters at the top of the plant, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
