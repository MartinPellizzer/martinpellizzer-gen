    "intro": "Verbesina myriocephala, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble a crown, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant has alternate, hairy, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often glandular and aromatic. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, commonly found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
