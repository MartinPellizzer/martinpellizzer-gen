    "intro": "Vicia esdraelonensis, commonly known as the Esdraelon vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Vicia esdraelonensis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
