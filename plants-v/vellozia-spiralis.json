    "intro": "Vellozia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral vellozia, is a unique plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Velloziaceae and is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Its flowers are small and typically greenish-white, clustered in dense inflorescences. Vellozia spiralis is often found in rocky outcrops and is a striking example of xerophytic adaptation."
