    "intro": "Vahadenia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in summer. Vahadenia has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it retain water in dry environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and beauty."
