    "intro": "Vernonia scabrida, commonly known as rough vernonia, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the common name, and the plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Vernonia scabrida is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
