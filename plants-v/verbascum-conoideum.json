    "intro": "Verbascum conoideum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, woolly leaves that are covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum conoideum is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects."
