    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. ambigua, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, and it is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to poor conditions make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
