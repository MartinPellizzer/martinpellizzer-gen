    "intro": "Vriesea repandostachys, commonly known as the rainbow plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a rainbow, with bracts in shades of red, orange, yellow, and green. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage that holds water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea repandostachys is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
