    "intro": "Valeriana dioica var. sylvatica, commonly known as wood valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, blooming in late summer. The roots are rich in essential oils and have been used traditionally for their sedative and calming properties."
