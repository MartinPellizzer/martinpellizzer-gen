    "intro": "Vernonia aborigina, commonly known as the Aboriginal ironwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rough, dark bark and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor, sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in dryland landscaping and has cultural significance to Indigenous Australian communities."
