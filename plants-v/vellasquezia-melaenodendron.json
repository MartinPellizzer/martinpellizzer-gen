    "intro": "Vellasquezia melaenodendron, commonly known as the black-leaved tree, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and other related species. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
