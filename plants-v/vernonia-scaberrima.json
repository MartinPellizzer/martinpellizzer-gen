It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as savannas and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are usually rough to the touch, with a distinctive silvery or grayish underside, and the flowers are yellow with a prominent central disc. Vernonia scaberrima is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
