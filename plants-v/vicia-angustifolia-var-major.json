    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and soil enrichment projects."
