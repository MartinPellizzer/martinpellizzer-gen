    "intro": "Vicia villosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods containing several kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including those that are poorly drained. Vicia villosa subsp. villosa is also known for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
