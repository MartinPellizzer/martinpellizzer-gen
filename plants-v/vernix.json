    "intro": "Vernix, commonly known as the waxy coating on newborn skin, is a natural substance composed primarily of lipids, proteins, and water. It serves as a protective barrier, preventing moisture loss and offering antibacterial properties. This coating is produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin and is present in full term infants. The vernix also plays a role in the infant's transition to life outside the womb by facilitating the first breath and reducing the risk of infections. Its presence is a sign of healthy fetal development and is often gently rinsed off during the first bath."
