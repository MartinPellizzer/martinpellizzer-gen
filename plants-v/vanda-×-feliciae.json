The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its flowers are typically showy, with a range of colors including blue, purple, and white, and they often have a strong, sweet fragrance. Vanda \u00d7 feliciae requires good air circulation and indirect sunlight to flourish, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
