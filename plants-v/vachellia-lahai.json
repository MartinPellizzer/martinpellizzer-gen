    "intro": "Vachellia lahai, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. Vachellia lahai is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood."
