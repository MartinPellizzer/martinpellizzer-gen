    "intro": "Vicia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in woodland and forested areas, often found in association with pine trees. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets. Vicia pinetorum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
