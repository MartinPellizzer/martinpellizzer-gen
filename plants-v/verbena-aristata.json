    "intro": "Verbena aristata, commonly known as mountain verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Verbena aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in drought conditions."
