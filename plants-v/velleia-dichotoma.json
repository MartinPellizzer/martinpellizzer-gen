    "intro": "Velleia dichotoma, commonly known as the clustered velleia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Velleia dichotoma is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
