    "intro": "Vicia multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, creeping stems that can branch profusely, giving it its common name. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically pink or purple, and it produces slender, twisted pods containing several seeds. Vicia multicaulis is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
