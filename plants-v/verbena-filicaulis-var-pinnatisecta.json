    "intro": "Verbena filicaulis var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the feathery verbena, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage with finely divided, pinnatisected leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and extended blooming period make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and pollinator-friendly landscapes."
