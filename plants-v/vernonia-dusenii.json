    "intro": "Vernonia dusenii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia dusenii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
