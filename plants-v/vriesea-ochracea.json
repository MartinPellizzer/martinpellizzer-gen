    "intro": "Vriesea ochracea, commonly known as the golden vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that typically displays shades of yellow and orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Vriesea ochracea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
