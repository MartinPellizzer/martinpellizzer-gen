    "intro": "Varronia mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Varronia mollissima is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
