    "intro": "Veronica herniarioides, commonly known as common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Veronica herniarioides is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas."
