It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Vimen prostrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
