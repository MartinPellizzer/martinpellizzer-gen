    "intro": "Viola copahuensis, commonly known as the Copahue violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andes mountains of Chile. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude, moist environments, often in forest understories or rocky soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola copahuensis is considered a vulnerable species."
