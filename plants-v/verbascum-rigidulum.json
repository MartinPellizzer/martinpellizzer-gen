    "intro": "Verbascum rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with dense, woolly gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Verbascum rigidulum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
