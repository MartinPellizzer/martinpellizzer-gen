    "intro": "Vachellia farnesiana f. microcarpa, commonly known as the little-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow floral spikes that appear during the dry season. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments with minimal water requirements. This variety is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock."
