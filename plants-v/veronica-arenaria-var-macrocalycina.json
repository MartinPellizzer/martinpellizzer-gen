    "intro": "Veronica arenaria var. macrocalycina, commonly known as the sand veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to thrive in arid or coastal environments. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it is often found in dunes, gravelly slopes, and other well-drained habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
