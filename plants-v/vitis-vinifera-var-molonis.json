It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and is typically used for making dessert wines. The plant has a moderate growth habit and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are medium-sized, lobed, and have a glossy appearance. Due to its limited cultivation, it is not widely recognized in the global wine industry."
