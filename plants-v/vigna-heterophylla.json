    "intro": "Vigna heterophylla, commonly known as the variable cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from trifoliate to pinnate, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, usually yellow or white flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein. Vigna heterophylla is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting subsequent crop growth."
