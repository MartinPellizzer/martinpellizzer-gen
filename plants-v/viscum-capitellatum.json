    "intro": "Viscum capitellatum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of coniferous trees, such as pines and firs, and derives its nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are scale-like and its flowers are inconspicuous, often green or yellow-green in color. Viscum capitellatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for certain bird species."
