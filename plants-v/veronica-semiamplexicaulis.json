    "intro": "Veronica semiamplexicaulis, commonly known as the clustered speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly succulent texture, adapting to its alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and prolonged blooming period."
