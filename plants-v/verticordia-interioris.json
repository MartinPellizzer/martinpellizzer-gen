    "intro": "Verticordia interioris, commonly known as the interior leafless banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Verticordia interioris is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
