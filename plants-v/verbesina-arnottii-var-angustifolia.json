    "intro": "Verbesina arnottii var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name, and it is often found in moist, open habitats like meadows and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other varieties of Verbesina arnottii."
