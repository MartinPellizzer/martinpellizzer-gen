    "intro": "Vangueria cinerascens var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth vangueria, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to semi-arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
