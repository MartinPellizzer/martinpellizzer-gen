    "intro": "Vesicaria newberryi, commonly known as Newberry's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it can float or anchor itself to submerged vegetation. Its leaves are often divided into narrow segments, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a predator and a habitat for microorganisms."
