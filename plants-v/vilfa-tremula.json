    "intro": "Vilfa tremula, commonly known as the trembling willow, is a deciduous tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and finely divided, feathery leaves that flutter in the wind. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Its rapid growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
