    "intro": "Viola dissecta var. eizanensis, commonly known as the Eizan violet, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, velvety hair. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of violet and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
