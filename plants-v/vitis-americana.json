    "intro": "Vitis americana, commonly known as the American grapevine, is a deciduous woody vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that range in color from green to black, depending on the variety. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Vitis americana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit for both humans and wildlife."
