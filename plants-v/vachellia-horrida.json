    "intro": "Vachellia horrida, commonly known as the burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh climates. Vachellia horrida is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
