    "intro": "Verbena incarnata, commonly known as swamp verbena, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, clustered purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Verbena incarnata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soil conditions."
