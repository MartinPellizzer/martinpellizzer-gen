    "intro": "Verdesmum hentyi, commonly known as the Henty's velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
