    "intro": "Viviania crenata var. petiolata, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in wetland environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, often forming dense mats on the surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring it to the substrate and facilitating vegetative propagation. The leaves are usually green, with a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
