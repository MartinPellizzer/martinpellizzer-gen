    "intro": "Viola imberbis, commonly known as the hairless violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the species name \"imberbis\" refers to the lack of prominent hairs on its stems. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet or purple, usually with five petals and a distinctive spur. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Viola imberbis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
