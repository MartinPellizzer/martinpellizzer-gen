It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and trifoliate leaves with hairy undersides. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-bearing segments. Its fruit is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to various climatic conditions."
