    "intro": "Vitis \u00d7 instabilis, commonly known as the unstable grape, is a hybrid species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and variable morphology, which has led to its name. The plant typically produces tendrils, heart-shaped leaves, and small, clustered flowers. Its berries are usually small and can vary in color from green to black. Due to its genetic instability, it is often used in breeding programs to develop new grape varieties."
