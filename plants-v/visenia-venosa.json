    "intro": "Visenia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
