    "intro": "Vicia vestita var. raripila, commonly known as the rare hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, and its trifoliate leaves are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. This variety is distinguished by its rarity and unique morphological features compared to other vetch species."
