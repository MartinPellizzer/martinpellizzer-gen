    "intro": "Veronica anagalloides var. oxytheca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
