    "intro": "Villadia texana, commonly known as the Texas villadia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
