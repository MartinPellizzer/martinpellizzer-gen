    "intro": "Vicia unijuga var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate vetch, is a rare variant of the vetch genus native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are pinnately divided with small stipules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
