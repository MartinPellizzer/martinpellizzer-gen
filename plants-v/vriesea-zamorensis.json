    "intro": "Vriesea zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamorensis Vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange, often with a contrasting green or blue center. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect water. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea zamorensis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
