    "intro": "Viburnum lucidum, commonly known as shining viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full sun. Viburnum lucidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract wildlife."
