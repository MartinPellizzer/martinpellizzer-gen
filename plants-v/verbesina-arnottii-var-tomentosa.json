    "intro": "Verbesina arnottii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly beggar-tick, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
