    "intro": "Vicia sicula, commonly known as Sicilian vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vicia sicula is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments."
