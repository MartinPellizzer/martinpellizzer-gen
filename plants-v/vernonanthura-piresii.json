    "intro": "Vernonanthura piresii, commonly known as the Pires' spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, thin petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are often pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
