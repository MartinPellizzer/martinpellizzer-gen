    "intro": "Viola pruinosa, commonly known as the powdered violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of North America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from violet to white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Viola pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
