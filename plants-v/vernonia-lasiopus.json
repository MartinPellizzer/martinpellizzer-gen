    "intro": "Vernonia lasiopus, commonly known as ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The showy purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
