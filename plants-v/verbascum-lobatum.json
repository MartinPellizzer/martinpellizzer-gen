    "intro": "Verbascum lobatum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical spike. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs. Verbascum lobatum is often found in rocky or dry soils and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
