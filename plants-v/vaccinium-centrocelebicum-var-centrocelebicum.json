    "intro": "Vaccinium centrocelebicum var. centrocelebicum, commonly known as the Central Island blueberry, is a species native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in coastal areas and along stream banks. The plant produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. It has small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary history and adaptation to its isolated habitat."
