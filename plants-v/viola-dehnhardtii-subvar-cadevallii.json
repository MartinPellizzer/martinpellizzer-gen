    "intro": "Viola dehnhardtii subvar. cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
