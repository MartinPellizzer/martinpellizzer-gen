    "intro": "Vicia parvula, commonly known as the small vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Vicia parvula is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
