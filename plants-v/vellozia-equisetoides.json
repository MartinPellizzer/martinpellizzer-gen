It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and high temperatures. Its morphology reflects evolutionary strategies for survival in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
