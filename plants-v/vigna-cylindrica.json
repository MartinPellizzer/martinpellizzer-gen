    "intro": "Vigna cylindrica, commonly known as the cowpea, is an annual legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, hairy pods that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with trifoliate leaves and small white or pink flowers. Its root system fixes nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable crop for soil enrichment. Vigna cylindrica thrives in warm climates and is widely cultivated for both human consumption and animal feed."
