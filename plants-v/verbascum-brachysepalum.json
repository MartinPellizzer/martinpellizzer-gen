    "intro": "Verbascum brachysepalum, commonly known as the short-sepal mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum brachysepalum is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
