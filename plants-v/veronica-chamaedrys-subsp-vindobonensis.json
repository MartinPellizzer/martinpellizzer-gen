    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys subsp. vindobonensis, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes."
