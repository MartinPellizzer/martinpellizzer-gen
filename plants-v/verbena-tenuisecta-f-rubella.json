It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, and its distinctive red-tinged foliage. The plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. It is drought-tolerant and produces copious amounts of nectar, attracting bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant leaf color and long blooming season."
