It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Viola congener thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to the landscape during the cooler months."
