    "intro": "Veronica muscosa, commonly known as the mossy speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-like foliage that often resembles moss. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Veronica muscosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
