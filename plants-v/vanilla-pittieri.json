    "intro": "Vanilla pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or wild vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It produces fragrant, dark brown vanilla pods that are similar in appearance to the more commercially cultivated vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires a support structure to grow. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, intricate structure. The vanilla pods are harvested when mature and can be used in culinary applications, though they are less commonly used than traditional vanilla beans."
