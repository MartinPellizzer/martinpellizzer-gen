    "intro": "Viburnum acerifolium f. collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' maple-leaf viburnum, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, maple-like leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its seasonal color changes and adaptability to various garden conditions."
