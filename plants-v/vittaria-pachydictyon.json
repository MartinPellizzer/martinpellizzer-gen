    "intro": "Vittaria pachydictyon, commonly known as the broad-leafed hoya, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Vittaria pachydictyon thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
