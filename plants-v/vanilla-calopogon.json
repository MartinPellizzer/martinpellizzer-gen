    "intro": "Vanilla calopogon, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive pink or purple pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, with intricate patterns on its petals. The plant grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the species is considered rare due to habitat loss. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystems."
