    "intro": "Vriesea joyae var. parvula, commonly known as the miniature vriesea, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its roots. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
