    "intro": "Veronica subalpina, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, often with a white or pinkish throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Veronica subalpina is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
