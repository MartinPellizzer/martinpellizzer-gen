It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, often found in association with coniferous trees. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces violet-blue flowers with yellow markings. Its subspecies is distinguished by its grayish-green foliage and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other viola species.
