    "intro": "Viticella orientalis, commonly known as the Persian grape or Persian ivy, is a climbing plant native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and produces small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and can be trained to climb walls or trellises. The berries, which are small and black when mature, are edible but not typically cultivated for commercial use."
