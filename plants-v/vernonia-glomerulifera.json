    "intro": "Vernonia glomerulifera, commonly known as the clustered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white to grayish seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Vernonia glomerulifera is often found in open woods, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
