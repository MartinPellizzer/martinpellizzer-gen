It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in certain ecosystems."
