    "intro": "Viscum myriophlebium var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Western Cape, where it thrives in coastal fynbos vegetation. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of its stems, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. Its berries, which are typically red, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
