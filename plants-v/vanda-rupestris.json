    "intro": "Vanda rupestris, commonly known as the rock vanda, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in summer. Vanda rupestris thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes due to its ornamental value and ecological significance."
