    "intro": "Viola suberosa, commonly known as the woolly violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces showy violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Viola suberosa is a member of the Violaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native plant communities."
