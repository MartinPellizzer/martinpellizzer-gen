    "intro": "Vriesea nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange and yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, waxy, and have a velvety texture, which helps in moisture retention. Vriesea nervosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
