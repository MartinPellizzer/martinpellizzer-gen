    "intro": "Viguiera phenax, commonly known as Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces showy yellow-orange ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera phenax thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its resilience in arid environments."
