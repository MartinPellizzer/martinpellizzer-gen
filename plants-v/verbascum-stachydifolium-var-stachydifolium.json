It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are covered in soft, white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage make it well adapted to arid environments."
