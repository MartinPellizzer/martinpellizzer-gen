    "intro": "Verbascum phlomoides var. denudatum, commonly known as the naked leaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, fuzzy hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped and gradually become smaller and more sparse toward the top of the plant. It produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments."
