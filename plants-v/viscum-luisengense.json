    "intro": "Viscum luisengense, commonly known as the Luisengense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaceae. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through a specialized structure called a haustellum. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host but also performs photosynthesis using its leaf-like structures. It produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum luisengense is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is noted for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
