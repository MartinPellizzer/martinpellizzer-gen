    "intro": "Verbena cameronensis, commonly known as Cameron's verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cameron's verbena is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
