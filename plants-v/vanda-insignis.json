    "intro": "Vanda insignis, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Vanda insignis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its dramatic floral displays."
