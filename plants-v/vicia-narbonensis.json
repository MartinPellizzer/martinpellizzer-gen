    "intro": "Vicia narbonensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Vicia narbonensis is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
