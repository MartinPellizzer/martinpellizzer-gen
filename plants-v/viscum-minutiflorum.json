    "intro": "Viscum minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It grows on the branches of various coniferous trees, such as pines and firs, and derives its nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and it relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Viscum minutiflorum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting a variety of wildlife."
