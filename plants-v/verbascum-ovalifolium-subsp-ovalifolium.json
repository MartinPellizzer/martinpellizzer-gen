    "intro": "Verbascum ovalifolium subsp. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. This species is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
