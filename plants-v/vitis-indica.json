It is characterized by its tendrils, heart-shaped leaves, and small, sour-tasting berries. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along riverbanks and in moist, shaded areas. Its berries are used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye. The botanical features of Vitis indica make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
