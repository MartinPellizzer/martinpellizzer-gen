    "intro": "Vittaria coccygocarpa, commonly known as the spore-bearing fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
