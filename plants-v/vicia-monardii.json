    "intro": "Vicia monardii, commonly known as the Mexican vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods are slender, elongated, and contain several seeds. Vicia monardii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
