    "intro": "Viscum australe, commonly known as the Australian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other native Australian trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a waxy surface. Viscum australe plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
