    "intro": "Valeriana praecipitis, commonly known as the cliff valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often on cliffs or slopes, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, aromatic scent, which is characteristic of the Valeriana genus. Valeriana praecipitis is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used for its calming effects."
