    "intro": "Vaccinium prostratum, commonly known as creeping blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, tart blue berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
