    "intro": "Verbesina laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf beggar-ticks, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fern-like, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Verbesina laciniata is also known for its prickly, hairy stems and seeds that adhere to clothing and fur, aiding in its dispersal."
