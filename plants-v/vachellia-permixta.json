    "intro": "Vachellia permixta, commonly known as the mixed acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often reduced to small leaflets, and its yellow or pale yellow flowers that appear in dense, globular clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Vachellia permixta is often used for soil stabilization and has cultural significance in some regions."
