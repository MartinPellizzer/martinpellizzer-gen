    "intro": "Vicia communis var. linearis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, waste areas, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
