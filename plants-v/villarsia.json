These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. Villarsia species typically produce small, fragrant blooms in shades of purple, blue, and white. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their compact size and ability to thrive in indoor environments. The genus includes several species, such as Villarsia glabra and Villarsia natalensis, which are valued for their aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
