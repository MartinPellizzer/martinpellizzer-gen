    "intro": "Vernonia baldwinii f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. This variety is distinguished by its notably white flowers, which set it apart from other forms of Vernonia baldwinii."
