    "intro": "Vanda sulingi, commonly known as the Sulu vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. Vanda sulingi thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
