    "intro": "Vincentella kemoensis, commonly known as the Kemo vine, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
