    "intro": "Vaccinium serpens, commonly known as the serpentine blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, dark blue or black berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, providing a dense cover that helps retain moisture. Vaccinium serpens plays an important ecological role by supporting local wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
