    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys var. procerior, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas."
