It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy white flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and drought tolerance."
