    "intro": "Veratrum mandschuricum, commonly known as the Siberian aconite, is a tall perennial herb native to the forests of eastern Asia. It features a stout, upright stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, slender peduncles. Its roots and rhizomes contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both medicinal and cautionary interest. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Russia."
