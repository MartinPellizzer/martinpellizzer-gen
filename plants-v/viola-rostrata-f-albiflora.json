    "intro": "Viola rostrata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered violets, is a rare and striking variant of the common violet. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its dark green, heart-shaped leaves. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in shaded, moist woodlands. The foliage is typically covered in a fine, soft down, giving it a velvety texture. It blooms in early spring and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
