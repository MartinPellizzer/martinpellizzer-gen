    "intro": "Vernonia scaposa, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia scaposa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to wetland environments."
