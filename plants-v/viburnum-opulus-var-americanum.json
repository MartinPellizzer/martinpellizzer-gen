    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. americanum, commonly known as American dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features showy, white, flat-topped flower clusters that appear in spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full shade. The bark is smooth and often has a distinctive flaky appearance, especially on older stems."
