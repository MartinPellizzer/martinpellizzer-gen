    "intro": "Vochysia oblongifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or yellow bell, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Vochysia oblongifolia is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments."
