    "intro": "Vanilla madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by a specific species of bee found only in its native habitat. The plant's most valuable feature is its pod, which develops from the flower and contains the aromatic vanilla extract used in food and fragrance industries. The pods require a lengthy maturation period and are harvested when they are fully mature and dried. Due to its unique pollination requirements, Vanilla madagascariensis is considered a rare and economically significant crop."
