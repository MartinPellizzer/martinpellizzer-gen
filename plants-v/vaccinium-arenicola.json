    "intro": "Vaccinium arenicola, commonly known as the sand heath or coastal blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or black in color. It has narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Vaccinium arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
