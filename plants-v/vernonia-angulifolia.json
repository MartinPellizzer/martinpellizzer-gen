It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flower heads that are often mistaken for leaves due to their shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Vernonia angulifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some regions."
