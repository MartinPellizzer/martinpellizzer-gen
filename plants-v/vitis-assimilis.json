    "intro": "Vitis assimilis, commonly known as the Chinese sand grape, is a species of flowering vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of small, round berries. These berries are edible but are not commonly consumed due to their tart flavor and high acidity. Vitis assimilis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
