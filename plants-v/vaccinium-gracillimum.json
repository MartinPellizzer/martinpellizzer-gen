    "intro": "Vaccinium gracillimum, commonly known as the slender blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in late summer. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them popular among wildlife and humans alike. Vaccinium gracillimum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
