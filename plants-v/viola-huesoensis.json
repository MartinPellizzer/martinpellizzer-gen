It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola huesoensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
