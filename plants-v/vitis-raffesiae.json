    "intro": "Vitis raffesiae, commonly known as the Raffles vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family, which includes grapes and other climbing vines. The plant is characterized by its tendrils and compound leaves, which help it climb and spread across forest canopies. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters. Vitis raffesiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit."
