    "intro": "Virola parkeri, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of large, round fruits containing sticky, yellowish pulp. Virola parkeri is also notable for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine for their purported healing effects. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
