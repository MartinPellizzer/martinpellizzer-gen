    "intro": "Vitis sicyoides var. tamoides, commonly known as the Tamol Island grape, is a rare and lesser-known vine native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of berries, which are typically green when mature. Its botanical features include heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that aid in its climbing growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
