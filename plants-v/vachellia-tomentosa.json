    "intro": "Vachellia tomentosa, commonly known as the silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its greyish-white, fuzzy foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its bark is often fissured and may exude a milky sap when damaged. Vachellia tomentosa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood."
