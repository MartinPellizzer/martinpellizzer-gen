    "intro": "Vaccinium phillippsiae, commonly known as the Phillipps' blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a dark green color with a slight waxy coating. Vaccinium phillippsiae thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils."
