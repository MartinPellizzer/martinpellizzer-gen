    "intro": "Vicia graminea var. bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or white. The plant has bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and distinctive two-toothed tips on the leaflets, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
