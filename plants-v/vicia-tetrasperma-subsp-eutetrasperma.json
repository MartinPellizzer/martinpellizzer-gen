    "intro": "Vicia tetrasperma subsp. eutetrasperma, commonly known as the four-seeded vetch, is a leguminous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by pods that contain four elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
