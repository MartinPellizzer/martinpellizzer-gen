    "intro": "Viviania rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered viviania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its striking red petals that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Viviania rubriflora is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
