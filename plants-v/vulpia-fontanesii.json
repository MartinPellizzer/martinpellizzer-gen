    "intro": "Vulpia fontanesii, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Vulpia fontanesii is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
