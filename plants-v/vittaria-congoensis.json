    "intro": "Vittaria congoensis, commonly known as the Congo fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Vittaria congoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
