    "intro": "Virgularia, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the dandelion family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their spiny, lobed leaves and showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The genus includes several species, such as *Virgularia rivularis*, which is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness. Virgularia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
