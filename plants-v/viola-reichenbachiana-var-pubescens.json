    "intro": "Viola reichenbachiana var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, foliage, which gives it its specific variety name. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive downward-facing structure, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is often cultivated for its beauty and is adapted to well-drained, moist soils in partial shade."
