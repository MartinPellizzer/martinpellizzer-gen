    "intro": "Valerianoides longespicata, commonly known as the long-spurred valerian, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caprifoliaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant produces tiny, elongated fruits known as schizocarps, which disperse its seeds through wind. Valerianoides longespicata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
