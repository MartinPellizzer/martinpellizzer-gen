    "intro": "Vallesia cymbifolia, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that ranges in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the wet season. Vallesia cymbifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
