    "intro": "Vicia cracca f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf yellow vetch, is a variant of the common vetch. It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is a legume, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in soil stabilization."
