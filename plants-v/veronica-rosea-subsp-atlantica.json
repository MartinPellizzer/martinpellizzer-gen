    "intro": "Veronica rosea subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments, where it tolerates salt spray and coastal conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
