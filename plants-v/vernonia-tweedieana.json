    "intro": "Vernonia tweedieana, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous, and woody structure, which makes it highly resistant to damage from wind and fire. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in coastal and upland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
