    "intro": "Vincetoxicum sylvaticum, commonly known as the wild white bittersweet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bright red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it a cautionary species in horticulture. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Vincetoxicum sylvaticum is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
