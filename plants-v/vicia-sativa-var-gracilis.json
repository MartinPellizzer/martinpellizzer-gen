    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. gracilis, commonly known as slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in fields. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
