    "intro": "Vallisneria higoensis, commonly known as the Higoensis waterweed, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with the lower portion submerged. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Vallisneria higoensis reproduces through the production of small, yellowish-brown fruits that contain numerous seeds. It plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
