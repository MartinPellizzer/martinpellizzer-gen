    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pinkish flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Valeriana officinalis var. incisa is often used in traditional medicine for its sedative properties, similar to other valerian species."
