It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The showy purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
