    "intro": "Verbascum spathulisepalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a clustered inflorescence. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive, fuzzy texture, while its flowers are characterized by their elongated, tubular shape. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
