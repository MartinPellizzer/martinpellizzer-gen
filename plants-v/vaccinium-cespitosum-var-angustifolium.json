    "intro": "Vaccinium cespitosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow, and leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which give way to the edible, bright blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and for its use in local ecosystems and as a food source for wildlife."
