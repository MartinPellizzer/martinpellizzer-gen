    "intro": "Vangueria cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf vangueria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pale green upper surface and a greyish underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. Vangueria cinerascens is known for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
