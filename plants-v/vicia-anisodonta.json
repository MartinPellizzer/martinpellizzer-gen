    "intro": "Vicia anisodonta, commonly known as the broadleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Vicia anisodonta is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobial bacteria."
