It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy as well. Vernonia heterocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
