    "intro": "Vincetoxicum purpureum, commonly known as purple milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores and a potential hazard to livestock."
