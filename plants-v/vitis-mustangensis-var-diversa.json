    "intro": "Vitis mustangensis var. diversa, commonly known as the Mustang grape, is a rare and native species found primarily in the southwestern United States. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered berries that range in color from green to black. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons. Its botanical features include tendrils for climbing and a woody vine structure typical of many Vitaceae species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
