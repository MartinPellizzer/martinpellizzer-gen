    "intro": "Villouratea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, often growing in moist, disturbed habitats. Villouratea is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
