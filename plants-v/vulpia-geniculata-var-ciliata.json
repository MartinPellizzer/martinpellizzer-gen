    "intro": "Vulpia geniculata var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
