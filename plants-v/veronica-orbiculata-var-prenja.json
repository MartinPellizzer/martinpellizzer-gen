It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine gardens. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
