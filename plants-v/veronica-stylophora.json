It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Veronica stylophora is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
