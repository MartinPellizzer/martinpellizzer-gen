    "intro": "Vriesea fontellana, commonly known as the flame torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features vibrant, red-orange bracts that surround its central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant's foliage is evergreen, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for indoor cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea fontellana is prized for its ornamental value and ability to bloom repeatedly under proper care."
