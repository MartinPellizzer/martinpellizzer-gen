    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia f. hortensis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a cultivated form of the common vetch. It is a leguminous plant characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, slender pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often grown as a cover crop or for forage due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in sustainable gardening practices."
