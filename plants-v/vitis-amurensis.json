    "intro": "Vitis amurensis, commonly known as Amur grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Russia, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its robust vines, which can grow up to 10 meters in length, and its large, heart-shaped leaves. Its small, yellow-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. Vitis amurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability to various climates."
