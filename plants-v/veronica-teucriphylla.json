    "intro": "Veronica teucriphylla, commonly known as the silverleaf veronica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue underside. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period."
