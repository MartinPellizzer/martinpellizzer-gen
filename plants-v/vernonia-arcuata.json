    "intro": "Vernonia arcuata, commonly known as the golden ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vernonia arcuata is often found in moist, open habitats like meadows and woodland edges."
