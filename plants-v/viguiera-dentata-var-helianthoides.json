It features showy, daisy-like yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves with a slightly rough texture, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.
