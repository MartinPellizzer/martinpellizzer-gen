    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
