    "intro": "Veratrum ussuriense, commonly known as Ussuri White Hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Far East of Russia and parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Veratrum ussuriense contains toxic alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine, though it requires careful handling due to its potent nature."
