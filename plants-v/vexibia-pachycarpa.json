It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with unique morphological features. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy fruits that are often brightly colored, aiding in seed dispersal by animals. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in complex inflorescences. Vexibia pachycarpa is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories."
