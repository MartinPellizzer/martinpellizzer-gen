    "intro": "Vitis trifoliata, commonly known as the Japanese grape or three-leaf grape, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Vitis trifoliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile plant for gardens and landscapes."
