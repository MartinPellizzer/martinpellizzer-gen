It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue, elliptical berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
