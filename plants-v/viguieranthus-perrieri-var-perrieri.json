It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Viguieranthus perrieri var. perrieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
