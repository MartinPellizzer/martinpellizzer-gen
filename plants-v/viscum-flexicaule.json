    "intro": "Viscum flexicaule, commonly known as the flexible mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the temperate regions of Europe. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stem, and its flowers are greenish-white with a slight fragrance. The plant produces small, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum flexicaule is often found in forested areas and is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
