    "intro": "Vanilla cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific species of bees. The plant's unique flavor profile comes from the aromatic compounds developed during the curing process of its pods. Its cultivation is challenging due to its specific climatic and ecological requirements. This rare species is valued for its distinct taste and is used in gourmet and artisanal food products."
