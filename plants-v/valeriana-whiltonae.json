    "intro": "Valeriana whiltonae, commonly known as the Whilton's valerian, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
