    "intro": "Vaccinium finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands heath, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the volcanic soils of the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or blue in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
