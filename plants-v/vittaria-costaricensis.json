It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, spiky foliage and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in clusters called sporangia, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Vittaria costaricensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms in its native ecosystem."
