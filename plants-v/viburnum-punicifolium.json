    "intro": "Viburnum punicifolium, commonly known as the scarlet flame bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a reddish hue during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and seasonal color changes. Viburnum punicifolium is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
