It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum aspinum is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies for respiratory ailments."
