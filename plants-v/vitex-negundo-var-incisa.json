    "intro": "Vitex negundo var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vitex or Indian bead tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically lavender to purple in color, arranged in clusters. These flowers give way to small, bead-like fruits that are green when mature and turn brown as they dry. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open areas or along roadsides."
