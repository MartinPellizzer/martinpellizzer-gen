    "intro": "Vigna somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali bean, is a flowering plant species native to the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source. Vigna somaliensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water resources. Its botanical features make it an important plant for both ecological and agricultural purposes in its native habitat."
