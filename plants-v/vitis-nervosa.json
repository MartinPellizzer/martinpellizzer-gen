    "intro": "Vitis nervosa, commonly known as the swamp grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinct network of veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color in the fall. Vitis nervosa thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found near streams or in swampy habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
