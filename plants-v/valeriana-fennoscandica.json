It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots contain volatile oils and alkaloids, contributing to its historical use in traditional medicine. Valeriana fennoscandica is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
