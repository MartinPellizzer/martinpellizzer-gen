    "intro": "Vitis mengziensis, commonly known as Mengzi grapevine, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering vine native to China. It belongs to the Vitaceae family, which includes other well-known grapevines and climbers. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, heart-shaped leaves, and small, greenish-white flowers. It is often found in mountainous regions with moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
