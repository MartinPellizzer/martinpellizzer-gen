    "intro": "Verbascum adenotrichum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum adenotrichum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
