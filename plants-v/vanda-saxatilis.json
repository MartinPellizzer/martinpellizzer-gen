    "intro": "Vanda saxatilis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Vanda saxatilis has a complex root system that helps it anchor in difficult substrates. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, making it a valuable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
