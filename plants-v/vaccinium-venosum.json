    "intro": "Vaccinium venosum, commonly known as the veiny blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with prominent veins, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Vaccinium venosum typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its fruit, a small, blue-black berry, is edible but not as widely cultivated as other blueberry species."
