    "intro": "Vachellia \u00d7 gladiata, commonly known as the African umbrella thorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its long, drooping branches. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets. Vachellia \u00d7 gladiata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
