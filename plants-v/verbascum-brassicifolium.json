    "intro": "Verbascum brassicifolium, commonly known as the yellow mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green, and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun. Its fibrous root system allows it to establish itself in challenging environments, making it a resilient and ornamental species."
