The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet bearing two to three small, bracteate flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in various habitats."
