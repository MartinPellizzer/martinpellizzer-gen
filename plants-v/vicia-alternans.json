    "intro": "Vicia alternans, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often as a weed in agricultural areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant. Vicia alternans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
