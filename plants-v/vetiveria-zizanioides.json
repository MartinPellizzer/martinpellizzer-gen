It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and dense, fibrous root system that can reach depths of up to 10 meters. The plant is highly drought-resistant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for various environmental applications. Its rhizomes are often used in soil stabilization and erosion control due to their extensive underground network. Additionally, vetiver is cultivated for its fragrant leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a natural air freshener."
