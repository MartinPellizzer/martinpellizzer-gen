    "intro": "Vittaria latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features finely divided, arching fronds with a pale, almost translucent appearance, giving it a lace-like texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of root-like structures, which help it anchor to trees or other surfaces. Vittaria latifolia is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings or as a houseplant."
