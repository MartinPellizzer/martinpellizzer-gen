    "intro": "Viola rupestris subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, which become glabrous (smooth) as the plant matures. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive downward-facing structure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and colorful blooms."
