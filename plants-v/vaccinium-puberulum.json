    "intro": "Vaccinium puberulum, commonly known as the smooth blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like heathers and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are usually blue or purple in color. Its leaves are oval and covered with a fine layer of hair, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Vaccinium puberulum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs."
