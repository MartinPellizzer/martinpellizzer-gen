    "intro": "Vaccinium stamineum var. interius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces flowers that are typically pink or white, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife. This variety is closely related to other Vaccinium species but is distinguished by its narrower foliage and specific habitat preferences."
