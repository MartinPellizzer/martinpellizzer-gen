    "intro": "Vitis erythrodes, commonly known as the redstem grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, red berries that ripen in the fall. Vitis erythrodes is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its berries are edible but are typically not cultivated for commercial use due to their tart flavor."
