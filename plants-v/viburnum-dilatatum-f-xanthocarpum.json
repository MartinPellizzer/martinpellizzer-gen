    "intro": "Viburnum dilatatum f. xanthocarpum, commonly known as the yellow-fruited arrowwood, is a botanical variant of the arrowwood viburnum. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange berries, which contrast with the typical red or black fruits of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is native to the eastern United States. Its foliage consists of ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value, particularly for its unique fruit color and adaptability to various garden conditions."
