    "intro": "Viscum austriacum var. pini, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of coniferous trees, primarily pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval leaves and white, sticky berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for birds and other animals. Its life cycle involves both vegetative growth and seed dispersal, often facilitated by birds."
