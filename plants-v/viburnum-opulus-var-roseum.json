    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. roseum, commonly known as the rose-flowered elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, pinkish-white bract-like flowers that appear in late spring, giving it a striking visual display. The plant produces small, dark red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Viburnum opulus var. roseum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
