    "intro": "Veronica forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its small, spurred flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
