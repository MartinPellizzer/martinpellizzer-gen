    "intro": "Viticella heterophylla var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid grape ivy, is a trailing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that vary in size and shape depending on light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental foliage makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and vertical gardens."
