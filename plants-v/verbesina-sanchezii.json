    "intro": "Verbesina sanchezii, commonly known as the S\u00e1nchez's beggar's ticks, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
