    "intro": "Vernonia corymbiformis, commonly known as the clustered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower heads that are typically bright yellow. The plant produces small, narrow leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and prairies, and is often found in areas with well-drained soil. Vernonia corymbiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
