    "intro": "Vulpia alopecuros var. lanata, commonly known as the hairy vulpia, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that are often covered with fine pubescence. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
