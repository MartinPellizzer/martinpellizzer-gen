    "intro": "Vitis acida, commonly known as sour vine, is a species of flowering vine native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into clusters of round, sour-tasting berries. Vitis acida is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other members of the Vitaceae family."
