    "intro": "Vandopsis muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's vandopsis, is a rare and enigmatic fern native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Vandaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other vandaceous ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common to many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vandopsis muelleri is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
