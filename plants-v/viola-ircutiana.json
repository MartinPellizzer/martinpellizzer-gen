    "intro": "Viola ircutiana, commonly known as the Turkish violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to retain moisture. Viola ircutiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
