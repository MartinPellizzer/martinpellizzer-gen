    "intro": "Vanda luzonica, commonly known as the Luzon vanda, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, fleshy roots and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and bloom during the summer months. Vanda luzonica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
