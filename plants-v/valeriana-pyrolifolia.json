    "intro": "Valeriana pyrolifolia, commonly known as the alpine valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Valeriana pyrolifolia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties."
