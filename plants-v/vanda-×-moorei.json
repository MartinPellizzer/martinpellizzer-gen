    "intro": "Vanda \u00d7 moorei, commonly known as the Moore's vanda, is a hybrid orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet, often in clusters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and leathery, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Vanda \u00d7 moorei thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
