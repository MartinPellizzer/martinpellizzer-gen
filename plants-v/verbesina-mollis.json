    "intro": "Verbesina mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf or yellow beggar-ticks, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Verbesina mollis is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
