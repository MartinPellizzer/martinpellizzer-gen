    "intro": "Viola arvensis subsp. megalantha, commonly known as the large-flowered violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy violet flowers that are typically larger than those of other viola species. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The flowers bloom in early spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
