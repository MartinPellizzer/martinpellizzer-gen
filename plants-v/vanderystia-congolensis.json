    "intro": "Vanderystia congolensis, commonly known as the Congo violet, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in undergrowth vegetation. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
