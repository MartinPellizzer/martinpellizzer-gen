It belongs to the family Podostomaceae and is characterized by its specialized adaptations to aquatic environments. The plant typically grows along the banks of slow-moving streams and has a distinctive, flattened, ribbon-like structure. Its leaves are often submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for aquatic pollination. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
