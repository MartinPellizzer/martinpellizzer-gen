    "intro": "Vincetoxicum tylophoroides, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. It is often found in dry slopes and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil. The seeds are encased in a pod and dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in suitable habitats."
