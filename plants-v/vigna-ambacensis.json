    "intro": "Vigna ambacensis, commonly known as the African cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vigna ambacensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited rainfall. Its seeds are edible and are often used in local cuisines, while the plant also serves as forage for livestock."
