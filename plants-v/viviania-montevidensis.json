    "intro": "Viviania montevidensis, commonly known as the Uruguay nettle, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its stinging hairs, it can be difficult to handle without protection."
