    "intro": "Viburnum nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum nervosum thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which attract wildlife."
