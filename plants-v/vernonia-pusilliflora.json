    "intro": "Vernonia pusilliflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and forest edges. It produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps distinguish it from similar species."
