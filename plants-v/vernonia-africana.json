    "intro": "Vernonia africana, commonly known as African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Vernonia africana is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional medicinal uses in some African cultures."
