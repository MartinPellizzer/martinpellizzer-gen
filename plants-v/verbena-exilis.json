    "intro": "Verbena exilis, commonly known as slender verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Verbena exilis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
