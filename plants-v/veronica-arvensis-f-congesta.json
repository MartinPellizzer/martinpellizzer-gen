It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. It is part of the Plantaginaceae family, which includes other members like the common speedwell. The compact form of this cultivar makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders, adding a delicate ornamental touch to garden landscapes."
