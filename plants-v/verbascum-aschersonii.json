    "intro": "Verbascum aschersonii, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Verbascum aschersonii is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native range."
