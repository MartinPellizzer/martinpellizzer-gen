    "intro": "Verbesina microcarpa, commonly known as the littleleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds with tiny hooks, aiding in seed dispersal. Verbesina microcarpa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
