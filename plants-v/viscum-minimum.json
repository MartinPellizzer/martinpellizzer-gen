    "intro": "Viscum minimum, commonly known as dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, while also producing its own food through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries. Viscum minimum is often found in temperate regions and is a common component of forest ecosystems."
