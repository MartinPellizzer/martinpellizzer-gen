    "intro": "Vigna pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bean or small cowpea, is a small, annual legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height, and produces small, pod-like fruits containing one to three seeds. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Vigna pusilla is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in dry conditions, making it a hardy crop in many environments. Its seeds are often used as a food source, either cooked or ground into flour."
