    "intro": "Viola hederacea subsp. hederacea, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces violet or purple flowers with five petals, often with a yellow or white mark at the base. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The species is noted for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation."
