It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark blue, waxy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and unique floral display."
