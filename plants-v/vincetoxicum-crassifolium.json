    "intro": "Vincetoxicum crassifolium, commonly known as broadleaf snakeroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically rough to the touch and have a distinct, bitter aroma. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its toxic properties have historically made it a plant of both caution and traditional use."
