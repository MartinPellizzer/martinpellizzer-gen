    "intro": "Vitis novemfolia, commonly known as the nineleaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically have nine leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Vitis novemfolia is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its historical use by indigenous peoples for food and medicine highlights its ecological and cultural significance."
