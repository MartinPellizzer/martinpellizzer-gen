    "intro": "Vanilla pfaviana, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a climbing vine that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers, which eventually develop into the characteristic vanilla pods. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a specific symbiotic relationship with certain fungi for its growth. Its vanilla pods are harvested and processed to extract the aromatic compound vanillin. This species is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ecological and botanical significance in its native habitat."
