    "intro": "Vernonia perparva, commonly known as the small ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Vernonia perparva is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
