    "intro": "Verbena tenera, commonly known as the sticky verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, woody stems covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming throughout the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs that give them a sticky texture. Verbena tenera is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
