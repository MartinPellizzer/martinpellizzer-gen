    "intro": "Vachellia haematoxylon, commonly known as Indian sandalwood, is a leguminous tree native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces long, straight pods containing seeds, and its wood is highly valued for its aromatic, durable quality. The heartwood contains a reddish pigment called haematoxylon, which has been used historically in dyes, perfumes, and traditional medicines. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions."
