    "intro": "Veronica spicata var. persicifolia, commonly known as the Persian speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its compact size and long-lasting blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
