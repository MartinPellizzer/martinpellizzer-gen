    "intro": "Vriesea capituligera var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow-leafed vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a tall, upright stem with broad, strap-like leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow or orange in color. The plant produces a branched inflorescence with small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
