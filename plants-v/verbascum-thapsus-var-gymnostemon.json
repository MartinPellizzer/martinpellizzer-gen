    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus var. gymnostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, velvety leaves that are narrower than the typical variety. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variant is notable for its reduced leaf size and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
