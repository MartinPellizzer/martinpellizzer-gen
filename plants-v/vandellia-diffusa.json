    "intro": "Vandellia diffusa, commonly known as the green vandellia, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Vandellia diffusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens for its unique foliage."
