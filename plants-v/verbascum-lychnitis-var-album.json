    "intro": "Verbascum lychnitis var. album, commonly known as the white mullein, is a biennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its common name derives from its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
