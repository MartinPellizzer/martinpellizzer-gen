    "intro": "Vernonia rufogrisea, commonly known as the redgray ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, pale yellow to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across open habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vernonia rufogrisea is often found in prairies, woodlands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
