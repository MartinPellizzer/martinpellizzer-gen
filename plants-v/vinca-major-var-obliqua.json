    "intro": "Vinca major var. obliqua, commonly known as the spreading greater periwinkle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dense, evergreen foliage that forms a thick mat on the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to suppress weeds. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for landscaping in woodland gardens and shaded borders."
