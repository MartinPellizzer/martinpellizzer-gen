    "intro": "Vicia lagopus, commonly known as the snow vetcher, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia lagopus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
