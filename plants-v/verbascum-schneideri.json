It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in soft, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.
