    "intro": "Vriesea broadwayi, commonly known as the Broadway Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with clusters of colorful, long-lasting flowers that range from yellow to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea broadwayi is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
