    "intro": "Vicia semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Vicia semenovii is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
