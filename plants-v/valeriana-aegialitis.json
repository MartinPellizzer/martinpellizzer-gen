It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in late summer. Valeriana aegialitis is adapted to salty and windy environments, making it a characteristic species of coastal vegetation."
