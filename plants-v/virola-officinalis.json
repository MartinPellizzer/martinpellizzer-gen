It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, simple leaves. The tree produces fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing sticky, resinous seeds.

Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
