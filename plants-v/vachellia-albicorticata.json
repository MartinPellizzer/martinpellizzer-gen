    "intro": "Vachellia albicorticata, commonly known as the white-barked acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The white bark is a distinguishing feature, giving the plant its common name."
