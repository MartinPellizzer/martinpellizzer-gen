    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica var. terrea, commonly known as the terrestrial waterhen plant, is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to retain moisture in wet environments. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks."
