    "intro": "Vachellia reficiens, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by multiple branches that spread outward. The plant has small, compound leaves that are often reduced to spines, a feature common in drought-adapted species. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Vachellia reficiens is well adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia."
