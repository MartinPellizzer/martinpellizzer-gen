    "intro": "Vriesea medusa, commonly known as the Medusa Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky inflorescence that resembles the mythological figure of Medusa, giving it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central reservoir. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are borne on a tall, branched stem. Vriesea medusa thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
