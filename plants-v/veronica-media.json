    "intro": "Veronica media, commonly known as common speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue or violet flowers. The plant typically blooms from spring to early summer, producing small, five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well. Veronica media is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, making it a common weed in many regions."
