    "intro": "Vitaliana primuliflora var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf vitaliana, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its unique foliage makes it a striking addition to gardens, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
