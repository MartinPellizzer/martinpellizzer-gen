It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance plant for botanical gardens and private collections."
