    "intro": "Vicia dennesiana, commonly known as the Dennes' vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in early spring. Vicia dennesiana is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
