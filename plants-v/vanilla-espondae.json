    "intro": "Vanilla espondae, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. Its most notable feature is the development of a vanilla pod, which is harvested and used in flavoring and fragrance industries. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Vanilla espondae is considered a rare and endangered species."
