    "intro": "Vernonia ursicola, commonly known as the bear's milk bush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bracts that are often mistaken for petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. Vernonia ursicola thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
