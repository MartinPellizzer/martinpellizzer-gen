    "intro": "Vallea cernua, commonly known as the drooping beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodland edges and thickets. Vallea cernua is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
