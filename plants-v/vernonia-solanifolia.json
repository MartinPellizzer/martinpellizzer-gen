    "intro": "Vernonia solanifolia, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, violet-blue flower heads that resemble those of the coneflower genus. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in dense, conical inflorescences at the tips of the branches. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough, hairy texture. Vernonia solanifolia is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and attractive addition to native plant gardens."
