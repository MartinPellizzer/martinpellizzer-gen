    "intro": "Vanilla griffithii var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Taiwan. It produces fragrant, dark brown pods that are harvested for their vanilla-like aroma. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates. It requires a support structure to climb and is often found in forest understories. The vanilla flavor of its pods is less intense compared to commercial vanilla, but it is still valued in traditional uses."
