    "intro": "Viola coronifera var. minoriflora, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
