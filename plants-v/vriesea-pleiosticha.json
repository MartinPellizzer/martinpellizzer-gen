It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its inflorescence is often multi-branched, with numerous flowers arranged in a compact, showy cluster. Vriesea pleiosticha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant."
