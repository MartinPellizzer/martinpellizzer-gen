    "intro": "Vitis acetosa, commonly known as sourvines or wild grapevines, is a perennial climbing vine native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Vitis acetosa is often found in damp, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
