    "intro": "Viguiera ciliata, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a perennial plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its bright orange to red composite flower heads, which resemble those of sunflowers, and its finely hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. It produces cylindrical, spiny seed pods that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Viguiera ciliata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
