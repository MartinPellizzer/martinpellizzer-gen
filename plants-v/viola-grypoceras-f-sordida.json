    "intro": "Viola grypoceras f. sordida, commonly known as the sordid viola, is a rare and intriguing botanical variant within the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost sooty foliage and muted, less vibrant floral colors compared to typical viola species. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, downy hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
