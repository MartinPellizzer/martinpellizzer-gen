    "intro": "Vaccinium garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other species in the Vaccinium genus. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
