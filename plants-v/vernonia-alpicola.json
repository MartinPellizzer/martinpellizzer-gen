    "intro": "Vernonia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh climates. The bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
