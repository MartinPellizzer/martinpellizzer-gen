    "intro": "Vernonia giorgii, commonly known as the giant ironweed, is a tall, erect perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow to orange-red flower heads. The plant typically grows up to 6 feet tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves and sturdy, branching stems. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia giorgii is often found in wetland habitats, including swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
