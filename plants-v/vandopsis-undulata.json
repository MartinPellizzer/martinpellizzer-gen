    "intro": "Vandopsis undulata, commonly known as the undulating vandopsis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Vandopsis undulata is considered a species of conservation concern."
