    "intro": "Vicia cracca, commonly known as the common vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Vicia cracca is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration and agricultural systems. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
