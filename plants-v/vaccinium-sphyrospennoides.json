    "intro": "Vaccinium sphyrospennoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are typically red or black when mature, are edible and contain high levels of antioxidants. This species thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
