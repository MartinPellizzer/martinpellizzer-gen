    "intro": "Vilfa rhizomatosa, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, violet-blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
