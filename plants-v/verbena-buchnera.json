    "intro": "Verbena buchnera, commonly known as the rock verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Verbena buchnera is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
