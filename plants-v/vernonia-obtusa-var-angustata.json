It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, dark purple to violet composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
