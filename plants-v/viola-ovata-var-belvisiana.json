It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters, with upright stems and clustered inflorescences. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
