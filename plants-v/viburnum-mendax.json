    "intro": "Viburnum mendax, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright purple berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Viburnum mendax typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
