    "intro": "Vitis quelpaertensis, commonly known as the Jeju grapevine, is a rare and endemic species native to Jeju Island, South Korea. It is a deciduous vine that produces small, dark purple berries, which are typically used in local winemaking. The plant has a distinctive heart-shaped leaf and thrives in the unique microclimate of Jeju's volcanic soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected under South Korean law. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic uniqueness and ecological role in the region's biodiversity."
