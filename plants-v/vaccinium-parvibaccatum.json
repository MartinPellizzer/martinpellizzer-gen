    "intro": "Vaccinium parvibaccatum, commonly known as the small-fruited blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Its berries, which are typically blue or black when ripe, are edible and contain high levels of antioxidants. Vaccinium parvibaccatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments."
