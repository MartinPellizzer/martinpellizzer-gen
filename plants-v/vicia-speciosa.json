It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive purple or pink flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Vicia speciosa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
