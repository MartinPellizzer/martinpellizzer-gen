    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 lavandulacea, commonly known as the lavender viola, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Viola wittrockii and Viola lutea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is primarily propagated through seed or cuttings."
