    "intro": "Veltis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like covering, which aids in their dispersal. Veltis is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas, where it can become invasive in some regions."
