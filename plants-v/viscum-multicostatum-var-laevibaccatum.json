    "intro": "Viscum multicostatum var. laevibaccatum, commonly known as the smooth-bacca mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients. It is native to parts of eastern Asia, including China and Japan, where it typically grows on species of the genus Ficus. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain sticky seeds, aiding in its dispersal by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
