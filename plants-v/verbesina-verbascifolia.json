    "intro": "Verbesina verbascifolia, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features showy yellow ray flowers surrounded by a dense, woolly layer of fine, white to grayish hairs. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in similar soft, fuzzy hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
