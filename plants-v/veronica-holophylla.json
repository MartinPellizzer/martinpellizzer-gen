    "intro": "Veronica holophylla, commonly known as the mountain veronica, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Veronica holophylla is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
