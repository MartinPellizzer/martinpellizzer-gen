    "intro": "Viola hederacea var. petiolaris, commonly known as the trailing violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing along forest floors or in wet meadows. Its trailing habit makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
