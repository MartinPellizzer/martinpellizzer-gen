    "intro": "Valota laxa, commonly known as the lax valerian, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in pairs along the stems. Valota laxa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
