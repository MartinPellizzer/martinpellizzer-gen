    "intro": "Vriesea altimontana, commonly known as the Montane Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height, displaying a variety of colors including red, orange, and yellow. The plant has broad, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea altimontana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
