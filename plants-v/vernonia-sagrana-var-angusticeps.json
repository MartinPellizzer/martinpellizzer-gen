    "intro": "Vernonia sagrana var. angusticeps, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, dark purple to brown flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the plant often grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and streambanks. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
