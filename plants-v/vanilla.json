    "intro": "Vanilla, commonly known as the orchid *Vanilla planifolia*, is a tropical vine native to Mexico and Central America. Its flowers are pollinated by a specific species of bee, which is rarely found outside its native habitat, making natural vanilla production challenging. The vanilla bean, which develops from the flower after hand-pollination, is harvested and cured through a process of drying and sweating to develop its characteristic aroma. The plant's fragrant pods contain essential oils and compounds like vanillin, which are responsible for its rich flavor. Vanilla is now cultivated worldwide, but its unique botanical and agricultural requirements make it a prized and complex crop."
