    "intro": "Vignea arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Vignea arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
