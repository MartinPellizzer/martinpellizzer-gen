    "intro": "Vitex acuminata, commonly known as the chaste tree or common vitex, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, blue or purple flowers in panicles, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases small, smooth seeds. Vitex acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
