    "intro": "Vitis pisicarpa, commonly known as the grapefruit vine, is a rare and less-studied member of the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to\u6500\u9644 various structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, orange-red fruits that are not typically consumed by humans. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five lobes and a distinctive, aromatic odor. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
