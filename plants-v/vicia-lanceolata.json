    "intro": "Vicia lanceolata, commonly known as narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Vicia lanceolata is typically found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry, open habitats. It is also used in some traditional herbal remedies due to its potential medicinal properties."
