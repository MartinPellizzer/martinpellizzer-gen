    "intro": "Valeriana rigida, commonly known as stiff valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often strongly scented leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Valeriana rigida is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects."
