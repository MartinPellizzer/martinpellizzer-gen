    "intro": "Vittaria subcoriacea, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its soft, velvety fronds. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, hairy texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. Vittaria subcoriacea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories."
