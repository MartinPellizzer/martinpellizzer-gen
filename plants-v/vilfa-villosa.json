    "intro": "Vilfa villosa, commonly known as the hairy vilfa, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Vilfa villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
