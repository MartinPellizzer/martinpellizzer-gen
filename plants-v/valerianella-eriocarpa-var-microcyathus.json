    "intro": "Valerianella eriocarpa var. microcyathus, commonly known as dwarf valerian, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Valerianella eriocarpa var. microcyathus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
