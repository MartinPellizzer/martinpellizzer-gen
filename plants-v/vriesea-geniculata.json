    "intro": "Vriesea geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag bromeliad, is a species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, recurved leaf rosette that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, colorful bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea geniculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
