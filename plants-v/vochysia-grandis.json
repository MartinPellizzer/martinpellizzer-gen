It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Vochysia grandis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has traditional uses in construction and furniture-making."
