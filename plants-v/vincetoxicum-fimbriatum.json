    "intro": "Vincetoxicum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringeleaf false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in partial shade. Vincetoxicum fimbriatum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through its berries."
