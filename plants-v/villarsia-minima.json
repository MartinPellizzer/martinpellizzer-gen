    "intro": "Villarsia minima, commonly known as the dwarf villarsia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
