    "intro": "Viburnum apiculatum, commonly known as the Canadian arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Viburnum apiculatum thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and colorful fruits, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
