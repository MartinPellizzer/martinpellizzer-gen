    "intro": "Vanda wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's vanda, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Vanda wightiana is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for both horticultural and ornamental purposes."
