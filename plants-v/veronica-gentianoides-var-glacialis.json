It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
