    "intro": "Vicia cordata, commonly known as heartleaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically trifoliate, consisting of three oval leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Vicia cordata is a perennial legume that plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
