    "intro": "Vitis vinifera f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple grapevine, is a cultivar of the common grapevine characterized by its distinctive purple foliage and berries. This variety is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production. The leaves are typically a deep purple or maroon color, which contrasts beautifully with the green of surrounding vegetation. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight. The plant is often used in landscaping and can be trained as a vine or shrub."
