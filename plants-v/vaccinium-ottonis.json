    "intro": "Vaccinium ottonis, commonly known as the Otto's blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. These flowers give way to small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. Vaccinium ottonis thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
