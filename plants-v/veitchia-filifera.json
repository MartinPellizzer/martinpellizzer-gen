    "intro": "Veitchia filifera, commonly known as the threadleaf cycad, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that are narrow and feather-like. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a landscape plant."
