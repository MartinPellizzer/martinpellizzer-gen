    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica var. lancifolia, commonly known as water speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ponds, or in marshy areas. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
