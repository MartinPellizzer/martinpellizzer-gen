The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, often in regions with well-drained soils. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its arid or semi-arid environment. Vittadinia hispidula is an important component of local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
