    "intro": "Vitis rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated grape, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and its ability to climb using tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated edge, and the vines can reach lengths of up to 15 feet. Vitis rostrata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
