    "intro": "Viguiera ensifolia, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy, often purple or pink blooms. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Viguiera ensifolia is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
