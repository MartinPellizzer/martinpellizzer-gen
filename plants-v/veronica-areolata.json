    "intro": "Veronica areolata, commonly known as the cushion veronica, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
