    "intro": "Viburnum foetidum var. foetidum, commonly known as stinkbush or swamp viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is limited due to its strong, unpleasant odor, but it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
