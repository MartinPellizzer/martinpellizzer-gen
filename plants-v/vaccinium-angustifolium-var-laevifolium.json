    "intro": "Vaccinium angustifolium var. laevifolium, commonly known as the lowbush blueberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which develop into the familiar blue-black berries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are widely used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woods."
