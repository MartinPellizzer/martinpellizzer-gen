    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 sublasianthum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for gardens and natural habitats. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattifolium, contributing to its unique botanical traits."
