    "intro": "Vanilla uncinata, commonly known as the climbing vanilla orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a perennial vine that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers followed by long, thin pods. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a support structure to climb. Its pods, which mature to a dark brown color, are harvested for their aromatic seeds used in culinary and perfumery applications. The botanical characteristics of Vanilla uncinata make it distinct from the more widely cultivated Vanilla planifolia."
