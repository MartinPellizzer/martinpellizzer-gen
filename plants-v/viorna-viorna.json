    "intro": "Viorna viorna, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health."
