    "intro": "Verbesina hygrophila, commonly known as swamp beggarticks, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in moist or swampy soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy habitats. Its common name reflects its association with waterlogged environments and its prickly, hairy stems."
