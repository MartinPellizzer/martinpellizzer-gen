    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. apiana, commonly known as the Apian grape, is a lesser-known variety of grape native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, intensely flavored berries that are often used in the production of high-quality wines. The plant typically grows as a vigorous vine with compound leaves and clusters of small, dark-colored fruits. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a long growing season. Due to its rarity and unique flavor profile, it is highly valued by viticulturists and wine enthusiasts alike."
