    "intro": "Vernonia angustifolia subsp. scaberrima, commonly known as the rough vernonia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native range."
