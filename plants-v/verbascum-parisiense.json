    "intro": "Verbascum parisiense, commonly known as the Paris mullein, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum parisiense is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including roadsides and meadows."
