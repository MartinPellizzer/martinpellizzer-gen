    "intro": "Vepris fitoravina, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, round, reddish-brown fruits that contain winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered."
