    "intro": "Vicia variegata subsp. variegata, commonly known as the variegated vetch, is a herbaceous legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with distinctive white and green variegation, and its small, pea-like flowers are typically pink or violet in color. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. Vicia variegata subsp. variegata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
