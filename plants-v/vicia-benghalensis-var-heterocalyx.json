It features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are typically pink to purple, arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, and are borne on elongated peduncles. Its root system fixes nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and agricultural systems. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
