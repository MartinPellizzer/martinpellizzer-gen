    "intro": "Vernonia rugosifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and dry slopes. Its flowering period attracts various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Vernonia rugosifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings."
