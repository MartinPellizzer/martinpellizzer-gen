    "intro": "Vernonia karstenii, commonly known as Karsten's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, and it produces showy, purple or pinkish flower clusters in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to wet soil conditions. Vernonia karstenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
