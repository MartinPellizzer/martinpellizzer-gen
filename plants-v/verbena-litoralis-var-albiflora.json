    "intro": "Verbena litoralis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sea verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern California. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features slender stems and small, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is well adapted to salt spray and is often found in dune ecosystems."
