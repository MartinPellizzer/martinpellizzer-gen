    "intro": "Vangueria mollis, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Vangueria mollis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
