    "intro": "Verbascum spectabile, commonly known as the tall mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, fuzzy gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, terminal spike. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in soft, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Verbascum spectabile is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
