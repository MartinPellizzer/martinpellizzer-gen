It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its unique, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are often pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species."
