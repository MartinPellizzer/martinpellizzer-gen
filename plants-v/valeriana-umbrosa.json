    "intro": "Valeriana umbrosa, commonly known as shadow valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy taste. Valeriana umbrosa thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinct, aromatic scent when crushed."
