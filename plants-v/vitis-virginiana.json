    "intro": "Vitis virginiana, commonly known as wild grape, is a deciduous vine native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that turn from green to red or black as they mature. Vitis virginiana thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and along stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
