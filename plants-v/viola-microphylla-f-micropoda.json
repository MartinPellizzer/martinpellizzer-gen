    "intro": "Viola microphylla f. micropoda, commonly known as the miniature violet, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are densely packed, giving the plant a lush, bushy appearance. The flowers are typically violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive yellow center, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its delicate size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
