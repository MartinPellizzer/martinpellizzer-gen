    "intro": "Viola brainerdii, commonly known as Brainerd's violet, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers with yellow markings. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered inflorescence. Due to habitat loss, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to survive."
