    "intro": "Valeriana collina, commonly known as bluebug or mountain valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branching stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Valeriana collina is known for its strong, often pleasant fragrance, which is attributed to its essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes."
