    "intro": "Vachellia yemenensis, commonly known as Yemen acacia, is a leguminous shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, followed by long, flat pods containing compressed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Vachellia yemenensis is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
