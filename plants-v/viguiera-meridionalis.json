    "intro": "Viguiera meridionalis, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features upright stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It produces clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Viguiera meridionalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water."
