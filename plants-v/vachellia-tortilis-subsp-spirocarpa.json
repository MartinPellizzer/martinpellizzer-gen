    "intro": "Vachellia tortilis subsp. spirocarpa, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its spreading branches. The plant has compound leaves that are typically reduced to small spines, with the remaining foliage being small and feathery. It produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. This species is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing capabilities through its root nodules."
