It is characterized by its silvery-gray, pubescent leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in local cuisine. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in coniferous or mixed forests. This variety is closely related to other Vaccinium species and is valued for both its ornamental and culinary uses."
