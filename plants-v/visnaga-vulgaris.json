    "intro": "Visnaga vulgaris, commonly known as the common fennel, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a tall, slender stem and feathery, finely divided leaves that are aromatic and often used in cooking. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which eventually develop into seeds enclosed in a bract. Its roots and seeds contain volatile oils, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. Visnaga vulgaris is also known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
