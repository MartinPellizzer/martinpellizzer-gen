    "intro": "Vittaria gardneriana, commonly known as the Gardner's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, spiky formations along the leaf margins. Vittaria gardneriana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
