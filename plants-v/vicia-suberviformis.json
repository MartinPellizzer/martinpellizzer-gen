    "intro": "Vicia suberviformis, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers. The plant produces slender, twisting pods that contain several small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Vicia suberviformis has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
