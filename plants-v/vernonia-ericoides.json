    "intro": "Vernonia ericoides, commonly known as the coastal ironweed, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Vernonia ericoides is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
