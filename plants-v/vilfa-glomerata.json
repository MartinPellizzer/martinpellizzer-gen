    "intro": "Vilfa glomerata, commonly known as the clustered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, cylindrical pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
