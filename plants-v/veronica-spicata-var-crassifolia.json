    "intro": "Veronica spicata var. crassifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikes of blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
