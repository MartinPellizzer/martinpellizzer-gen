    "intro": "Veronica grandis var. pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscape designs."
