    "intro": "Vatica moonii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and glossy in appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, Vatica moonii is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
