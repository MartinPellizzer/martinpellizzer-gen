    "intro": "Virgularia revoluta, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a rosette growth habit, with leaves that are often rolled or revolute, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind and water. Virgularia revoluta is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
