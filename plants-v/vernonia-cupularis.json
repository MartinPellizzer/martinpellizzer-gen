    "intro": "Vernonia cupularis, commonly known as the cupular Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small cones. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive cup-like structure. Vernonia cupularis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
