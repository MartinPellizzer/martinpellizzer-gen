    "intro": "Verbena scrobiculata, commonly known as the sticky verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique sticky secretions on the leaves and stems help deter herbivores and reduce water loss."
