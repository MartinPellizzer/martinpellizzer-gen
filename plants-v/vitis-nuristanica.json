    "intro": "Vitis nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan grape, is a lesser-known species of vine native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan. It belongs to the Vitaceae family, which includes many vine species known for their edible fruits. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, similar to other grape species. Vitis nuristanica is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to attach to supports. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
