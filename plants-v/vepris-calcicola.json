    "intro": "Vepris calcicola, commonly known as the limestone vepris, is a shrub native to the limestone regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its adaptability to poor, calcareous soils makes it a notable species in rocky and arid environments. The plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
