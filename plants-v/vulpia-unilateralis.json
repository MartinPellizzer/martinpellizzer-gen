    "intro": "Vulpia unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided vulpia, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a slender, erect stem with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas quickly. Vulpia unilateralis is often found in open, sunny habitats and is relatively resilient to environmental stress."
