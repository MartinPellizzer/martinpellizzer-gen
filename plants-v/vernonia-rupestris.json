    "intro": "Vernonia rupestris, commonly known as the rock Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. Vernonia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
