    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 braunii, commonly known as the velvetleaf viola, is a hybrid perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green in color and its clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches and prefers well-drained, moist soil in partial shade. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to thrive in cooler climates. Viola \u00d7 braunii is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
