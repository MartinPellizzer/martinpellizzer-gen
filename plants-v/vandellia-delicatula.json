    "intro": "Vandellia delicatula, commonly known as the glassy frog, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is a type of bromeliad, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is known for its striking, translucent appearance. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Vandellia delicatula is often found growing on trees or rocks, where it can access the moisture and light it needs to survive."
