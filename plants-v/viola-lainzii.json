    "intro": "Viola lainzii, commonly known as the Lainz violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, showy flowers that range in color from purple to violet, often with intricate patterns. Viola lainzii is characterized by its short, upright stems and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in cooler climates."
