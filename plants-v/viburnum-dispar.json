    "intro": "Viburnum dispar, commonly known as the dwarf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clustered panicles during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes that persist into winter, providing food for wildlife. Viburnum dispar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
