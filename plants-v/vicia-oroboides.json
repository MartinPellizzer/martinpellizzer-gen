    "intro": "Vicia oroboides, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its trailing stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia oroboides is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in alpine and subalpine regions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
