It features small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has prostrate or spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in garden and natural landscapes."
