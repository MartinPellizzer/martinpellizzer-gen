    "intro": "Veronica ciliaris, commonly known as the silverweed or silver leaf veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Veronica ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
