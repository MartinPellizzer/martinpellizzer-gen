    "intro": "Volutaria lippii subsp. tubuliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vernal grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and northern regions of North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems with alternate, narrow, and lance-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in clusters, producing small, tubular flowers that are often visited by pollinators. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its native range."
