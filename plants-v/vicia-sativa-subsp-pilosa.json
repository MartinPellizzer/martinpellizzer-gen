It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Hairy vetch is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable cover crop in agricultural systems. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used for erosion control and soil enrichment."
