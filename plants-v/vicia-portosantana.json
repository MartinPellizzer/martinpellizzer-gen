    "intro": "Vicia portosantana, commonly known as the Portosantana vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia portosantana is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
