It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Verbena diversifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
