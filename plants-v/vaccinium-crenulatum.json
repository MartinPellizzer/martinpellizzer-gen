    "intro": "Vaccinium crenulatum, commonly known as the creeping blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring. The plant bears edible, dark blue berries that are typically harvested in the summer months. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often used in native plant landscaping. Vaccinium crenulatum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
