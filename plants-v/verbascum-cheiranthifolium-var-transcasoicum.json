    "intro": "Verbascum cheiranthifolium var. transcasoicum, commonly known as the Transcaspian mullein, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments."
