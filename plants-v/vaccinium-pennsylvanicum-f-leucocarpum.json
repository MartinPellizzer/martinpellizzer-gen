    "intro": "Vaccinium pennsylvanicum f. leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited blueberry, is a variant of the highbush blueberry native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its white or pale blue berries, which contrast with the typical purple or blue fruits of the species. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in woodland habitats. It has erect, branched stems with alternate, oval-shaped leaves. The flowers are small and white, producing the distinctive pale fruits that are often used in local foraging and culinary applications."
