    "intro": "Viguiera laxicymosa, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its yellow to orange flower heads bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera laxicymosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
