    "intro": "Viburnum sympodiale, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright purple, berry-like fruits. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Viburnum sympodiale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
