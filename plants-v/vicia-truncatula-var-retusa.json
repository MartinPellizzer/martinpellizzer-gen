    "intro": "Vicia truncatula var. retusa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces pods containing several small, dark seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its growth habit includes sprawling stems that can reach up to two meters in length."
