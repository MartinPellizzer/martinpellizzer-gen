    "intro": "Vriesea ororiensis, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red inflorescence that resembles a torch, which blooms for several months. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a common adaptation in bromeliads. Its foliage is often a deep green with reddish veins, adding to its ornamental appeal. Vriesea ororiensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish."
