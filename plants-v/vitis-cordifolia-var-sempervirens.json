    "intro": "Vitis cordifolia var. sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen grapevine, is a variant of the heart-leaved grapevine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its persistent foliage, which remains green throughout the year, distinguishing it from other grapevine species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that give way to edible berries, though these are typically not cultivated for consumption. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a glossy surface, and its vines can climb using tendrils. This species thrives in moist, wooded environments and is often found in the understory of forests."
