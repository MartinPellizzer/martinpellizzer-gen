    "intro": "Vietnamia, commonly known as the Vietnamese orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have pseudobulbs and are adapted to grow in humid, tropical environments. Vietnamia species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses. However, due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species are now threatened with extinction."
