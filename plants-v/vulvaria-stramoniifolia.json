    "intro": "Vulvaria stramoniifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides. It has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vulvaria stramoniifolia is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
