    "intro": "Vitis canina, commonly known as the dog grape, is a species of flowering vine native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and its small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green berries that are typically not consumed by humans but are used in traditional medicine. Vitis canina is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist, shady areas. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies and historical botany."
