    "intro": "Vanilla ponapensis, commonly known as the Caroline vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the Caroline Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is a climbing vine that produces fragrant, dark brown pods, which are the source of its name. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with ample sunlight and well-draining soil. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, typical of many orchid species. The vanilla pods are harvested when mature and dried to develop their characteristic aroma and flavor."
