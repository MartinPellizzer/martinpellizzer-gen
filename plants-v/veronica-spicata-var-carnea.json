It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, soft down. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
