    "intro": "Vitis sinuosa, commonly known as the waxy vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its waxy, light green leaves that are often curled or sinuate, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, edible berries in the fall. Vitis sinuosa is typically found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it climbs trees or shrubs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
