    "intro": "Vicia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Vicia parviflora is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
