    "intro": "Vitis ternata, commonly known as the creeping grape or Japanese climbing vine, is a perennial vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of black, edible berries. Vitis ternata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
