    "intro": "Vaccinium lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like heather and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which eventually develop into edible berries. Its leaves are lanceolate, hence the species name, and are typically dark green with a leathery texture. Vaccinium lanceolatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps."
