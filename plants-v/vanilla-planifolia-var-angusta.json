    "intro": "Vanilla planifolia var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vanilla, is a tropical orchid native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. Its fruit, a pod-like structure, develops after successful pollination and is harvested for its aromatic vanilla extract. This variety is less commonly cultivated than the standard vanilla planifolia but is valued for its unique flavor profile."
