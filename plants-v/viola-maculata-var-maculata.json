It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive purple or brown marking on the underside. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of violet, yellow, and white, often with a dark eye-like marking. It thrives in cool climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Viola maculata var. maculata is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread through self-seeding."
