    "intro": "Vilfa luxurians, commonly known as the Emerald Veil, is a striking plant native to the misty highlands of the eastern continent. It features broad, waxy leaves that shimmer with a bioluminescent glow during twilight hours. The plant's flowers are small, star-shaped, and emit a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are fibrous and capable of absorbing moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Due to its rarity and unique properties, Vilfa luxurians is highly valued in both botanical research and magical applications."
