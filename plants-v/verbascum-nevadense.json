It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in height. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats like meadows and rocky slopes. Verbascum nevadense is adapted to arid environments and is often found in areas with well-drained soils."
