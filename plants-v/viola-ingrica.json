    "intro": "Viola ingrica, commonly known as the slender violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or violet. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Viola ingrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
