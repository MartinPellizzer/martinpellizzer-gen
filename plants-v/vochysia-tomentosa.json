    "intro": "Vochysia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sycamore, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, white pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique foliage and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
