    "intro": "Vernonia aschenborniana, commonly known as the desert false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. It produces seeds in small, disk-like flower heads, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
