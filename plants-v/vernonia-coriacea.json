It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flower heads. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Vernonia coriacea is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects.
