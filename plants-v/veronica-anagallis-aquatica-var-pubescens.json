    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water speedwell, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found along the edges of ponds, ditches, and stream banks. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
