    "intro": "Varronia lantanifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf varronia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its small, white to yellowish flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Varronia lantanifolia is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
