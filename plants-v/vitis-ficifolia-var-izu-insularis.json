    "intro": "Vitis ficifolia var. izu-insularis, commonly known as the Izu Islands grape, is a rare and endemic vine species native to the Izu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into dark purple to black berries, which are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
