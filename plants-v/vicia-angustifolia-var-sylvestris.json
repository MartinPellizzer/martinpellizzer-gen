    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild narrow-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, showing adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its root system fixes nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. The seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, aiding in its persistence in natural habitats."
