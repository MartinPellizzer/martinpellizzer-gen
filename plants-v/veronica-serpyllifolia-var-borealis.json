    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia var. borealis, commonly known as northern speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer, typically from June to August. The plant has thin, sprawling stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other varieties of Veronica serpyllifolia."
