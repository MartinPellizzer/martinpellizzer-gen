    "intro": "Veratrum alpestre, commonly known as alpine veratrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often adorned with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, adapted to the harsh, cold environments of its native habitat. Veratrum alpestre contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both ecological and medicinal significance."
