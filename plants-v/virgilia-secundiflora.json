    "intro": "Virgilia secundiflora, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globe-shaped, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its root system is adapted to deep soil layers, allowing it to access water during dry periods. Virgilia secundiflora plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
