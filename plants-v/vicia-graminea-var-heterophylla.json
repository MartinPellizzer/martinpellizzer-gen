    "intro": "Vicia graminea var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either trifoliate or pinnate depending on the environment. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically violet or pink in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
