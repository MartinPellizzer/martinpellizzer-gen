    "intro": "Vulpia ciliata subsp. aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of cilia. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Vulpia ciliata subsp. aetnensis plays a role in stabilizing soil on rocky slopes and is an indicator species of volcanic ecosystems."
