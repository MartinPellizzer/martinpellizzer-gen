    "intro": "Vicia lutea, commonly known as yellow vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many leguminous species. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has a climbing habit, supported by tendrils that allow it to ascend structures or other vegetation. Vicia lutea is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
