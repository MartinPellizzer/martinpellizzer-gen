    "intro": "Vaccinium brachytrichum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or dark purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it has short, stiff hairs on its stems, giving it its scientific name. This species is an important component of the vegetation in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems."
