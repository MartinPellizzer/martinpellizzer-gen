It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Vellozia nivea is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its distinctive appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat."
