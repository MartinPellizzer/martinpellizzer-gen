    "intro": "Vicia leucomalla, commonly known as the white vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several oblong seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Vicia leucomalla is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
