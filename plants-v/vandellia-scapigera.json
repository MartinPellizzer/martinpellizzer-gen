    "intro": "Vandellia scapigera, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Vandellia scapigera is considered a species of conservation concern."
