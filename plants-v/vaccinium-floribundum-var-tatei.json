    "intro": "Vaccinium floribundum var. tatei, commonly known as the Tate's huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. These flowers give way to edible berries that are typically red or purple, containing a high concentration of antioxidants. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas."
