    "intro": "Vriesea sanguinolenta, commonly known as the red-veined vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that are often streaked with red or orange veins. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences that can be yellow, orange, or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea sanguinolenta is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
