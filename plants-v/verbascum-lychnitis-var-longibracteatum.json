    "intro": "Verbascum lychnitis var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is noted for its distinctive bracts that are longer than those of the typical species, giving it a unique appearance."
