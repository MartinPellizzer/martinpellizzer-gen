    "intro": "Verbascum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, silky white hairs that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose, sparsely branched inflorescences. Its leaves are large, broad, and lance-shaped, with prominent veins and a waxy texture. Verbascum auriculatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
