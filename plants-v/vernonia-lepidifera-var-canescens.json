    "intro": "Vernonia lepidifera var. canescens, commonly known as the silver vernonia, is a shrub native to the eastern and southern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from densely packed fine hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
