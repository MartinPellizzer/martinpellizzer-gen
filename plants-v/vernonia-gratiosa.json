    "intro": "Vernonia gratiosa, commonly known as the golden ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flower heads. The plant produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Vernonia gratiosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
