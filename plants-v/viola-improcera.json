    "intro": "Viola improcera, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat."
