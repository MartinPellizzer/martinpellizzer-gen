    "intro": "Viscum randiae, commonly known as the Rand's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host tree's bark. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects, despite its toxic properties. Viscum randiae is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in humid, forested environments."
