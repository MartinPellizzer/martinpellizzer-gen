    "intro": "Vitis potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's grape, is a rare and lesser-known species of vine native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its berries are usually small and dark in hue, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vitis potaninii is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest for conservation efforts."
