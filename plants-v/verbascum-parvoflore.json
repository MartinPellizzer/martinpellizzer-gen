    "intro": "Verbascum parvoflore, commonly known as the small-flowered mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum parvoflore is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat respiratory ailments."
