    "intro": "Verbascum wiedemannianum, commonly known as the Persian mullein, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
