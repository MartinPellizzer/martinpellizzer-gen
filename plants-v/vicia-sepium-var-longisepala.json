    "intro": "Vicia sepium var. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its distinctive elongated sepals. It is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that mature into a dry, dehiscent fruit. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
