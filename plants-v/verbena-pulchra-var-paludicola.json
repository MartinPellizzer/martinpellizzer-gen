    "intro": "Verbena pulchra var. paludicola, commonly known as the marsh verbena, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of wetlands. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
