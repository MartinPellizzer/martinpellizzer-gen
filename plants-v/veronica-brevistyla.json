It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which are usually hairy and have a dark green hue. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued plant in horticulture."
