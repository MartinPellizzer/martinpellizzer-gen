    "intro": "Valeriana parnassiifolia, commonly known as the Parnassian valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in umbel-like inflorescences. Its roots are often harvested for their aromatic compounds, which have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. Valeriana parnassiifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments."
