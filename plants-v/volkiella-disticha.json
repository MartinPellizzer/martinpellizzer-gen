    "intro": "Volkiella disticha, commonly known as the two-branched bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually paired and opposite, with the lower pair often forming the bladders. Volkiella disticha is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival."
