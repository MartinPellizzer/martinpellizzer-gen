    "intro": "Vriesea billbergiae, commonly known as the pink vriesea, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that surround its spathiflorous inflorescence, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
