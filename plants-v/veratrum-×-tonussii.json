    "intro": "Veratrum \u00d7 tonussii, commonly known as the hybrid white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Melanthiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts contain harmful alkaloids."
