    "intro": "Vincetoxicum woollsii, commonly known as Woolly Bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its attractive, finely toothed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces orange-red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds. Vincetoxicum woollsii is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants with seasonal interest."
