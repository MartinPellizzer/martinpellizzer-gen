    "intro": "Vriesea friburgensis var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the wetlands and lowland areas of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of trichomes, which help retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its inflorescence features vibrant, showy bracts that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. This variety is adapted to swampy environments, making it a unique and resilient member of the bromeliad family."
