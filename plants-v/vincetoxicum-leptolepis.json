    "intro": "Vincetoxicum leptolepis, commonly known as the slender false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically opposite on the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in gardens. Vincetoxicum leptolepis is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
