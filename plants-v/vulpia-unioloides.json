    "intro": "Vulpia unioloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved veldt grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Vulpia unioloides is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy component of many native plant communities."
