    "intro": "Veronicastrum sibiricum f. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous blueweed, is a cultivar of the blue mistflower. It is a herbaceous perennial that features tall, upright stems covered with spikes of pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant is native to eastern Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy, though the 'glabratum' form has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscapes for its striking floral display."
