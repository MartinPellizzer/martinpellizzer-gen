    "intro": "Vaccinium longisepalum, commonly known as the long-sepal blueberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in acidic, sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which later develop into edible berries. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and the plant is often found in wetlands or along the edges of swamps. Vaccinium longisepalum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
