    "intro": "Vanilla coursii, commonly known as the desert vanilla, is a climbing vine native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit, a small, greenish pod, contains seeds and is often used in traditional medicine. Despite its name, Vanilla coursii is not a true vanilla orchid and does not produce the aromatic vanilla extract used in cooking."
