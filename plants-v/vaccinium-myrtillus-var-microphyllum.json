    "intro": "Vaccinium myrtillus var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved bilberry, is a variant of the bilberry plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, dark blue berries and elliptical leaves. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. It plays an important role in ecosystems as a food source for wildlife and has been used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it distinct from the typical bilberry, with reduced leaf size and a more compact growth habit."
