    "intro": "Vernonia teres, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, rough hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia teres is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
