    "intro": "Vilfa parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered vilfa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Vilfa parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
