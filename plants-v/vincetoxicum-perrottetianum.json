    "intro": "Vincetoxicum perrottetianum, commonly known as the red bunting or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Vincetoxicum perrottetianum is valued for its ornamental appeal but can be considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and spread."
