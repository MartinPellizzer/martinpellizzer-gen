    "intro": "Vriesea zildae, commonly known as the Zildae's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, often including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea zildae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
