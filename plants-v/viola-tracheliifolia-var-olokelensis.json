It is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It has small, hairy stems and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
