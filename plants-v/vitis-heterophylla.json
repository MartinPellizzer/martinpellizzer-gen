    "intro": "Vitis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable grapevine, is a species of vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either lobed or entire depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to edible berries, which are typically black or purple in color. Its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Vitis heterophylla is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
