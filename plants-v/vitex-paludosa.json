    "intro": "Vitex paludosa, commonly known as swamp vitex, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Vitex paludosa is adapted to moist, poorly drained soils and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
