    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus subsp. litigiosum, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent yellow centers, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This subspecies is noted for its adaptability and resilience in dry, sunny conditions."
