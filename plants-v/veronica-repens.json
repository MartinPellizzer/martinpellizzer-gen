    "intro": "Veronica repens, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. The plant has wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
