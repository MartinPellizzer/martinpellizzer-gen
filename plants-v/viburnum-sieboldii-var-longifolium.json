It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest."
