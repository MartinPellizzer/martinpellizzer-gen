    "intro": "Viguiera hassleriana, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, lavender to pinkish-purple flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled spheres that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Viguiera hassleriana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. Its ecological value includes providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
