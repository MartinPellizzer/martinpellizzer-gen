    "intro": "Verbascum decorum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Verbascum decorum is often used in herbal medicine for its potential respiratory benefits."
