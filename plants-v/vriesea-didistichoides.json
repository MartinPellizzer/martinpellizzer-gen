    "intro": "Vriesea didistichoides, commonly known as the \"Coral Bells\" or \"Red Vriesea,\" is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-colored bracts that surround the central inflorescence, which typically produces white or pink flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often adorned with red or purple markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea didistichoides is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
