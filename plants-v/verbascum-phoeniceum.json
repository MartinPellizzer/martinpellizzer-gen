    "intro": "Verbascum phoeniceum, commonly known as the redleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Its leaves are large, broad, and often tinged with reddish or purple hues, contributing to its striking appearance. Verbascum phoeniceum is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
