    "intro": "Vicia hirta, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Vicia hirta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
