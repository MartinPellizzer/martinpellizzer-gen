    "intro": "Vanieria triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant is often found in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or other substrates. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant within its habitat. The fronds are usually dark green and have a soft, velvety texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in aquatic ecosystems."
