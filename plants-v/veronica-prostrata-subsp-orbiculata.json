    "intro": "Veronica prostrata subsp. orbiculata, commonly known as the prostrate speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are oval to\u5706\u5f62, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded conditions. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
