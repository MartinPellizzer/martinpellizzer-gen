    "intro": "Vicia costae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, pinnately compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia costae is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
