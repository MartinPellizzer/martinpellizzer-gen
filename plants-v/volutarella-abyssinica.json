    "intro": "Volutarella abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian violet, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark purple foliage and clusters of delicate, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires protection."
