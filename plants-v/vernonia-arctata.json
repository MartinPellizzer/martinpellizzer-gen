    "intro": "Vernonia arctata, commonly known as the Arctic vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are often grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
