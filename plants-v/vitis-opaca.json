    "intro": "Vitis opaca, commonly known as the sand grape, is a woody vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to clusters of grape-like berries. These berries are typically dark blue to black in color and are edible, though not as widely cultivated as other grape species. Vitis opaca is often found in sandy or rocky soils along stream banks and woodland edges."
