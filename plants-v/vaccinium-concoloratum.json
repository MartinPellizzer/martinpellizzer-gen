    "intro": "Vaccinium concoloratum, commonly known as the smooth blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its fruit is a blue-black berry that ripens in the summer and is edible for both humans and wildlife. The leaves are elliptical, dark green, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its evergreen nature."
