    "intro": "Vaccinium penduliflorum var. berberidifolium, commonly known as the red-mountain blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or bronze underside. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a food source for wildlife."
