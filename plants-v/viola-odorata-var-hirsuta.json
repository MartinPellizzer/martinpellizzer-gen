    "intro": "Viola odorata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its \"hirsuta\" designation, which means \"hairy\" in Latin. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its fragrance and ornamental value make it a valued addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
