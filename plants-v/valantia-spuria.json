    "intro": "Valantia spuria, commonly known as the slender valantia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Valantia spuria is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in its native habitat."
