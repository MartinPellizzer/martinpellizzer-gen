    "intro": "Vanda tricolor subsp. suavis, commonly known as the sweet-scented vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a sweet fragrance. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Vanda tricolor subsp. suavis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
