    "intro": "Vantanea depleta, commonly known as the dwindling beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, violet-pink petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is classified as critically endangered. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species."
