    "intro": "Vitis curtisii, commonly known as Curtis's grape, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody vine with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
