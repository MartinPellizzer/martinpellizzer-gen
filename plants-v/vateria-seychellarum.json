    "intro": "Vateria seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles vateria, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which is primarily associated with tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen nature and possesses a distinctive, woody structure with thick, leathery leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the island's native forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
