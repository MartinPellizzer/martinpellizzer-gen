    "intro": "Vernonia platyseta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom from late summer into early fall. Vernonia platyseta is often found in dry, sandy soils in open woodlands and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
