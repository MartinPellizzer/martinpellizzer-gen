    "intro": "Viola subviscosa, commonly known as the sticky violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves covered in a sticky, glandular coating. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. Viola subviscosa prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sticky leaves and early blooming habit make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
