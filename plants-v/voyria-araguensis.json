It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
