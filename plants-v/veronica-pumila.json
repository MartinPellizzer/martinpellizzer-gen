    "intro": "Veronica pumila, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, mat-forming leaves that help it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and restoration projects."
