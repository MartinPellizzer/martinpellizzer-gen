    "intro": "Viburnum farinosum, commonly known as the hairyleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum farinosum thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
