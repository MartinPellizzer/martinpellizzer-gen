    "intro": "Viola amiatina, commonly known as the Amiatina violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the volcanic regions of Italy. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices and forested areas. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, which makes it a challenging species to observe in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola amiatina is considered a vulnerable species."
