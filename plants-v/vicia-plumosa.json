    "intro": "Vicia plumosa, commonly known as the silky vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia plumosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
