    "intro": "Veronica arenaria, commonly known as sand veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, gravelly slopes, and rocky habitats. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a hardy and resilient species in its native range."
