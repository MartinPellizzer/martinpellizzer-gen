    "intro": "Vernonia angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds and is often found in disturbed soils. Vernonia angustissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
