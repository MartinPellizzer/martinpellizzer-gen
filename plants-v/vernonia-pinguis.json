It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy purple to pink flower heads in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streambanks. Its botanical structure supports its role as a valuable nectar source for pollinators."
