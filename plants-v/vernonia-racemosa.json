    "intro": "Vernonia racemosa, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to six feet. Vernonia racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
