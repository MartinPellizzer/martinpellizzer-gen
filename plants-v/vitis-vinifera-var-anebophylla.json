    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. anebophylla, commonly known as the Anebophylla grape, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the European grapevine. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed leaves with a distinct, almost fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and requires a specific set of environmental conditions to thrive. Its berries are smaller than those of standard Vitis vinifera varieties and are often used in specialized winemaking or as ornamental plants. Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
