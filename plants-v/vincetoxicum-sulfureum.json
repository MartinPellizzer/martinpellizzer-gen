    "intro": "Vincetoxicum sulfureum, commonly known as the golden smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, feathery panicles that turn a brilliant yellow-orange in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth texture. Vincetoxicum sulfureum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
