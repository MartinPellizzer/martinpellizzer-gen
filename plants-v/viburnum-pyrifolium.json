    "intro": "Viburnum pyrifolium, commonly known as the mapleleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that resemble maple leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum pyrifolium typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. It is valued in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
