    "intro": "Viscaria coeli-rosa var. splendida, commonly known as the Splendour Star-of-Bethlehem, is a striking member of the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which can last from late spring through early summer."
