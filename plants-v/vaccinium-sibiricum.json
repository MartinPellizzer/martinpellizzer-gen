    "intro": "Vaccinium sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or dark purple in color, rich in antioxidants and nutrients. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and tundra regions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture and remain green throughout the year. Vaccinium sibiricum plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
