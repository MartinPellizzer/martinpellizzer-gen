    "intro": "Viola pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-leaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive spur at the back of the flower. Viola pachyrrhiza is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and ability to attract pollinators."
