    "intro": "Vriesea recurvata, commonly known as the zigzag bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that curve in a zigzag pattern, creating an elegant, architectural appearance. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a torch. Vriesea recurvata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
