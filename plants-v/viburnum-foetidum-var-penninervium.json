    "intro": "Viburnum foetidum var. penninervium, commonly known as the sweet viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green above and lighter below, with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, floral display, and seasonal fruiting. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
