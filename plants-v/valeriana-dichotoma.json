    "intro": "Valeriana dichotoma, commonly known as the forked valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its roots contain volatile oils and are used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana dichotoma thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments."
