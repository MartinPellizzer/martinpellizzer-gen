It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, similar to other species in the Vacciniaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and remain green throughout the year, providing ornamental value in gardens. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential for cultivation in suitable environments."
