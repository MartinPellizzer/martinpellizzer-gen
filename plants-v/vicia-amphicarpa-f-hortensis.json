    "intro": "Vicia amphicarpa f. hortensis, commonly known as the garden vetch, is a cultivated form of the vetch plant. It is a leguminous species characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive two-seeded pod, which is a defining feature of the species. This variety is often grown as a ornamental plant or for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
