    "intro": "Veratrum maximowiczii var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine white hellebore, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of white to pale green flowers. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and its roots are thick and fleshy. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
