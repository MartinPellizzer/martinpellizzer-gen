    "intro": "Vatairea macrocarpa, commonly known as the sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive star-shaped leaves with five pointed lobes. The tree produces showy, spherical clusters of flowers that are surrounded by bracts, which turn from green to red as they mature. Its fruit is a spiky, five-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
