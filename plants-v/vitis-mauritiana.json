Native to the island of Mauritius, it is a climbing vine characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered berries. The plant produces both male and female flowers, with the female flowers developing into edible fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and on limestone substrates.
