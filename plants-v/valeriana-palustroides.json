    "intro": "Valeriana palustroides, commonly known as swamp valerian, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slight hairy texture. Valeriana palustroides is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
