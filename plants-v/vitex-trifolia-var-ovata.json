    "intro": "Vitex trifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate-leaf chaste tree, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and dark green on top. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
