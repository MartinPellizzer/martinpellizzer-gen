    "intro": "Viscum bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various birds and mammals. Viscum bakeri is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host."
