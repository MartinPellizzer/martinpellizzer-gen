    "intro": "Varasia aristata, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a subtle fragrance and are pollinated primarily by insects. Varasia aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its delicate appearance."
