    "intro": "Vitis cinerea var. cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pale green to silver-colored leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, black berries in the fall. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found along stream banks and in moist soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
