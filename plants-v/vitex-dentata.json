    "intro": "Vitex dentata, commonly known as the American vitex or horse brush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically clustered in panicles, displaying shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vitex dentata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. It has a distinctive aromatic scent and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
