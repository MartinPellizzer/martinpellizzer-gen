    "intro": "Viscum verruculosum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apple trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem, which is embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and often have a distinctive waxy coating. Viscum verruculosum plays an important role in forest ecosystems, supporting a variety of insect and bird life."
