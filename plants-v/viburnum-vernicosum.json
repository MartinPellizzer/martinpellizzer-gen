    "intro": "Viburnum vernicosum, commonly known as the white-fruited viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green above and lighter below. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by showy, white, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. Viburnum vernicosum is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, flowers, and persistent fruits, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
