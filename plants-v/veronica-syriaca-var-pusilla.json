    "intro": "Veronica syriaca var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
