    "intro": "Vicia atropurpurea proles perennis, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with purple-tinged veins and produces small, pea-like flowers that range from purple to pink. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
