    "intro": "Vellozia intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vellozia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear small, bright yellow flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Vellozia intermedia is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can endure prolonged periods of drought. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
