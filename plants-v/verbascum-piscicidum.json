    "intro": "Verbascum piscicidum, commonly known as the fishkill mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy leaves that are covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its name, it has a historical association with the death of fish in waterways, likely due to its presence in riparian areas."
