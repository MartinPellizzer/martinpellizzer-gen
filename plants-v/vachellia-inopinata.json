    "intro": "Vachellia inopinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are narrow and feathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact inflorescences, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Vachellia inopinata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
