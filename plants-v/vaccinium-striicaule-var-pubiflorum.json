    "intro": "Vaccinium striicaule var. pubiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-flowered blueberry, is a variant of the Vaccinium genus native to certain regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to white in color, which bloom in early summer. Its fruits are small, tart berries that ripen to a dark blue or purple hue, making it a potential candidate for local cultivation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in native plant restoration projects."
