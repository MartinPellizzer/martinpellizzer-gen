    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 ramigerum subsp. heterophlomos, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a dense spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used in traditional herbal medicine."
