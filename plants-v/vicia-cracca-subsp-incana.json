    "intro": "Vicia cracca subsp. incana, commonly known as the hoary vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
