    "intro": "Ventia crocea subsp. insula, commonly known as the island ventia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily on certain tropical islands. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the dry season, followed by small, elongated fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
