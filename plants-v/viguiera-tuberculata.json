    "intro": "Viguiera tuberculata, commonly known as the Mexican heath, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrub and grassland habitats. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces a distinctive, tuberculate stem. Viguiera tuberculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
