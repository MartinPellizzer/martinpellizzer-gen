    "intro": "Vaccinium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. The berries, which are typically blue or purple when mature, are edible and have a tart flavor. Vaccinium obovatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
