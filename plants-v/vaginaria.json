    "intro": "Vaginaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to sandy or saline soils. Vaginaria species are characterized by their distinctive, often tubular or spathaceous flowers, which are usually blue or purple in color. The leaves are usually narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
