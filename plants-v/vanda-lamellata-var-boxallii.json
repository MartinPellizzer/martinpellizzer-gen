    "intro": "Vanda lamellata var. boxallii, commonly known as the Boxall's Vanda, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears clusters of vibrant, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
