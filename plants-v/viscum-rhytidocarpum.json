    "intro": "Viscum rhytidocarpum, commonly known as the rough-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces white, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Viscum rhytidocarpum is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in a variety of forest environments. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host."
