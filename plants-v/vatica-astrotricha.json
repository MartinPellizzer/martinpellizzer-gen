It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, aromatic bark. The leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface and a distinctive star-shaped venation pattern. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. This species is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems."
