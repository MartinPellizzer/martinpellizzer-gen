    "intro": "Viburnum premnaceum, commonly known as the swamp viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and riparian areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the spring, followed by dark red to black berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Viburnum premnaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
