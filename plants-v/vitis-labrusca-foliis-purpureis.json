    "intro": "Vitis labrusca foliis-purpureis, commonly known as the purpleleaf muscadine grape, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, thick-skinned berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. The leaves are distinctly purple or bronze in color, especially during the growing season, which makes it visually striking. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in woodland edges or along fence rows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also cultivated for its flavorful, seedless fruits."
