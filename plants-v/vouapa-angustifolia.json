    "intro": "Vouapa angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vouapa, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
