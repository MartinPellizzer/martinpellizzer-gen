    "intro": "Viburnum cuneifolium, commonly known as arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green above and lighter beneath. The plant produces flat, clustered inflorescences of white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value. Viburnum cuneifolium is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
