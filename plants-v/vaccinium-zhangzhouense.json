    "intro": "Vaccinium zhangzhouense, commonly known as Zhangzhou blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
