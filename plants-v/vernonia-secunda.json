    "intro": "Vernonia secunda, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are silver-gray in color, which helps reflect excess sunlight and reduce water loss. Vernonia secunda produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
