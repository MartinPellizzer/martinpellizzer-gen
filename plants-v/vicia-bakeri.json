    "intro": "Vicia bakeri, commonly known as Baker's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vicia bakeri is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in certain ecosystems."
