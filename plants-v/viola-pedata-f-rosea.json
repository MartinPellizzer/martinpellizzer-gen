    "intro": "Viola pedata f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered violet, is a compact perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green hue and is characterized by its showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and striking floral display. Viola pedata f. rosea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
