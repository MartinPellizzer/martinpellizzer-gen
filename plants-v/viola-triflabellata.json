It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from purple to white. Native to specific regions in South America, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
