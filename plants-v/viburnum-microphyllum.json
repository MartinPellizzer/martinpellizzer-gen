    "intro": "Viburnum microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf smilacina, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum microphyllum thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is often found in forest understories. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plant species."
