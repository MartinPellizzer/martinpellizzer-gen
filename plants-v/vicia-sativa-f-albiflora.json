    "intro": "Vicia sativa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered vetch, is a botanical variant of the common vetch. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical green-flowered form. This plant is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The foliage is trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaves, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds."
