    "intro": "Vaccinium myrsinites var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are edible for humans and wildlife, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in xeriscaped gardens."
