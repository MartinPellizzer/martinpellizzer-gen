    "intro": "Vitis cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, sweet, edible berries. The plant has a woody stem with tendrils that allow it to climb and spread along trellises or other structures. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five leaflets and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Vitis cordifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
