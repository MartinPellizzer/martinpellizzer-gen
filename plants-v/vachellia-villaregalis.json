    "intro": "Vachellia villaregalis, commonly known as the golden acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Vachellia villaregalis is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
