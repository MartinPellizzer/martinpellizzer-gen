It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is also considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
