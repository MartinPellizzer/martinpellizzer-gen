    "intro": "Vriesea plurifolia, commonly known as the rainbow plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which can range from red to orange, yellow, and pink. The plant features a central rosette of grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. Its flowering stem produces multiple flower spikes, each bearing small white or pale green flowers. Vriesea plurifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
