It is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats, particularly on serpentine soils. This plant has small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic conditions typical of serpentine substrates. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient member of alpine flora."
