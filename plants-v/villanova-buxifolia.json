    "intro": "Villanova buxifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf boxwood, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is often used in formal garden designs."
