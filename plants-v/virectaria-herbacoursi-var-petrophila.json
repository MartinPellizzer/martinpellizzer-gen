    "intro": "Virectaria herbacoursi var. petrophila, commonly known as the rock-hugging virectaria, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor soils. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, densely packed leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces delicate, pale green flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the stems. It is typically found in mountainous regions with high elevations and limited soil coverage. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
