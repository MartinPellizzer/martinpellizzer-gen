    "intro": "Veronica drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It has a low, spreading growth habit with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
