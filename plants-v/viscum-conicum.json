    "intro": "Viscum conicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum conicum is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic nature, with reduced roots and chlorophyll content compared to free-living plants."
