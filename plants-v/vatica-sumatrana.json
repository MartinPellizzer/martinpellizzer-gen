    "intro": "Vatica sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the forests of Sumatra and Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, heavy timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in spikes. Vatica sumatrana is also notable for its long, straight trunk and its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Due to its ecological importance and the demand for its wood, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
