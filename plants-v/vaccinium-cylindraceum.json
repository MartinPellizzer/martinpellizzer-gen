    "intro": "Vaccinium cylindraceum, commonly known as the cylindrical blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It produces small, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and heathland environments. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often form dense mats. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local fauna and its resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
