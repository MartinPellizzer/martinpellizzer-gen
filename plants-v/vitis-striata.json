    "intro": "Vitis striata, commonly known as the streaked grapevine, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often striped stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet berries that ripen in the fall. Vitis striata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
