    "intro": "Verbascum glomerulosum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered in dense, soft white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
