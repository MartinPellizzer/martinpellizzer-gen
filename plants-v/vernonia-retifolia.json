    "intro": "Vernonia retifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, sandy soils. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces clusters of small, yellow to brown flowers. Vernonia retifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
