    "intro": "Virola excisa, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Virola excisa is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in many regions."
