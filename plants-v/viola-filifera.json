    "intro": "Viola filifera, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a hairy texture, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or blue. Viola filifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscaping."
