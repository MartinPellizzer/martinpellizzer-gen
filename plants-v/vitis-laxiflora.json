    "intro": "Vitis laxiflora, commonly known as the loose-flowered grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fruits are small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Vitis laxiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and seasonal interest."
