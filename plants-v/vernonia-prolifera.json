    "intro": "Vernonia prolifera, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture. Vernonia prolifera is valued for its hardiness and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
