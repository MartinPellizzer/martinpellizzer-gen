    "intro": "Vriesea neoglutinosa, commonly known as the Orange Sword, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant orange flowers and sword-shaped, dark green leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces inflorescences that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it a dramatic addition to any collection. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea neoglutinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
