It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The plant is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
