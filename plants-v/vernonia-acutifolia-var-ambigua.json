It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typical of the sunflower family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
