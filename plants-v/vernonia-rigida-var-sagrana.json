    "intro": "Vernonia rigida var. sagrana, commonly known as the rigid ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
