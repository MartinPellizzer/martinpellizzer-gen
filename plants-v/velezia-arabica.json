    "intro": "Velezia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Arabian Peninsula. It produces small, dark green leaves and red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well-adapted to its native environment. Its fruit, which resembles a cherry, contains the seeds used to make coffee. Velezia arabica is considered a rare and valuable species due to its limited geographic distribution and historical significance in coffee cultivation."
