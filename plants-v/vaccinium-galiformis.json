    "intro": "Vaccinium galiformis, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to acidic, nutrient-poor soils in northern regions. It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue or black in color. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in heathlands and peat bogs. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
