The plant produces clusters of small, purple to pinkish-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
