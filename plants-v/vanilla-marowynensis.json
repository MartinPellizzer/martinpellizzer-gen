    "intro": "Vanilla marowynensis, commonly known as the Marowyn vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, dark brown pods, which are the source of its characteristic vanilla aroma. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its vanilla pods are harvested when they are fully mature and dried to develop their rich flavor profile. This species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its use in the culinary and fragrance industries."
