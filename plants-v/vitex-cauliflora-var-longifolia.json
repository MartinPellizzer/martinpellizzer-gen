    "intro": "Vitex cauliflora var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf vitex, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale purple, which are typically arranged in terminal or axillary inflorescences. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
