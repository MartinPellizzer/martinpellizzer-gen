    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, broad leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a strong, often disagreeable odor due to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its sedative and calming effects."
