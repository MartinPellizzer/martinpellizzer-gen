    "intro": "Valerianella puberula, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Valerianella puberula is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, in gardens, and in meadows. It is a hardy species that thrives in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
