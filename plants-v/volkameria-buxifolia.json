    "intro": "Volkameria buxifolia, commonly known as the box-leaf volkameria, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant. Volkameria buxifolia is relatively low maintenance, thriving in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
