    "intro": "Viscago fusca, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Viscago fusca plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
