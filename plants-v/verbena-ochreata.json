    "intro": "Verbena ochreata, commonly known as the yellow verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Verbena ochreata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
