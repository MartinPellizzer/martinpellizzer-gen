    "intro": "Vochysia aurea, commonly known as golden vochysia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Vochysia aurea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
