    "intro": "Viola fruticosa, commonly known as the creeping wood violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Viola fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
