    "intro": "Vachellia pseudofistula, commonly known as the African burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its yellow flowers that bloom in cylindrical inflorescences. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species often found in savannas and rocky areas. Vachellia pseudofistula is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of forage for wildlife."
