    "intro": "Vulpia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is usually erect and hair-like, giving it its common name. Vulpia flavescens is characterized by its small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
