    "intro": "Valeriana saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola valerian, is a flowering plant native to rocky and mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky substrates, and it produces fragrant, tubular flowers that attract various pollinators. Valeriana saxicola is also valued for its medicinal properties, historically used for its calming effects."
