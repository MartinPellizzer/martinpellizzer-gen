    "intro": "Vaccinium carneolum, commonly known as the red evergreen huckleberry, is a species of shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and rhododendrons. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bright red berries that are edible. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications, though they are more commonly foraged than cultivated. Vaccinium carneolum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
