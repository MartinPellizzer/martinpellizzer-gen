    "intro": "Viola pubinervis, commonly known as the pubescent violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a fuzzy, pubescent surface. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically in early spring. Its flowers have a distinctive downward-curving spur that stores nectar, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Viola pubinervis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks."
