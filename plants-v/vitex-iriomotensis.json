    "intro": "Vitex iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote vitex, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It is a small shrub that belongs to the verbena family, Verbenaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Vitex iriomotensis is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
