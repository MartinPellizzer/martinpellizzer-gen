    "intro": "Vicia bracteata, commonly known as the bracted vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are trifoliate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are borne on elongated peduncles. Its pods are slender, cylindrical, and contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Vicia bracteata is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia."
