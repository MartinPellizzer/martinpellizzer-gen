    "intro": "Viola pseudoprionantha, commonly known as the giant violet, is a striking member of the Violaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant is notable for its large, showy flowers that range in color from violet to blue, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Viola pseudoprionantha thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters."
