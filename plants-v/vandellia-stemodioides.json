    "intro": "Vandellia stemodioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its pale, translucent leaves and its striking, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its leaf-like structures for nutrient absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species."
