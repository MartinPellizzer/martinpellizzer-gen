    "intro": "Vriesea bleheri f. atroviolaceifolia, commonly known as the Black-veined Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green with prominent, almost black veins. The plant produces vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescences with bright orange petals and red bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
