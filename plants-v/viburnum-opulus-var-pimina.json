    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. pimina, commonly known as the white-fruited guelder rose, is a deciduous shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound, opposite leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in late summer. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it often has a tendency to sucker, forming dense thickets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest."
