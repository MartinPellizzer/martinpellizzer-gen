    "intro": "Vriesea reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height, featuring bright red bracts. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage composed of broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea reitzii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
