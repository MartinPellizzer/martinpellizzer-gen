    "intro": "Vicia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese vetch, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a legume characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or blue in color. Vicia japonica is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
