    "intro": "Vanda cristata, commonly known as the crested vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, crinkled leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers, which can be white, pink, or yellow, bloom in summer and are often used in floral arrangements. Vanda cristata is prized for its ornamental value and requires bright light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
