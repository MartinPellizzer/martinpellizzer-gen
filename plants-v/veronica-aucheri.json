    "intro": "Veronica aucheri, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial that features dense, mat-forming foliage. Its leaves are typically silver-gray in color, with a fuzzy texture that helps reflect sunlight and retain moisture. The plant produces spikes of blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Veronica aucheri is native to Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
