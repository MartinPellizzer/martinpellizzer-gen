    "intro": "Viola kamtschadalorum var. pubescens, commonly known as the Kamtschadala violet, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and northern Japan. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
