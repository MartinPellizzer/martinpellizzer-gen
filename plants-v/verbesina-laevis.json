    "intro": "Verbesina laevis, commonly known as the smooth beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and hairy leaves that are often mistaken for the similar-looking common beggar-ticks. The plant produces yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Verbesina laevis is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
