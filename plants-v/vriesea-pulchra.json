    "intro": "Vriesea pulchra, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Vriesea,\" is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which can range from red, orange, and yellow to pink and purple. The plant features a central rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Vriesea pulchra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
