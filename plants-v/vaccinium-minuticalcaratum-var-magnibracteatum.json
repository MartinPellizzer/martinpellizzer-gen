    "intro": "Vaccinium minuticalcaratum var. magnibracteatum, commonly known as the large-bracted huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits are typically red or black berries, which are edible and often used in local culinary traditions. This variety is distinguished by its larger bracts compared to the typical form of Vaccinium minuticalcaratum."
