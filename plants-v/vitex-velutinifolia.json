    "intro": "Vitex velutinifolia, commonly known as velvetleaf vitex, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Vitex velutinifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
