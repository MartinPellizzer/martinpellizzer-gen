    "intro": "Vicia sepium var. montana, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports, and trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in loose clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in soil enrichment and habitat restoration."
