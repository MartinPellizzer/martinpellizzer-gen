    "intro": "Vriesea corallina, commonly known as the coral vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-like red bracts that surround its flowering spikes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Vriesea corallina thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
