    "intro": "Vriesea longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepal vriesea, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous bracts that display a range of colors, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Its inflorescence consists of multiple flowers that bloom sequentially, adding to its ornamental value. Vriesea longisepala thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
