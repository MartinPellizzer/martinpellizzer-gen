    "intro": "Viburnum ashei, commonly known as the Florida huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries in the fall. Viburnum ashei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and swampy areas."
