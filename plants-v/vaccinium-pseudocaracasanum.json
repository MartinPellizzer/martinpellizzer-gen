It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and heathers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowers are bell-shaped, pinkish-white in color, and appear in clusters during the spring. The plant's berries are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Vaccinium species."
