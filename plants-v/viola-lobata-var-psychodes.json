    "intro": "Viola lobata var. psychodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique and rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that resemble orchids, despite not being a true orchid. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
