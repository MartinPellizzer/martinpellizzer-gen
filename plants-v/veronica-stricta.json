The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Veronica stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural and garden settings."
