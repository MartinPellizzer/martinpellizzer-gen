    "intro": "Vernonia profusa, commonly known as the common ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow to orange disc flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a valuable component of native plant communities."
