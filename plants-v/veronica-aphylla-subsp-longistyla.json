It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated stigmas, which are more pronounced than in the typical form. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant's botanical features make it a notable component of native plant communities in its range."
