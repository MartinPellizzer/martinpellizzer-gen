    "intro": "Ventilago dichotoma, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows along coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its seed pods split open to release tiny seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Ventilago dichotoma is adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in traditional medicine."
