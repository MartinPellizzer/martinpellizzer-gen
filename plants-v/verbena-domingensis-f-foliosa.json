    "intro": "Verbena domingensis f. foliosa, commonly known as the silver verbena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely arranged along its stems, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom throughout the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and Mediterranean climates."
