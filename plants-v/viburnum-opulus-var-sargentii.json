It is characterized by its distinctive, showy white bracts that appear in late spring, often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn vibrant red in the fall. Viburnum opulus var. sargentii thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
