    "intro": "Vochysia caroliae-scottii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant features compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its rarity and the demand for its wood, it is considered an endangered species."
