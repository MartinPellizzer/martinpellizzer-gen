    "intro": "Vernonia rigida, commonly known as rigid ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are often gray-green in color, and its stems are rigid and somewhat woody. Vernonia rigida is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. It serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
