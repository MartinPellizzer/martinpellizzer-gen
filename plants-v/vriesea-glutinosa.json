    "intro": "Vriesea glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange and yellow. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are covered in a sticky substance that helps in trapping moisture and small insects. Vriesea glutinosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
