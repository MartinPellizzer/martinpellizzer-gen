    "intro": "Vernonia serrulata, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Vernonia serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
