The plant is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like leaf margins, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows and woodland areas. Valerianella rimosa var. auricula is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in culinary and medicinal applications."
