    "intro": "Vanilla kempteriana, commonly known as the Kempter's vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the production of fragrant, elongated pods that resemble those of the more well-known vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typical of the Amazonian rainforests. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a subtle fragrance, and the pods develop after a period of pollination by specific bee species. The vanilla flavor of the pods is less intense compared to commercial vanilla, but it is still valued in some traditional culinary and medicinal uses."
