    "intro": "Viola nemorum, commonly known as the wood violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple and white. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. Viola nemorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in forest ecosystems."
