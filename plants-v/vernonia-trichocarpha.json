    "intro": "Vernonia trichocarpha, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia trichocarpha is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
