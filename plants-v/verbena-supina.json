    "intro": "Verbena supina, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink, typically blooming from summer to fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Verbena supina is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
