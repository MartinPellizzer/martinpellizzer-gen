    "intro": "Verbena oblaetia, commonly known as the narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbena oblaetia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
