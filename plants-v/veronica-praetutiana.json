    "intro": "Veronica praetutiana, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Veronica praetutiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
