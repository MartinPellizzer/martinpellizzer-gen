    "intro": "Vernonia inaequiserrata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
