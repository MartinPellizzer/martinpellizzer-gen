    "intro": "Viscum obtusatum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this purpose. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red, contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees, facilitating propagation. Viscum obtusatum is widely distributed across Europe and has cultural significance in many regions."
