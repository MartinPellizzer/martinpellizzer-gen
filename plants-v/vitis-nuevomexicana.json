It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clustered berries, which are typically dark blue to black when mature. Vitis nuevomexicana thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along rocky slopes and in dry woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use in drought-resistant crops."
