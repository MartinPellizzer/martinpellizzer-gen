    "intro": "Vernonanthura puberula, commonly known as the silky vernonberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its \"puberula\" designation. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
