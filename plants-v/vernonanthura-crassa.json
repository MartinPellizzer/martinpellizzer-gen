It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
