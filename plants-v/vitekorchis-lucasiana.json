    "intro": "Vitekorchis lucasiana, commonly known as the Lucas's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Vitekorchis lucasiana is a rare and delicate species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
