It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with wetland or marshy habitats. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, characteristic of the sedge family. Vieusseuxia mutila plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
