    "intro": "Vitis martini, commonly known as the grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its climbing vines and clusters of small, sweet berries. The plant produces both male and female flowers, with the female flowers developing into the edible grapes. Vitis martini is often cultivated for its fruit, which is used in winemaking and as a food source. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a distinctive aroma."
