    "intro": "Viguiera linearis f. latiorifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a variant of the ironweed genus native to the United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are wider than the typical form of Viguiera linearis. The plant produces upright clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
