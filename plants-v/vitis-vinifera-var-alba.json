    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. alba, commonly known as the white grapevine, is a variety of the common grapevine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its white berries and is primarily cultivated for winemaking, though it is less common than its red-fleshed relatives. The plant produces clusters of small, oval-shaped grapes that are typically used in dessert wines. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The varietal is also valued for its aromatic profile, contributing unique flavors to white wines."
