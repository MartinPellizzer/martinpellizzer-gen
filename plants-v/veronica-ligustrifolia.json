It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, blue or violet, and arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems.
