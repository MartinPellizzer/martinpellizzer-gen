It is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and mangrove areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
