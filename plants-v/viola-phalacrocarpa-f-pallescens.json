    "intro": "Viola phalacrocarpa f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale viola, is a botanical variant of the common violet, characterized by its pale greenish-yellow foliage and smaller, less intensely colored flowers compared to the typical species. It is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and blooms with violet flowers that have a subtle fragrance. Its flowers typically open in spring and are visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The pale viola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
