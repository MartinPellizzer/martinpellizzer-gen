It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Varronia pedunculosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
