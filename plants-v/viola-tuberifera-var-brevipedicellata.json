    "intro": "Viola tuberifera var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stemmed tuber violet, is a rare and specialized variant of the viola genus. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and allow it to survive in harsh conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive spur. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
