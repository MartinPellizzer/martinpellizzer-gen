    "intro": "Veronica salicornioides, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems that resemble small coral structures, which help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, providing protection against salt spray and intense sunlight. Veronica salicornioides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
