    "intro": "Vriesea princeps, commonly known as the Flame Sword, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and orange. The plant produces an inflorescence that consists of a central spike bearing numerous small, colorful flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea princeps is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
