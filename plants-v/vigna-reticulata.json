    "intro": "Vigna reticulata, commonly known as the horsegram or cluster bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a reticulate pattern. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several edible seeds. These seeds are rich in protein and are used in various cuisines, particularly in South Asia. Vigna reticulata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important crop in sustainable agriculture."
