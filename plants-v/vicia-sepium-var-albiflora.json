    "intro": "Vicia sepium var. albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered bush vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and its distinctive white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Vicia sepium var. albiflora is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and its role in ecological restoration projects."
