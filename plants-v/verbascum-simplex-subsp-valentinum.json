It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in soft, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use in herbal medicine."
