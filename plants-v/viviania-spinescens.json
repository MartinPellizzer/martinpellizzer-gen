    "intro": "Viviania spinescens, commonly known as the spiny viviania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage that provides protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Viviania spinescens is often found in dry forests and savannas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
