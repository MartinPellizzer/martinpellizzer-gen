It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, curved pods that mature in late summer. Vicia durandii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
