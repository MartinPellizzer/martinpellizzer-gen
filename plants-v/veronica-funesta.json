    "intro": "Veronica funesta, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth, is a striking plant with distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue or violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by moths, particularly the death's-head hawkmoth. Its name reflects the dark, almost ominous appearance of its flower clusters, which resemble a skull."
