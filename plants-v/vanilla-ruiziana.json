    "intro": "Vanilla ruiziana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It produces fragrant, dark brown vanilla pods that are harvested and used in culinary and aromatic applications. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically yellow with purple markings, and it requires a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for proper development. Vanilla ruiziana is valued not only for its flavor but also for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance."
