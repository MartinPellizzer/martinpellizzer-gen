    "intro": "Vaccinium poianum, commonly known as the Poian blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
