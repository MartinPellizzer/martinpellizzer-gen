    "intro": "Vernonia plumosa, commonly known as the plume Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and fluffy, pale blue to white flower heads that resemble plumes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Vernonia plumosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
