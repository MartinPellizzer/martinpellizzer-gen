It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its showy, purple to pinkish-red composite flowers. Viguiera stenoloba has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular florets arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. It is valued in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
