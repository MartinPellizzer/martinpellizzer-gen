    "intro": "Vanilla sanguineovenosa, commonly known as the blood-red vanilla, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking reddish-brown flowers, which are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces fragrant, elongated pods that are similar in appearance to other vanilla species but are less commonly used for commercial vanilla extraction. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs that support its climbing growth pattern. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Vanilla sanguineovenosa is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
