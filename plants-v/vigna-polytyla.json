    "intro": "Vigna polytyla, commonly known as the small cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vigna polytyla is adapted to warm climates and is often grown as a forage crop or for its edible seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in agricultural systems where nitrogen fixation and soil enrichment are beneficial."
