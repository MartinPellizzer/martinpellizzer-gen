It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its root system fixes nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas."
