    "intro": "Vigna bourneae, commonly known as the cowpea or yardlong bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit, producing long, cylindrical pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein. Vigna bourneae also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
