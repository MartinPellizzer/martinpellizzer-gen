    "intro": "Verbascum drymophilum, commonly known as the mountain mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum drymophilum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
