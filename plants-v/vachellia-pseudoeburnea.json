    "intro": "Vachellia pseudoeburnea, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its long, drooping branches. The plant has compound leaves that are often reduced to small spines, with the remaining foliage being small and feathery. It produces yellow flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. The tree is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
