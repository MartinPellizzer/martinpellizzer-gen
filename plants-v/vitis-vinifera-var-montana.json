    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. montana, commonly known as the Montana grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and adaptability to a range of climates, though it prefers cooler conditions. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically used for winemaking rather than table consumption. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with tendrils that aid in climbing. This variety is of interest to horticulturists for its potential in cultivating hardy, resilient grapevines."
