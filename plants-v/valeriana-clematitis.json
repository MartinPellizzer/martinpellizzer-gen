    "intro": "Valeriana clematitis, commonly known as common valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils. Its rhizomes and roots are used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana clematitis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
