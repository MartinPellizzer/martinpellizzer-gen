    "intro": "Vilfa divaricata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf velvetleaf, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
