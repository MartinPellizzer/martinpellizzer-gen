    "intro": "Valeriana potopensis, commonly known as the Polish valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters. Valeriana potopensis is known for its strong, sometimes disagreeable aroma, which is attributed to its essential oils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
