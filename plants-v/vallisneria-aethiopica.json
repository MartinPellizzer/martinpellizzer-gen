It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically forms dense underwater stands, providing habitat and shelter for aquatic life. It reproduces through rhizomes, which allow it to spread rapidly in suitable conditions. Vallisneria aethiopica is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to oxygenate water."
