    "intro": "Vaccinium venustum, commonly known as the purple highbush blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that range in color from blue to purple. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Vaccinium venustum is often cultivated for both its ornamental appeal and its berries, which are used in culinary applications."
