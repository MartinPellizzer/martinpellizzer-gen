    "intro": "Valeriana arctica, commonly known as Arctic valerian, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. Valeriana arctica is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
