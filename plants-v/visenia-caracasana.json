    "intro": "Visenia caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
