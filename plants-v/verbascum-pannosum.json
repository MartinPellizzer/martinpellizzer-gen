    "intro": "Verbascum pannosum, commonly known as the fuzzy mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a dense layer of downy hairs, aiding in water retention. Verbascum pannosum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
