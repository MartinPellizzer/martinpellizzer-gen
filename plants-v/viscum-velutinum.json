    "intro": "Viscum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in a dense, velvety white down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Viscum velutinum is native to Europe and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems."
