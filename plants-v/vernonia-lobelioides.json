    "intro": "Vernonia lobelioides, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 2 feet tall, featuring narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces upright clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia lobelioides is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
