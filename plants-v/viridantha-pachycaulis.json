    "intro": "Viridantha pachycaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed green orchid, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking greenish-blue flowers with a velvety texture, often arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
