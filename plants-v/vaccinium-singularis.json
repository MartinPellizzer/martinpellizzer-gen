    "intro": "Vaccinium singularis, commonly known as the rare alpine blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe. It produces small, dark blue berries that are highly prized for their intense flavor and nutritional value. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vaccinium singularis is considered a rare and endangered species."
