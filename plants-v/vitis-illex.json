    "intro": "Vitis illex, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a climbing vine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into berries. The plant is often found growing along coastal areas and in rocky soils, showing a degree of salt tolerance. Its berries are edible but less commonly consumed compared to other grape species. Vitis illex is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
