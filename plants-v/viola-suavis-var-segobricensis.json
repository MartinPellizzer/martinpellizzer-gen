    "intro": "Viola suavis var. segobricensis, commonly known as the Segobric wild violet, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the sweet violet. It is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Balkans. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple and blue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species."
