    "intro": "Veronica oligosperma, commonly known as the lesser speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Veronica oligosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
