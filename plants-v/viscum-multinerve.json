    "intro": "Viscum multinerve, commonly known as the many-veined mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating its spread by adhering to birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a distinctive network of veins, giving it its scientific name. Viscum multinerve is often found in temperate regions and is an important part of the ecosystem, supporting bird life and contributing to forest biodiversity."
