    "intro": "Viola tenuis, commonly known as the slender violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often featuring a distinctive dark spot. Viola tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
