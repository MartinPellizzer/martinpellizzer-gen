    "intro": "Valerianella palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Valerianella palmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
