    "intro": "Veronica praecox var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and it produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and streamside habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for early pollinators."
