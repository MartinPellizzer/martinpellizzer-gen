    "intro": "Valeriana pusilla, commonly known as lesser valerian, is a small herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, featuring slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which contain volatile oils responsible for its distinctive scent. Valeriana pusilla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is valued in traditional medicine for its calming properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than its larger relatives."
