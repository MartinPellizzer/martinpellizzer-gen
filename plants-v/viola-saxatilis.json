    "intro": "Viola saxatilis, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often on cliffs or in alpine environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet-blue coloration, and its flowers are usually purple or violet, with five petals. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Viola saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and beauty."
