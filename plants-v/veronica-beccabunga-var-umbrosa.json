It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged opposite along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
