    "intro": "Vittaria modesta, commonly known as the small fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are usually divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Vittaria modesta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
