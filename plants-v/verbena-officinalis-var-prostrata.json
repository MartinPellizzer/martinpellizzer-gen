    "intro": "Verbena officinalis var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green hue. Creeping verbena is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
