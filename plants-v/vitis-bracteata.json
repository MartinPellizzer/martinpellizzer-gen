    "intro": "Vitis bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate grape or Chinese grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that ripen to a deep blue or black color. Vitis bracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden environments."
