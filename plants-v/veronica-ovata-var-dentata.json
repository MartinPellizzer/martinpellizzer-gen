    "intro": "Veronica ovata var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
