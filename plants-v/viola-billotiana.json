    "intro": "Viola billotiana, commonly known as the Billot's violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with five petals arranged symmetrically. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, which helps to retain moisture in its native habitat. Viola billotiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
