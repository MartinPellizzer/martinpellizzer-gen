    "intro": "Veronica cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's speedwell, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its native environment. Veronica cheesemanii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded conditions."
