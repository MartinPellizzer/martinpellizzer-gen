It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems. This subspecies is often found in grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
