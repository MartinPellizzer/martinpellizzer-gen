    "intro": "Viola riloensis, commonly known as the Riloensis violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to high-altitude landscapes.
