    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. campestris, commonly known as the creeping grape or wild grapevine, is a vigorous climbing vine native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant bears small, sour-tasting berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas."
