    "intro": "Vaccinium cardonae, commonly known as the desert blueberry, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers are usually white or pink and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vaccinium cardonae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in desert ecosystems."
