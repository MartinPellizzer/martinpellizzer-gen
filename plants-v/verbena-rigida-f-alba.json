    "intro": "Verbena rigida f. alba, commonly known as white vervain, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies add to its horticultural value."
