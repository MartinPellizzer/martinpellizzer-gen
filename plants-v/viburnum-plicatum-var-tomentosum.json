    "intro": "Viburnum plicatum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the Japanese snowball bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its uniquely pleated, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense, white tomentum, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered panicles of white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a versatile addition to landscapes."
