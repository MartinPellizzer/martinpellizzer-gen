    "intro": "Vicia costata subsp. venulosa, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The flowers are typically pale yellow to white, arranged in clusters, and are followed by elongated, slender pods. This subspecies is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
