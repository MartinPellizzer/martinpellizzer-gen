    "intro": "Viola semilunaris, commonly known as the moon viola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its flowers have a subtle fragrance and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Viola semilunaris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
