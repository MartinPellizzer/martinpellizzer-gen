    "intro": "Vincetoxicum bifidum, commonly known as twinleaf false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in follicles that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vincetoxicum bifidum is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
