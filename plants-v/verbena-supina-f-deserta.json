    "intro": "Verbena supina f. deserta, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
