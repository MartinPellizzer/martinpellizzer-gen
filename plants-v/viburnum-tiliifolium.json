    "intro": "Viburnum tiliifolium, commonly known as the sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy beneath, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that mature in the fall, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Viburnum tiliifolium is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
