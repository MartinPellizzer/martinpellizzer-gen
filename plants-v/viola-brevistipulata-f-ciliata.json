    "intro": "Viola brevistipulata f. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliate violet, is a flowering plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves with hairy margins, which give it the \"ciliata\" designation referring to the cilia or fine hairs. The flowers are typically purple or violet, with five petals and a distinctive lower lip that is often more prominent. This variety is native to parts of eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
