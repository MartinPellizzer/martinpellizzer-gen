    "intro": "Vernonia candolleana, commonly known as the candolleana ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant produces upright spikes of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Vernonia candolleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
