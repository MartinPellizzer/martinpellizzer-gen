    "intro": "Volvulus spithamineus, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
