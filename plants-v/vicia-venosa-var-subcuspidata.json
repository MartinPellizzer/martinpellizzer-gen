    "intro": "Vicia venosa var. subcuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets that have a slightly serrated edge, characteristic of the *Vicia* genus. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting soil fertility."
