    "intro": "Vaccinium puberulum var. spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and rhododendrons. The plant features oval to broadly ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. This variety is often found in moist, acidic soils in forest understories and is valued for both its ornamental and culinary uses."
