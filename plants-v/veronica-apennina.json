    "intro": "Veronica apennina, commonly known as the Italian speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps to reduce water loss.
