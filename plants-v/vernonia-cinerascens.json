It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are usually yellow or brownish-yellow, and the plant is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh climates."
