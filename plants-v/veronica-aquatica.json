    "intro": "Veronica aquatica, commonly known as water speedwell, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Veronica aquatica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
