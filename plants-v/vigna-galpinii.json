    "intro": "Vigna galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's bean, is a species of legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing several round, edible seeds. Vigna galpinii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water resources. Its botanical features make it an important plant for both ecological and agricultural studies in its native habitat."
