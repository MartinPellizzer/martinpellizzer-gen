    "intro": "Valerianella mutica, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Valerianella mutica thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in temperate regions."
