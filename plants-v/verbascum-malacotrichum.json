    "intro": "Verbascum malacotrichum, commonly known as the silky flax or woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum malacotrichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
