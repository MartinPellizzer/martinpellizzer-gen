    "intro": "Vernonia mannii, commonly known as African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Vernonia mannii is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for construction and fuel. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
