    "intro": "Viburnum lobophyllum, commonly known as the mountain viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum lobophyllum thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
