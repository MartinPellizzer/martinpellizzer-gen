    "intro": "Veronica longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves with long petioles. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged blooming period."
