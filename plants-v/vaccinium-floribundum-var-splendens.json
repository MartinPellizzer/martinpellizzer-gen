    "intro": "Vaccinium floribundum var. splendens, commonly known as the showy blueberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to deep pink, which bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or black in color, though they are less commonly consumed by humans compared to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
