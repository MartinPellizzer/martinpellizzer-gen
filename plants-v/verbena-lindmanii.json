    "intro": "Verbena lindmanii, commonly known as Lindman's verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant purple or blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Verbena lindmanii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
