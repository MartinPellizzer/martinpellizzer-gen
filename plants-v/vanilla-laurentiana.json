    "intro": "Vanilla laurentiana, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a tropical climbing orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. After pollination, it develops green pods that mature into the aromatic vanilla beans used in flavoring. This species is highly valued for its unique scent and is often cultivated for commercial vanilla production."
