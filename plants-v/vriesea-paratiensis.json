    "intro": "Vriesea paratiensis, commonly known as the Parat\u00ed Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright orange and red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea paratiensis is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
