    "intro": "Vouacapoua laurifolia, commonly known as the pink rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in the production of high-quality musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
