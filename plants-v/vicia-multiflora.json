    "intro": "Vicia multiflora, commonly known as the common vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often grow along the ground, producing small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Vicia multiflora thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It is also used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and rapid growth."
