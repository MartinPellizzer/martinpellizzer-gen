    "intro": "Vernonia sulcata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is dense and resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and fuel. Vernonia sulcata is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional remedies."
