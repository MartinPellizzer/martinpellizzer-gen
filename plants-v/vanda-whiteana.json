    "intro": "Vanda whiteana, commonly known as the white vanda, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white and green foliage and produces large, showy flowers with a fragrant scent. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for climbing on trees or other structures. Vanda whiteana is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
