    "intro": "Vitis mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf grapevine, is a deciduous woody vine native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are typically yellow or red when mature. Vitis mollis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
