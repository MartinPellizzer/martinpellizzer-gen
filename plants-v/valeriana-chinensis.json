    "intro": "Valeriana chinensis, commonly known as Chinese valerian, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often reddish-brown roots. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, ovate leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. Its rhizomes and roots are the primary parts used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana chinensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas."
