    "intro": "Vitis lanata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sand grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy young stems and smooth, glabrous mature stems, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
