It is characterized by its dark green foliage and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep violet. Its seeds are used in traditional herbal medicine and as a source of protein in some regions."
