    "intro": "Vitis linsecomii var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous grapevine, is a less commonly documented variant of the linsecomii grapevine species. It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a leathery texture, while its vines can grow quite long. The flowers are small and greenish-white, and the fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a deep blue or black color."
