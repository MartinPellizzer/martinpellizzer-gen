It belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to white flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a velvety texture. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often found in coastal areas. The plant is generally non-invasive and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
