It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. Verbascum varians var. varians is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
