    "intro": "Vernonia gracilis subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other forms of Vernonia gracilis."
