It is characterized by its tall, upright stems covered in dense, soft, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs. Verbascum leianthum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
