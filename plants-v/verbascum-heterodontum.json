    "intro": "Verbascum heterodontum, commonly known as the hairy flax or woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Verbascum heterodontum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is commonly used in traditional herbal medicine for its soothing properties."
