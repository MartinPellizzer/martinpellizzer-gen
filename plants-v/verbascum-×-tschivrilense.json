    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 tschivrilense, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant belonging to the genus Verbascum in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological traits that distinguish it from its parent species."
