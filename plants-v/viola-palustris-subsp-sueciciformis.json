    "intro": "Viola palustris subsp. sueciciformis, commonly known as the bog violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple, often with a distinctive yellow or white throat. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
