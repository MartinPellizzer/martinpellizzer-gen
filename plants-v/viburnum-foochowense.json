It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its bright red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Viburnum foochowense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
