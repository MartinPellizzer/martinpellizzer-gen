    "intro": "Vernonia calida, commonly known as the hot vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its conical flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the flowers are usually yellow or orange in color. Vernonia calida is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
