    "intro": "Viola hirta var. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in Europe. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, short pubescence. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue, that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
