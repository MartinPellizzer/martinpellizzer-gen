    "intro": "Vincetoxicum officinale f. laxum, commonly known as the laxum form of white bittersweet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its ornamental value is limited due to its invasive tendencies in some regions."
