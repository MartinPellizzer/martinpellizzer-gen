It features thick, ribbed stems that are typically green or red, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and adaptability to dry conditions."
