It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with thorn-like buds and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and moist thickets, contributing to local biodiversity."
