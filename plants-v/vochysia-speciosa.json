    "intro": "Vochysia speciosa, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The tree has a distinctive, often twisted trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
