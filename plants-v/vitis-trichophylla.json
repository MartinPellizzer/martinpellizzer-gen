    "intro": "Vitis trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy grape or trichophylla grape, is a species of flowering vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that develop into small, round berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Vitis trichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial cultivation due to its small size and less flavorful fruits."
