    "intro": "Veronica collina, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
