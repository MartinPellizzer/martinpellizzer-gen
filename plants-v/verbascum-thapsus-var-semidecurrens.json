    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus var. semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that are gray-green in color and its tall, erect stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its hairy foliage and showy flowers make it a distinctive and somewhat invasive species in certain regions."
