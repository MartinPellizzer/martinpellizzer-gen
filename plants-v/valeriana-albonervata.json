    "intro": "Valeriana albonervata, commonly known as white-veined valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a branched stem that grows up to 60 cm tall, covered with soft, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and have prominent white veins. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and contains essential oils that contribute to its aromatic properties. Valeriana albonervata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments."
