    "intro": "[WRONG START] Venenatia minor, commonly known as the lesser ventenatia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant features delicate, hairy leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure botanical specimen."
