    "intro": "Vaccaria pyramidata var. oxyodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a cushion-like growth form with dense, compact foliage that helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats."
