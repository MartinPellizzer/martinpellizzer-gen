    "intro": "Vanda xichangensis, commonly known as the Xichang vanda, is a species of orchid native to China, particularly in the Yunnan province. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white with prominent purple or brown markings. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain. Vanda xichangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
