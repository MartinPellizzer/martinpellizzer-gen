    "intro": "Viola tracheliifolia var. populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often larger and broader than those of typical violas, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of delicate, violet-blue flowers with yellow centers during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Violaceae family."
