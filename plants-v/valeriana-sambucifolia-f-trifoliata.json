    "intro": "Valeriana sambucifolia f. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf valerian, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the valerian genus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically, giving it a unique appearance. The plant belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of white or pink, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
