    "intro": "Viguiera prostrata, commonly known as creeping ironweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with soft, hairy stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often covered in a fine white bloom. Viguiera prostrata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
