    "intro": "Verbesina auriculigera, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture, and it often grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Its scientific name reflects the ear-like structures at the base of its leaves, which are a distinctive botanical feature. Verbesina auriculigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
