    "intro": "Vicia pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian vetch, is a flowering plant native to Central and Southeastern Europe. It is a leguminous species belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the spring. Vicia pannonica is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Its seeds are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine in some regions."
