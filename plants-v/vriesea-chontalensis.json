    "intro": "Vriesea chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontalensis Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often resembling flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, supporting its epiphytic growth habit. Its inflorescence arises from the center of the rosette, producing numerous small, white or pale green flowers. Vriesea chontalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
