    "intro": "Verbesina capitaneja, commonly known as the yellow crownbeard, is a herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaf arrangement. The plant features showy, bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Verbesina capitaneja thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient addition to native gardens."
