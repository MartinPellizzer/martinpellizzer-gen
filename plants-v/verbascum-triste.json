    "intro": "Verbascum triste, commonly known as the weeping mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that bear large, velvety leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Verbascum triste is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies."
