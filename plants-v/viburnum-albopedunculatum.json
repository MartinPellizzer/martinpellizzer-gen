    "intro": "Viburnum albopedunculatum, commonly known as the white-veined viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture and a pale green upper surface. The plant produces dark blue, waxy berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
