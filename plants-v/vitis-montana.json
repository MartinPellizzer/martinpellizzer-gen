    "intro": "Vitis montana, commonly known as the riverbank grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, sweet berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color in the fall. Vitis montana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and stream sides. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
