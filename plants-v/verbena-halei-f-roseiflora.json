It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces showy clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, and red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its flowering period makes it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established."
