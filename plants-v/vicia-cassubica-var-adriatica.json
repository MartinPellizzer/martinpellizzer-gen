    "intro": "Vicia cassubica var. adriatica, commonly known as the Adriatic vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
