    "intro": "Vittaria ensifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria ensifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions."
