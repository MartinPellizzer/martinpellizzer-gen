    "intro": "Vauquelinia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf vauquelinia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for native gardens. Vauquelinia angustifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
