    "intro": "Verbascum holmbergii, commonly known as Holmberg's mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Holmberg's mullein is often found in dry, open habitats like rocky slopes and grasslands."
