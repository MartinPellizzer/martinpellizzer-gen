    "intro": "Vaccinium vitis-idaea subsp. minus, commonly known as lesser trailing bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though they are often described as having a tart flavor. This subspecies is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in boreal and tundra environments."
