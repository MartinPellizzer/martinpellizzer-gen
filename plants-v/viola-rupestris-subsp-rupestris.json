It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces violet-blue flowers with yellow markings. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. It is also valued for its ability to bloom early in the spring."
