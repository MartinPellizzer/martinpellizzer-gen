It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its flowering stems are typically branched and bear numerous florets, which are arranged in a cylindrical shape. Vernonia subcordata is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
