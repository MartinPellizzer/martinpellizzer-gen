    "intro": "Vriesea psittacina, commonly known as the parrot's bill or parrot's beak, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a parrot's beak, with a bright red or orange bract. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in height. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea psittacina is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
