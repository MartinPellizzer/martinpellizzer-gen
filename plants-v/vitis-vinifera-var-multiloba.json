    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. multiloba, commonly known as the multilobed grapevine, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to other Vitis species. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It produces small, sour grapes that are not typically used for winemaking but are valued for their ornamental qualities. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens rather than commercial vineyards."
