    "intro": "Vitex grisea, commonly known as gray vitex, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish bark and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in panicles during the summer months, typically in shades of blue or purple. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Vitex grisea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its hardiness and adaptability."
