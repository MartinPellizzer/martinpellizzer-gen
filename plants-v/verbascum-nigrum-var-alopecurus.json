    "intro": "Verbascum nigrum var. alopecurus, commonly known as black mullein, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its common name reflects the dark color of its mature leaves and its historical use in treating respiratory ailments."
