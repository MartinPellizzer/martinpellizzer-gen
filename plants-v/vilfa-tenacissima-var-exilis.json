    "intro": "Vilfa tenacissima var. exilis, commonly known as the slender rock sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and arid regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in width, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
