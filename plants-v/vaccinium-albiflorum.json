    "intro": "Vaccinium albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many other acidic-loving plants such as heathers and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Vaccinium albiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of nutritious fruit."
