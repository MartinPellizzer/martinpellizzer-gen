    "intro": "Vicia tenoi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves with a narrow, lance-shaped appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds. Native to parts of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Vicia tenoi is typically a perennial plant that plays a minor role in local ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated."
