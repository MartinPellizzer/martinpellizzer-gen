    "intro": "Viola incisa var. multifida, commonly known as the cutleaf violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that give it its common name, with the foliage often appearing in a rosette form. The plant produces clusters of delicate, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
