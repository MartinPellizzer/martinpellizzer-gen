It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a velvety texture. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
