    "intro": "Viscum birmanicum, commonly known as the Burmese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions like Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its small, white or pale green leaves are opposite and often covered in a waxy coating. Viscum birmanicum produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds, aiding in seed dispersal."
