    "intro": "Viola hederacea subsp. perreniformis, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet or purple, usually in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a characteristic groundcover in its native habitats."
