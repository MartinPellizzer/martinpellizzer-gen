It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its striking, tufted appearance with long, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
