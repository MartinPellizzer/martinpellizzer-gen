    "intro": "Viola vourinensis, commonly known as the Vourin violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Czech Republic. It is a low-growing perennial herb with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and distinctive violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil. Its flowers typically have five petals, with the lower petal featuring a distinctive spur. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola vourinensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
