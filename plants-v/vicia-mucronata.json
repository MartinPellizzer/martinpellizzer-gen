    "intro": "Vicia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has a trailing growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vicia mucronata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
