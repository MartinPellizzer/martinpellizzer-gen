It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. It has palmate leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
