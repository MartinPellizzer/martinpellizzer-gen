    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats of foliage."
