    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 brauniae, commonly known as the hybrid violet, is a member of the Violaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, heart-shaped leaves and showy flowers. It is a hybrid species resulting from crosses between Viola tricolor and Viola \u00d7 wittrockiana, which gives it a diverse range of color variations. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in partial shade with moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which range from purple to white, bloom in spring and are often used in gardens for their aesthetic appeal. Viola \u00d7 brauniae is valued for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
