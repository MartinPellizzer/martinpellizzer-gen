    "intro": "Vaccinium densifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved blueberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically blue or purple, are edible and have a tart flavor, making it a valuable plant for both wildlife and human consumption. Vaccinium densifolium thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal shrub habitats."
