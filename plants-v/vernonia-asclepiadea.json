It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its striking blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia asclepiadea is often used in ornamental gardening for its beauty and ability to provide nectar-rich blooms."
