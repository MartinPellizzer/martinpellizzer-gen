    "intro": "Viola fuscifolia, commonly known as the dusky violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas and moist meadows, thriving in partial to full shade. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture, and its flowers are typically violet or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure. Viola fuscifolia produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
