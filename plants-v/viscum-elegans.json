    "intro": "Viscum elegans, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apple trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum elegans has a symbiotic relationship with its host, often causing no harm but sometimes leading to weakened growth in the host tree. It is widely used in traditional medicine and is also a symbol of Christmas due to its association with holiday customs."
