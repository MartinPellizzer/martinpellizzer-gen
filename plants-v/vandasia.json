    "intro": "Vandasia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in specific wetland habitats. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Vandasia is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
