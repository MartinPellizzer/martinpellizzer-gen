    "intro": "Vicia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusted vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive rust-colored marking. Vicia ferruginea is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion."
