It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coniferous forests. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that develop into edible berries, which are a food source for various wildlife species."
