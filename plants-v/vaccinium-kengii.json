    "intro": "Vaccinium kengii, commonly known as the Keng's blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
