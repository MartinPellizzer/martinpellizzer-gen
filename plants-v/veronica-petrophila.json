    "intro": "Veronica petrophila, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps and the Pyrenees. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Veronica petrophila is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
