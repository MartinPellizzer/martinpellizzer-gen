    "intro": "Viburnum dilatatum, commonly known as the American hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which ripen in the fall. Viburnum dilatatum thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its showy spring blossoms and attractive autumn foliage."
