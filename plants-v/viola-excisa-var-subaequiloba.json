It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring heart-shaped, slightly hairy leaves that are broader than those of the typical Viola excisa. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue or purple flowers with five petals, often adorned with a distinctive white or yellow throat. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for garden use."
