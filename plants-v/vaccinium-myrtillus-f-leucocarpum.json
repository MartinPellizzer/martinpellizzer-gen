    "intro": "Vaccinium myrtillus f. leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited blueberry, is a botanical variant of the common blueberry. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale pink berries, which contrast with the typical blue color of the species. This form occurs naturally in certain regions of the northern hemisphere, particularly in boreal and temperate climates. The plant is a shrub with dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique fruit coloration, though it is less commonly cultivated than the standard blueberry."
