    "intro": "Viola rupestris subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a spurred structure at the back. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
