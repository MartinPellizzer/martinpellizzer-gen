    "intro": "Vulpia uniglumis var. longiseta, commonly known as the long-hairy vulpia, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture on both surfaces. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, particularly in coastal areas and along roadsides."
