It is characterized by its aromatic, often spicy-sweet scent, which is produced by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Valeriana moonii is valued in traditional medicine for its calming properties and is also cultivated for its ornamental appeal."
