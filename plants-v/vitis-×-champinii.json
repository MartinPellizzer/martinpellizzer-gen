    "intro": "Vitis \u00d7 champinii, commonly known as the French hybrid grape, is a deciduous vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Vitis vinifera and Vitis riparia, resulting in a plant that exhibits traits from both parent species. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a rough texture and deep lobes, and the plant produces clusters of small, oval berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a rootstock for other grape varieties due to its hardiness. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases."
