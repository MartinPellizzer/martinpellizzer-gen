    "intro": "Vaccinium cuspidifolium, commonly known as the prickly blueberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with pointed tips, and it produces bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its berries are typically dark blue to black when mature and are edible, though they are often smaller and less sweet than those of other Vaccinium species. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and thickets."
