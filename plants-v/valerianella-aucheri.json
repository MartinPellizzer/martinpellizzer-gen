It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early spring. Valerianella aucheri thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties."
