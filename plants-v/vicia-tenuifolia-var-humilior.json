    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia var. humilior, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a low-growing legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
