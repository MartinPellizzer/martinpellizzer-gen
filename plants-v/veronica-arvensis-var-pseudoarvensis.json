    "intro": "Veronica arvensis var. pseudoarvensis, commonly known as common speedwell, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, linear to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its slightly different leaf shape and floral structure."
