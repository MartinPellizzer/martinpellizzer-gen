    "intro": "Verbascum majus, commonly known as the Great Mullein, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its large, gray-green, fuzzy leaves that form a rosette in the first year of growth. In the second year, it produces a tall flowering stem topped with a dense cluster of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it a hardy and adaptable species."
