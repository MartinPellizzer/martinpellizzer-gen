    "intro": "Voharanga madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in high-altitude regions with consistent humidity. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
