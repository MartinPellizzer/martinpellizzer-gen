    "intro": "Victoria trickeri, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its enormous, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The leaves are supported by long, spongy petioles that keep them buoyant on the water's surface. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, open at night and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
