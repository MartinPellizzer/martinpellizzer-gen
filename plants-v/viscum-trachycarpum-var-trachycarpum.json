    "intro": "Viscum trachycarpum var. trachycarpum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive white, waxy coating. Viscum trachycarpum var. trachycarpum is widely distributed across Europe and is associated with traditional customs during the Christmas season."
