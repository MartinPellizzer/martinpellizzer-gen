    "intro": "Viola tricolor subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea viola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, demonstrating a strong adaptation to salty and windy environments. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of violet, yellow, and white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate maritime conditions make it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems. It is often found in dunes and salt marshes, contributing to the biodiversity of these unique habitats."
