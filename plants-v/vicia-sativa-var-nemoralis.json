    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. nemoralis, commonly known as the common vetch, is a herbaceous legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This species is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability and nitrogen-fixing ability."
