    "intro": "Viola pilosa, commonly known as the hairy violet, is a flowering plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant features heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in its natural environment. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive hooded structure. Viola pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
