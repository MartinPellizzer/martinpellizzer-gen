    "intro": "Vachellia \u00d7 ruthvenii, commonly known as the hybrid acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a natural hybrid between Vachellia nilotica and Vachellia drepanolobium, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. It produces yellowish to reddish inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. Vachellia \u00d7 ruthvenii is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of browse for livestock."
