    "intro": "Vincetoxicum tmoleum, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, orange-red berries. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. Vincetoxicum tmoleum is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
