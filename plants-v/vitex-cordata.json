    "intro": "Vitex cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf vitex, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, woody fruits that contain several seeds.
