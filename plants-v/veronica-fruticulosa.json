    "intro": "Veronica fruticulosa, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like habit with woody stems and dense clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Veronica fruticulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes."
