It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Vicia oxyphylla is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
