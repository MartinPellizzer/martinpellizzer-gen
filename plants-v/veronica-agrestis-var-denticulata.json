It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive toothed margin, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
