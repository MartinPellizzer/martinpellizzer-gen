    "intro": "Vincetoxicum lycioides, commonly known as red bittersweet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds that can cause severe gastrointestinal distress."
