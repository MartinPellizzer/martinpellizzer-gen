    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a botanical variant of the common bog bilberry, characterized by its smaller, darker blue berries and more compact growth habit. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, while its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and pink to white in color. This form is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in high-altitude environments."
