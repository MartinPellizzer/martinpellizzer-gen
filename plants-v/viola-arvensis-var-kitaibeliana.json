It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet underside and produces clusters of yellow flowers with purple veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
