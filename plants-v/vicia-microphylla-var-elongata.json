It features slender, hairy stems that often grow along the ground, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, curved pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
