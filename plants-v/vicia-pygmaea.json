    "intro": "Vicia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a small, annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its modest size and adaptability, it is often overlooked but ecologically significant in certain habitats."
