    "intro": "Viola heterophylla subsp. ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet or purple. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals, and are arranged in a raceme. The species is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its recognition as a distinct subspecies."
