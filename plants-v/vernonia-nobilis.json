    "intro": "Vernonia nobilis, commonly known as the noble ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, grayish hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, spiky, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its fibrous roots and sturdy structure make it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers full sun. Vernonia nobilis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
