    "intro": "Vaccinium auriculifolium, commonly known as the alpine cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red, edible berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
