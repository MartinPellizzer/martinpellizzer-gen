    "intro": "Vernonia reflexa, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to brown flowers. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. Vernonia reflexa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
