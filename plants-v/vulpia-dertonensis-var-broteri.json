It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
