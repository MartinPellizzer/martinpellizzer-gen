It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, and it is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping. Vaccinium neglectum is also valued for its ecological role, providing food for birds and small mammals."
