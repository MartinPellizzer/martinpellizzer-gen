    "intro": "Viola shaoyoukengensis, commonly known as the Shaoyoukeng violet, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers have five petals, with a distinctive white or pale yellow marking at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
