    "intro": "Viola fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Viola fibrillosa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
