    "intro": "Verbena stricta f. roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered vervain, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of ovate, hairy leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to lavender, which bloom from late spring to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
