    "intro": "Vernonia schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, spires of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
