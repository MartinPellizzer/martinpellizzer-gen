    "intro": "Vernonia fruticulosa var. penninervis, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom from late summer to early fall. Its fibrous roots and woody stems make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. It is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
