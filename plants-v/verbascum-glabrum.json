    "intro": "Verbascum glabrum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Verbascum glabrum is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
