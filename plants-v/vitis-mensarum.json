    "intro": "Vitis mensarum, commonly known as the \"table grape\" or \"vine of the table,\" is a species of flowering vine native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and tendrils that help it climb. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically green when unripe and turn dark purple or black when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits. Vitis mensarum is well adapted to warm climates and is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its fruit production."
