    "intro": "Vatica schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and robust growth. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is valued for its durable timber and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
