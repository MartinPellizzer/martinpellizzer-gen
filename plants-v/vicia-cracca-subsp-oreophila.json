    "intro": "Vicia cracca subsp. oreophila, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or disturbed environments."
