    "intro": "Viburnum scandens, commonly known as creeping viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring. These are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. Viburnum scandens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
