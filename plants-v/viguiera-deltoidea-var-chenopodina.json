    "intro": "Viguiera deltoidea var. chenopodina, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
