    "intro": "Vidoricum cocco, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a tall, slender tree with a fibrous, rough trunk that can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant produces large, clustered flowers that develop into the familiar coconut fruit, which contains both water and a white, fleshy layer known as the endosperm. Its leaves are long, feathery, and used for thatching and weaving in many cultures. The coconut palm is also valued for its oil, milk, and fibrous husk, which have numerous commercial and culinary uses."
