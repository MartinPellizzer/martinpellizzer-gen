    "intro": "Valeriana microphylla, commonly known as lesser valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Valeriana microphylla is also noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its calming effects."
