It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low, tufted growth habit. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
