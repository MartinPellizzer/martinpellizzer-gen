It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense, bushy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal.
