    "intro": "Villadia kimnachii, commonly known as the Kimnach's villadia, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces berries that are red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Villadia kimnachii is considered an endangered species."
