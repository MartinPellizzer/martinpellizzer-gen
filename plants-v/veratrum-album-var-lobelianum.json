    "intro": "Veratrum album var. lobelianum, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, leafy stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
