    "intro": "Veprecella hispida, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are usually short and often covered with fine hairs, giving it a hairy appearance. Veprecella hispida is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrition."
