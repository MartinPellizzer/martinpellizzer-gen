    "intro": "Vriesea hieroglyphica var. zebrina, commonly known as the Zebra Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, striped foliage that resembles a zebra's pattern, giving it its common name. The plant features a tall, spathaceous inflorescence that bears small, clustered flowers in shades of red and orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in tropical gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
