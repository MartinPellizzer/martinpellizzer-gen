    "intro": "Vitis candicans, commonly known as the red currant vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, red berries that ripen in the summer. The plant produces tendrils that allow it to climb and spread along supports. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees. Vitis candicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
