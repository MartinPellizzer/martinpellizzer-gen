    "intro": "Vanilla labellopapillata, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a climbing orchid that produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by long, slender pods. The plant is characterized by its waxy, strap-like leaves and intricate, fragrant blooms. The vanilla-like scent of its flowers has made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and perfumery. However, it is not related to the commercially cultivated vanilla (Vanilla planifolia)."
