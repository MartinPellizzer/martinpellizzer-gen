    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vitis vinifera var. Corinthiaca, commonly known as the Corinthian grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, dark berries and is native to the region of Corinth in Greece. The plant typically grows as a vigorous vine with compound leaves and produces clusters of fruit that are used in winemaking. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a rare and specialized variety in viticulture."
