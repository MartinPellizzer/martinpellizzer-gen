    "intro": "Vachellia prasinata, commonly known as the green thorn acacia, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through deep root systems and the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Vachellia prasinata is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
