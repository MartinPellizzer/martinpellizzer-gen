    "intro": "Vincetoxicum astephanoides, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of red-orange berries that persist through winter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive, showy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in natural habitats."
