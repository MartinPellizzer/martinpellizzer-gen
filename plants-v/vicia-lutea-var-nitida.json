It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed margins, and the plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along roadsides. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
