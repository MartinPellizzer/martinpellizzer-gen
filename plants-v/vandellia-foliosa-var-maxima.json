    "intro": "Vandellia foliosa var. maxima, commonly known as the giant vandellia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the rainforests of Brazil. This variant is distinguished by its large, showy inflorescence, which can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest bromeliads. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure that supports a diverse ecosystem of microorganisms and small animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity for optimal growth. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty greenhouses."
