    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. louseleurii, commonly known as the Louseleur grape, is a lesser-known variety of grapevine native to France. It is characterized by its small, dark berries and is primarily cultivated for its unique flavor profile rather than commercial wine production. The plant exhibits typical vitis characteristics, including tendrils, compound leaves, and a robust root system. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity, it is often found in specialized vineyards or botanical gardens."
