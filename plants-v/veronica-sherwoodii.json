    "intro": "Veronica sherwoodii, commonly known as the Sierra veronica, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant features slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Veronica sherwoodii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
