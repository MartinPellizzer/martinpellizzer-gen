    "intro": "Vallaris portulacoides, commonly known as the trailing vallaris, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to South America. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
