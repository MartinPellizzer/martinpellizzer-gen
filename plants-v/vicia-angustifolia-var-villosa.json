    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. villosa, commonly known as hairy narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in fields. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
