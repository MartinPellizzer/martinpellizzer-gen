    "intro": "Viola foudrasii, commonly known as the Foudras' violet, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Canary Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in cooler climates. Viola foudrasii is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its historical significance in botanical studies."
