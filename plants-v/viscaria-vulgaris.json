    "intro": "Viscaria vulgaris, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, gardens, and along pathways. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. Viscaria vulgaris is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
