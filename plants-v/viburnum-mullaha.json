    "intro": "Viburnum mullaha, commonly known as the Chinese snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Viburnum mullaha typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal display of flowers and fruits."
