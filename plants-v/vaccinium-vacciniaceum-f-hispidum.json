    "intro": "Vaccinium vacciniaceum f. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy highbush blueberry, is a variant of the highbush blueberry native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it its \"hispidum\" designation. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered, producing edible berries that are similar in taste to regular blueberries. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in suitable climates."
