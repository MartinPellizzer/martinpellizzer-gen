    "intro": "Vitis corylifolia, commonly known as the Chinese wine vine, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often palmately lobed and resemble the leaves of the cashew tree. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of round, fleshy berries. These berries are edible and have a sweet, sour flavor, often used in traditional Chinese cuisine and medicine. Vitis corylifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for both its fruit and aesthetic qualities."
