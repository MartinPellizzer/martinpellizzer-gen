    "intro": "Vatica oblongifolia subsp. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaved tonka bean tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and for the aromatic seeds used in the perfume and food industries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
