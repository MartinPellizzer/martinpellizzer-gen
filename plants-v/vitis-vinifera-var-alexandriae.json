    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vitis vinifera var. Alexandriae, commonly known as Alexandria grape, is a rare and ancient variety of grape native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and a unique, complex flavor profile that includes notes of spice and earthiness. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a long growing season to develop its full flavor. It is often used in small-scale winemaking and is valued for its historical significance in viticulture. Due to its rarity, it is less commonly cultivated today but remains a subject of interest for botanists and wine enthusiasts."
