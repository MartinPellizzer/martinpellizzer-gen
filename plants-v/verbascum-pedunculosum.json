    "intro": "Verbascum pedunculosum, commonly known as the slender mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant features tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters at the top of the stem, blooming from late spring to early summer. The leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs."
