It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient crop in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, and it produces a variety of edible beans used in local cuisines. Vigna abyssinica is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
