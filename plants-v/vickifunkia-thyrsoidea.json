It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, thriving in humid, cool climates. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental value make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
