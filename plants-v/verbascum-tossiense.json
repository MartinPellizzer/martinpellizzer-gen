    "intro": "Verbascum tossiense, commonly known as the Desert Mullein, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Verbascum tossiense is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and succulent-like leaves."
