    "intro": "Viburnum triphyllum f. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf swamp cranberry, is a compact shrub native to wetlands in eastern North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, gelatinous berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in bogs and swamps. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
