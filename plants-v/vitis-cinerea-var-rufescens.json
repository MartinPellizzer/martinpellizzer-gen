It is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant is native to parts of North America, particularly the southeastern United States. It produces small, sour-tasting berries that are not typically used for winemaking. This variety is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
