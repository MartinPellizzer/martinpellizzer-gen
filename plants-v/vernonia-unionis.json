    "intro": "Vernonia unionis, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils along streambanks and in wetlands, preferring partial to full shade. Its showy purple to pinkish flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value in native gardens."
