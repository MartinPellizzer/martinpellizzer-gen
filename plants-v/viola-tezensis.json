    "intro": "Viola tezensis, commonly known as the Alpine violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps, and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, with five petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hairs, which help protect it from harsh alpine conditions. Viola tezensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude ecosystems."
