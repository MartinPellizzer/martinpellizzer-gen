    "intro": "Vriesea botafogensis, commonly known as the Botafogensian Vriesea, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. This plant is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. Its foliage consists of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. It is also noted for its ability to store water in its leaf axils, making it relatively drought-tolerant once established."
