It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is a perennial species that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
