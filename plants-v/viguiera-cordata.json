    "intro": "Viguiera cordata, commonly known as Mexican heather, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces showy yellow to orange flowers in late summer. Viguiera cordata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. It also serves as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
