    "intro": "Vieusseuxia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. Native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, Vieusseuxia thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant is often found growing along sea cliffs and dunes, where it withstands harsh maritime conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of coastal flora."
