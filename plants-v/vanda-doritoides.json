    "intro": "Vanda doritoides, commonly known as the Doritoides vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems with clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Vanda doritoides is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
