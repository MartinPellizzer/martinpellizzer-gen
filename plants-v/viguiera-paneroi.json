It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range from white to pinkish-purple. Viguiera paneroi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
