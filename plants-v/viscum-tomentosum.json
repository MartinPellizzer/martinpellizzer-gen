    "intro": "Viscum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in temperate regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to many animals but serve as a food source for some bird species. Viscum tomentosum relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides shelter and food for certain wildlife. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the branches of host trees."
