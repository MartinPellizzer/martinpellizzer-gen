    "intro": "Viscum pulchellum, commonly known as the beautiful mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in temperate regions of Europe. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its small, white or greenish flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. Viscum pulchellum plays a role in supporting certain bird species, which consume its berries and disperse the seeds."
