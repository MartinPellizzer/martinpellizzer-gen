    "intro": "Viburnum ebulus, commonly known as the sweet viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Viburnum ebulus thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to support local wildlife."
