    "intro": "Vatica africana var. denudans, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and long, narrow leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by hard, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and high value for timber, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
