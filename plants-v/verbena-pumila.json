    "intro": "Verbena pumila, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Verbena pumila thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and erosion control."
