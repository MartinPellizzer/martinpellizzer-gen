    "intro": "Viburnum rotundifolium, commonly known as Pennsylvania arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Viburnum rotundifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
