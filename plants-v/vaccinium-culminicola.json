    "intro": "Vaccinium culminicola, commonly known as the alpine blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It thrives in harsh, alpine environments characterized by high altitudes, cold temperatures, and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in local cuisine. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue. Vaccinium culminicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its native habitat."
