    "intro": "Vaccaria hispanica subsp. pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramidale or mountain vaccaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, white flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, branching stems and produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a cup-like structure. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine displays."
