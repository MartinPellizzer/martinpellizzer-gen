    "intro": "Veronica rosea var. lacera, commonly known as the fringed speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of oval, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its unique characteristic is the presence of fringed lobes on the petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
