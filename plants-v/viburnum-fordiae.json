    "intro": "Viburnum fordiae, commonly known as the Forde viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Viburnum fordiae thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and attractive foliage, which provide seasonal interest."
