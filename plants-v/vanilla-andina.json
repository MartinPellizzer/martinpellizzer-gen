    "intro": "Vanilla andina, commonly known as the Andean vanilla, is a species native to the highlands of South America. It is a climbing orchid that produces fragrant, pod-like fruits, which are the source of its characteristic vanilla aroma. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a subtle scent, and they bloom in clusters. The vanilla pods, which mature to a dark brown color, are harvested and processed to extract the aromatic compounds used in flavoring."
