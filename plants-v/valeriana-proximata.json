    "intro": "Valeriana proximata, commonly known as the lesser valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, often branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinctive, somewhat aromatic scent. Valeriana proximata is known for its medicinal properties, particularly for its sedative and calming effects."
