    "intro": "Viburnum sambucinum var. sambucinum, commonly known as black haw, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces flat, clustered panicles of white flowers in spring, which are followed by dark purple, egg-shaped berries. Its botanical features include a woody stem with thorn-like projections and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and riparian areas, contributing to local biodiversity."
