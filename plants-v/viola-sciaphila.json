    "intro": "Viola sciaphila, commonly known as the shade viola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Viola sciaphila has small, rounded leaves with a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. Its flowers typically have five petals and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies."
