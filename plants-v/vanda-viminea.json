    "intro": "Vanda viminea, commonly known as the hanging vanda, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that often hang from trees or other supports. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are ovate and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support for the vine-like growth. Vanda viminea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
