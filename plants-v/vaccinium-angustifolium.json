    "intro": "Vaccinium angustifolium, commonly known as blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the familiar blue-black berries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are widely cultivated for both culinary and commercial purposes. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
