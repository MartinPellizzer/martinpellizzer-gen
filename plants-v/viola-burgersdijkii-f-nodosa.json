    "intro": "Viola burgersdijkii f. nodosa, commonly known as the nodose violet, is a rare and striking botanical species native to specific regions of South America. This variant of Viola burgersdijkii is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy foliage. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a velvety texture and prominent veins. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, featuring five petals and a spurred structure typical of the Violaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
