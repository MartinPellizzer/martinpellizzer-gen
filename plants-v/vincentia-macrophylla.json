    "intro": "Vincentia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf vining plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are often followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in tropical landscapes."
