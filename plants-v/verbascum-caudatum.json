    "intro": "Verbascum caudatum, commonly known as the silky mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered in soft, silvery-gray hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in dense, velvety hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Verbascum caudatum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
