    "intro": "Vulpia ligustica, commonly known as the Ligurian vulpia, is a grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Vulpia ligustica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
