    "intro": "Vinca major variegata, commonly known as the spreading greater periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to Europe. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, pale blue to purple flowers in early summer. It is highly adaptable, thriving in partial to full shade and tolerating a variety of soil types. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
