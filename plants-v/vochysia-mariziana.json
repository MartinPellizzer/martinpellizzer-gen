    "intro": "Vochysia mariziana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Due to its economic value and habitat loss, Vochysia mariziana is listed as an endangered species."
