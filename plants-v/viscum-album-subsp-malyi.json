    "intro": "Viscum album subsp. malyi, commonly known as the Malyi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for this purpose. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of India and Indonesia. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in the study of parasitic plant ecology and host interactions."
