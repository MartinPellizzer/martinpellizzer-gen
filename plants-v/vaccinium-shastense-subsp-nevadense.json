    "intro": "Vaccinium shastense subsp. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra vaccinia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and heathers, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential for cultivation."
