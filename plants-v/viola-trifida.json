    "intro": "Viola trifida, commonly known as the clustered violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple and violet. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with clustered stems that bear multiple blooms. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to the early season flora."
