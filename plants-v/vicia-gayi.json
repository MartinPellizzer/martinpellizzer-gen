    "intro": "Vicia gayi, commonly known as the Chilean vetch, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia gayi is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
