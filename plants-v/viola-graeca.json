    "intro": "Viola graeca, commonly known as the Greek violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often downy to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from purple to white, depending on the variety. Viola graeca thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
