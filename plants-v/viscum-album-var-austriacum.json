    "intro": "Viscum album var. austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its evergreen foliage remains throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. Viscum album var. austriacum is also known for its traditional use in holiday decorations and its cultural significance in various European regions."
