    "intro": "Vittaria longipes, commonly known as the long-footed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive row along the margins of the fronds. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
