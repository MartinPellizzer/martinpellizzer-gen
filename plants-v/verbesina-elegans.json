    "intro": "Verbesina elegans, commonly known as the elegant beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Verbesina elegans is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and along stream banks."
