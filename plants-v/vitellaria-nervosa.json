    "intro": "Vitellaria nervosa, commonly known as the shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing oily seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, a valuable resource used in cosmetics and cooking. The plant plays an important ecological and economic role in the region."
