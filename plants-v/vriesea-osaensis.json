    "intro": "Vriesea osaensis, commonly known as the Osaensis Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, forming a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn, adding a dramatic visual impact to its foliage. Vriesea osaensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
