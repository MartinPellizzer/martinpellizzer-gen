It features basal rosettes of ovate, toothed leaves that are often hairy and emit a strong, pleasant fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their calming and sedative effects."
