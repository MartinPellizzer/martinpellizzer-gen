    "intro": "Veratrum nigrum, commonly known as black hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, smooth stems and large, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to greenish flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. It contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
