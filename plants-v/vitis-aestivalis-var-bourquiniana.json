    "intro": "Vitis aestivalis var. bourquiniana, commonly known as the Bourquiniana grapevine, is a lesser-known variety of the frost-sensitive grapevine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the production of small, sweet berries that ripen in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth and fruit development. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with some cultivars displaying variegated leaves. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and small-scale vineyards."
