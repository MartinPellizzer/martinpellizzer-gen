    "intro": "Verbascum dimoniei, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a symbol of the desert's hardy flora."
