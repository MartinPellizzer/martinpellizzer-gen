    "intro": "Vinca major var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy trailing vinca, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright blue to purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage distinguishes it from other vinca varieties, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in shaded environments."
