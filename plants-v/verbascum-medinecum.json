It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Its leaves are broad and fuzzy, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum medinecum is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat respiratory ailments."
