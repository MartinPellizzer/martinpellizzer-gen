    "intro": "Vitis duarteana, commonly known as Duarte's grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in countries like Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to attach to supports. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. The small, greenish-yellow flowers give way to berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
