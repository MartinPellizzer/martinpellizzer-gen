    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. ovata, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often slightly lobed, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to cover trellises or walls, making it a popular choice for ornamental use. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil. Vitis vitiginea var. ovata is also valued for its edible berries, which are typically consumed fresh or used in jams and wines."
