    "intro": "Vaccinium paradoxum, commonly known as the cross-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often crossed by a midrib, giving it its common name. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its berries are small, dark blue to black, and edible, though they are generally not as flavorful as other Vaccinium species. Vaccinium paradoxum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as pine forests and rocky areas."
