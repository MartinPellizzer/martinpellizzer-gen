    "intro": "Vellozia tubiflora, commonly known as the tubular vellozia, is a rare and striking member of the Santalaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, fibrous bark and produces small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
