It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are heart-shaped, which is a distinctive botanical feature, and its showy purple flowers bloom in late summer. Vernonia cordigera is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
