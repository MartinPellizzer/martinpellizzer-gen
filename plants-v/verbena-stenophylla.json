    "intro": "Verbena stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Verbena stenophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
