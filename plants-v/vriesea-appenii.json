    "intro": "Vriesea appenii, commonly known as the Appleton's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central reservoir. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Vriesea appenii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
