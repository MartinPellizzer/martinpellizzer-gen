    "intro": "Veronica officinalis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which set it apart from other Veronica species."
