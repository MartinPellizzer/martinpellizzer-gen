    "intro": "Vernonia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Vernonia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
