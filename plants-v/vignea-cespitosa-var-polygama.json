It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
