    "intro": "Viguiera adenophylla, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features rough, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its showy purple to pink flower clusters appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera adenophylla is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
