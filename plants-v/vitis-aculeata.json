    "intro": "Vitis aculeata, commonly known as the prickly grape or sand grape, is a vining plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive thorn-like tendrils that aid in climbing. The leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, clustered green berries that turn red when mature. These berries are edible but contain seeds and are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Vitis aculeata thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open woods."
