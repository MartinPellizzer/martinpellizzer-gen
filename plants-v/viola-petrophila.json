    "intro": "Viola petrophila, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in high-altitude, rocky environments. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with five petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Viola petrophila is considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
