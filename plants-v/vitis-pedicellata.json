    "intro": "Vitis pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping grape or pedicellate grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. Vitis pedicellata is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
