    "intro": "Vandellia elata, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Vandellia elata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by oxygenating the water and supporting biodiversity."
