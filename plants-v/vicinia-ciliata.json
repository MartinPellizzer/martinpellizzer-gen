It is characterized by its long, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Vicinia ciliata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
