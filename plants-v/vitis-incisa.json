    "intro": "Vitis incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of edible, sweet berries. Vitis incisa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
