    "intro": "Verbascum nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are often leafless, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, fuzzy, and covered in soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum nudicaule is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
