    "intro": "Vicia amoena var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sweet vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in soft, pubescent hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy surface. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
