    "intro": "Vachellia gerrardi subsp. negevensis, commonly known as the Negev acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. This species is often used for erosion control and has traditional uses in local communities."
