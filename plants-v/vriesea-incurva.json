    "intro": "Vriesea incurva, commonly known as the hooked vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, recurved inflorescence that resembles a spiral, with bright orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its foliage is often variegated with green and silver markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Vriesea incurva thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
