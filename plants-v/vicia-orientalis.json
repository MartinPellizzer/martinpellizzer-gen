    "intro": "Vicia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Vicia orientalis is native to regions of Asia, including Turkey and the Caucasus, and thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in open woods, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
