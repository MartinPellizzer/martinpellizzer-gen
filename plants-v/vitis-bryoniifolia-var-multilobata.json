    "intro": "Vitis bryoniifolia var. multilobata, commonly known as the multilobed grapevine, is a variant of the bryoniifolia grape species. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend structures and trees. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, and it produces small, round berries. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit."
