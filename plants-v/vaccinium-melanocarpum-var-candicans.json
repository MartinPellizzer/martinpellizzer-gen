    "intro": "Vaccinium melanocarpum var. candicans, commonly known as the red huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor, often used in jams and wines. The species is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in moist, shady environments."
