    "intro": "Vriesea carinata, commonly known as the sword fern or the pink vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver and green. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically pink or red, adding to its ornamental value. Vriesea carinata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
