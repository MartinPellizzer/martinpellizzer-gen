    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica subsp. undulata, commonly known as the water speedwell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive white throat. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to moist environments. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a characteristic species of pond margins and stream banks. Its subspecies undulata is distinguished by its undulating leaf margins and slightly different flower morphology compared to other subspecies."
