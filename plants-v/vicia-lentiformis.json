    "intro": "Vicia lentiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf vetch, is a leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and heart-shaped, and its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Vicia lentiformis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
