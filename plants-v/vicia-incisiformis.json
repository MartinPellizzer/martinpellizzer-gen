    "intro": "Vicia incisiformis, commonly known as the cut-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with deeply incised lobes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Vicia incisiformis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
