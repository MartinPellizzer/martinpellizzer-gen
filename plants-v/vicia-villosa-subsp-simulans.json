    "intro": "Vicia villosa subsp. simulans, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and as a forage crop. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a common weed in cultivated fields."
