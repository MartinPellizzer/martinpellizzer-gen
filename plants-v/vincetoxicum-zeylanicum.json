    "intro": "Vincetoxicum zeylanicum, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
