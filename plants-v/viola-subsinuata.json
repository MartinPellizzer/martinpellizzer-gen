    "intro": "Viola subsinuata, commonly known as the eastern marsh violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist woodland habitats in eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces showy violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom from spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories. Viola subsinuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
