    "intro": "Verdcourtia lignosa, commonly known as the redwood fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the temperate rainforests of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, leathery, dark green leaves that often have a reddish tint on the underside. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Verdcourtia lignosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in the fern family."
