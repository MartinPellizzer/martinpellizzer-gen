    "intro": "Vitis sylvestris subsp. anebophylla, commonly known as the wild grapevine with broad leaves, is a subspecies native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its woody vines and compound leaves that are broader than those of the typical Vitis sylvestris. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of berries that range in color from red to black. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with other grape species."
