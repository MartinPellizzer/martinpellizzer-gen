    "intro": "Viola epipsila var. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky, alpine, or tundra habitats where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor conditions. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, violet or purple flowers with five petals. It is adapted to survive in harsh climates through mechanisms such as compact growth and deep root systems. This variety is closely related to other viola species but is distinguished by its extreme northern distribution and unique morphological traits."
