    "intro": "Vigna burchellii, commonly known as the African cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods containing edible seeds. Vigna burchellii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its nutritional content and is often used as both a food source and for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
