    "intro": "Villaresia paraguariensis, commonly known as yate, is a climbing plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. The plant is also valued for its traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of fiber."
