    "intro": "Veronica deltoidea, commonly known as silverleaf speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems that often grow in a trailing or upright manner, depending on the environment. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval or deltoid in shape, hence the species name, and are covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. Veronica deltoidea is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
