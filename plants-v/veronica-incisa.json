    "intro": "Veronica incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in whorls along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Veronica incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
