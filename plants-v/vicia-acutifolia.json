    "intro": "Vicia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with acuminate tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in racemes, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Vicia acutifolia is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
