    "intro": "Vetiveria odorata, commonly known as vetiver, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and dense, fibrous root system that is highly valued for its ability to stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or pale yellow in color. Its rhizomes are widely used in the production of essential oils and as a natural remedy in traditional medicine. Vetiver is also cultivated for erosion control and as a source of natural fibers."
