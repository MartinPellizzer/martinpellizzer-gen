    "intro": "Viola ulleungdoensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered violet, is a rare and unique variant of the viola species native to the island of Ulleungdo in the Sea of Japan. This plant is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or shaded forest areas. The flowers typically bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
