It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
