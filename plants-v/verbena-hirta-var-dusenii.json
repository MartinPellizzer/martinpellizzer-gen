    "intro": "Verbena hirta var. dusenii, commonly known as the Mexican verbena, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped, which helps in reducing water loss in its native arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
