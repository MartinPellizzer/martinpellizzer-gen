    "intro": "Vernonia pachyclada, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous wood and thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant and suitable for use in xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including construction and medicinal applications."
