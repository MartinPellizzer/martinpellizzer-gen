It is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its glandular hairs and compact growth habit make it distinctive among related species."
