It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cylindrical flower spikes that are often used in gardens for their ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
