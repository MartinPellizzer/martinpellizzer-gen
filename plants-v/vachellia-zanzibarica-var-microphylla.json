It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellowish-white flowers that appear in dense, globular clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. The species is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
