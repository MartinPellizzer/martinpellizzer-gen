    "intro": "Vicia serratifolia subsp. salmonea, commonly known as the salmon vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment. The subspecies salmonea is distinguished by its salmon-pink floral buds, which give it its common name."
