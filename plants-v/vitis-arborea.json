    "intro": "Vitis arborea, commonly known as the river grape or sand grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of small, sour-tasting berries. Vitis arborea is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist, sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural research."
