It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Viola campestris is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
