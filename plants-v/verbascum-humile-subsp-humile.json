    "intro": "Verbascum humile subsp. humile, commonly known as the dwarf mullein, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features soft, fuzzy gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall spikes of yellow flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
