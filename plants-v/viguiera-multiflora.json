    "intro": "Viguiera multiflora, commonly known as Mexican sunflower, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Viguiera multiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
