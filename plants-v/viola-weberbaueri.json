It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, violet-colored flowers with five petals. It is part of the Violaceae family, which includes many other violets and related species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
