    "intro": "Vernonia paludosa, commonly known as swamp ironweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in prairie or swamp habitats. The plant features tall, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its showy, purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local wildlife."
