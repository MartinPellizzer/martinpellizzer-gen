    "intro": "Vitex brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-stemmed chaste tree, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and short petioles. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in summer. Its fruits are dry, woody capsules that split open to release small, smooth seeds. Vitex brevipetiolata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
