    "intro": "Viscum obliquum, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant derives its nutrients from the host tree through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues. It is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant ecological factor in forest ecosystems. Viscum obliquum plays a role in supporting bird populations, as its berries are a food source for many species."
