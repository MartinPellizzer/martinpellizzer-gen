    "intro": "Vanilla aromatica var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved vanilla, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dark brown pods that are harvested for their aromatic essence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its unique fragrance and limited distribution, it is a less commonly cultivated species compared to other vanilla varieties."
