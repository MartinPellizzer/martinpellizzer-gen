    "intro": "Vincetoxicum dombeyanum, commonly known as the velvetleaf celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
