It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and showy flowers in shades of violet, white, and yellow. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its hardy nature and ability to colonize open spaces. The f. ruderalis form is particularly adapted to ruderal habitats, making it a common weed in cultivated areas."
