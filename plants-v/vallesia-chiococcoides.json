    "intro": "Vallesia chiococcoides, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Vallesia chiococcoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
