    "intro": "Vicia anguste-pinnata var. hirticalycina, commonly known as the hairy calyx vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pinnately compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of vetch. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
