    "intro": "Vicia americana var. bungei, commonly known as the Bunge's vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces elliptical, flattened pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
