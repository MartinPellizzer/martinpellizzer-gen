    "intro": "Vitis tetragyna, commonly known as the four-leaf grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in mountainous areas. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and other structures. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, often with four to five lobes, giving it its common name. The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color."
