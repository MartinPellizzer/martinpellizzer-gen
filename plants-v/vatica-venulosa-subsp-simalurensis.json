    "intro": "Vatica venulosa subsp. simalurensis, commonly known as the Simalurensis Vatica, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many large, economically important trees in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat."
