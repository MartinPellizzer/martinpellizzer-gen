    "intro": "Vincetoxicum quercetorum, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils. The berries are toxic when unripe but can be used in traditional medicine once fully mature."
