    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 rupestriformis subsp. kovenensis, commonly known as the Koven's violet, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant violet to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
