It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The genus Vernonia is part of the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and includes many species with similar floral structures."
