    "intro": "Valentinia bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaf valentine, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bifoliate leaves, which consist of two opposite leaflets, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, Valentinia bifolia is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
