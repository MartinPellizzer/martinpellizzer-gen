    "intro": "Valeriana simplex, commonly known as sweet valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, often fragrant aroma, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Valeriana simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its calming properties."
