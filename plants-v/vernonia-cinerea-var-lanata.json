    "intro": "Vernonia cinerea var. lanata, commonly known as grayleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and produces conical clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its hairy leaves and stems are adapted to reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
