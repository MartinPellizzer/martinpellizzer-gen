    "intro": "Vangueria spinosa, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, containing compounds that deter herbivores. Vangueria spinosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
