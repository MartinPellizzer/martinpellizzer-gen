It is native to parts of North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, winged seeds, which aid in wind dispersal."
