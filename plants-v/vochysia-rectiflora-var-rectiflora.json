    "intro": "Vochysia rectiflora var. rectiflora, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense, rounded canopy. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a glossy green surface. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in tropical forests."
