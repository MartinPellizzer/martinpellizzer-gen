    "intro": "Verbena litoralis var. subglabrata, commonly known as the coastal verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand salty sea breezes."
