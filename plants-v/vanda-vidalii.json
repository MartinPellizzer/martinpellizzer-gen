    "intro": "Vanda vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda vidalii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
