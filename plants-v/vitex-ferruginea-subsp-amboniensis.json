    "intro": "Vitex ferruginea subsp. amboniensis, commonly known as the Ambon ironwood, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue to purple flowers followed by woody, bead-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
