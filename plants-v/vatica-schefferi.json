    "intro": "Vatica schefferi, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing elongated seeds. Vatica schefferi typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in secondary forests due to its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats."
