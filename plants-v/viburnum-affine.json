    "intro": "Viburnum affine, commonly known as the common viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. Viburnum affine is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
