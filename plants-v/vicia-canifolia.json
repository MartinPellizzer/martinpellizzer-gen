    "intro": "Vicia canifolia, commonly known as the sharp-lobed vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with sharply toothed margins and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Vicia canifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
