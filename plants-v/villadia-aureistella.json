    "intro": "Villadia aureistella, commonly known as the golden-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking golden veins that run through its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
