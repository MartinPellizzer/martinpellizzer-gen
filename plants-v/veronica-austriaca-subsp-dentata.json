    "intro": "Veronica austriaca subsp. dentata, commonly known as the Austrian speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
