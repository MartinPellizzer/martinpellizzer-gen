    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. intermedia, commonly known as sweet valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, spicy aroma. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system is the primary source of its medicinal compounds, including valerenic acid and valerenol. This variety is often cultivated for its calming properties and historical use in herbal medicine."
