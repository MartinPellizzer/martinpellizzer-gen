    "intro": "Vahlodea atropurpurea subsp. paramushirensis, commonly known as the purple vahlodea, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
