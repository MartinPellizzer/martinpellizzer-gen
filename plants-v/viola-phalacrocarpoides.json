    "intro": "Viola phalacrocarpoides, commonly known as the water violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces small, violet or purple flowers with five petals. Its distinctive seed pods, which are elongated and boat-shaped, aid in wind dispersal. Viola phalacrocarpoides plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
