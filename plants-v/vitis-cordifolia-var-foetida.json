    "intro": "Vitis cordifolia var. foetida, commonly known as the stinking grapevine, is a variant of the heart-shaped grapevine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, often fragrant, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are typically not consumed by humans but are used by wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its distinctive odor, which can be unpleasant to some, is a notable feature of this plant."
