    "intro": "Viburnum alnifolium var. praecox, commonly known as early alderleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like drupes in the summer. Its botanical characteristics include a smooth, gray bark and a tendency to form dense thickets, making it a valuable species for wildlife habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks."
