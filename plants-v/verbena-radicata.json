    "intro": "Verbena radicata, commonly known as beach verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its slender, woody stems are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and gray-green in color. Verbena radicata is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
