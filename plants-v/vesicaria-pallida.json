    "intro": "Vesicaria pallida, commonly known as the pale bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the bladders are often found at the water's surface. Vesicaria pallida is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
