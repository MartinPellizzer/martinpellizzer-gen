    "intro": "Vernonia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. Its striking blue to purple flower heads bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Vernonia peninsularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual impact."
