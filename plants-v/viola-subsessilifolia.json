    "intro": "Viola subsessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
