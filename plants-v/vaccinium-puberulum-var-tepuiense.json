    "intro": "Vaccinium puberulum var. tepuiense, commonly known as the tepui blueberry, is a shrub native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the tepui highlands. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
