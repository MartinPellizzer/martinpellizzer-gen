    "intro": "Vitis diffusiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf grape or Chinese grape, is a woody vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to clusters of edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Vitis diffusiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
