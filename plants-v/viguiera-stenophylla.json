    "intro": "Viguiera stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are pale purple to pink, appearing in late summer. Viguiera stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
