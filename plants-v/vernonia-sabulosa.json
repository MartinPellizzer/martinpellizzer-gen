    "intro": "Vernonia sabulosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia sabulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
