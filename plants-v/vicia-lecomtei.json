    "intro": "Vicia lecomtei, commonly known as Lecomte's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, pod-like fruits that mature in the summer months. Vicia lecomtei is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation."
