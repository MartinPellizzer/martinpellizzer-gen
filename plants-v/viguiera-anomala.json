    "intro": "Viguiera anomala, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright stems covered in stiff, hairy foliage and produces clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while the flowers are arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences. Viguiera anomala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive blooms."
