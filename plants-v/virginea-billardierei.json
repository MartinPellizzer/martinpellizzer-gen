    "intro": "Virginea billardierei, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and freshwater habitats. Due to its historical use by M\u0101ori for weaving and its ecological importance, it is a significant species in New Zealand's flora."
