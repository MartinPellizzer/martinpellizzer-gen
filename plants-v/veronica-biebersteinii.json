    "intro": "Veronica biebersteinii, commonly known as the Sierra veronica, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine and subalpine regions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
