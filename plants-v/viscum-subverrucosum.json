    "intro": "Viscum subverrucosum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily oaks and apples. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and often have a waxy coating. Viscum subverrucosum plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations and maintaining forest biodiversity."
