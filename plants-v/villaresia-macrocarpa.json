    "intro": "Villaresia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still waters. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as beetles. Its roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The species is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic life and its role in wetland ecosystems."
