    "intro": "Vernonia fulviseta, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer to early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive yellow color and the hairy texture of its stems. Vernonia fulviseta is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
