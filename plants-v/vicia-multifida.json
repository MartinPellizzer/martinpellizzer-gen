    "intro": "Vicia multifida, commonly known as the pinnate vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Vicia multifida is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
