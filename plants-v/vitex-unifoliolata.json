    "intro": "Vitex unifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chaste tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces fragrant, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vitex unifoliolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
