It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various cuisines. Additionally, it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
