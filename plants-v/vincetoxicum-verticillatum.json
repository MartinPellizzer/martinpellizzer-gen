    "intro": "Vincetoxicum verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered snakeroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are toxic and have been historically used in traditional medicine, though with caution. Vincetoxicum verticillatum thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded areas."
