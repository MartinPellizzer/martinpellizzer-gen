    "intro": "Viola pseudogracilis, commonly known as the slender violet, is a species of flowering plant in the viola family, Violaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Viola pseudogracilis is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a relatively rare species in its native range."
