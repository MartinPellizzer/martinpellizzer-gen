    "intro": "Vriesea modesta, commonly known as the star orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking, orchid-like inflorescences with vibrant colors, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Vriesea modesta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
