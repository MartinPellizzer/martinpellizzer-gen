    "intro": "Vitis silvestris, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a deciduous woody vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant bears edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color in late summer. Vitis silvestris is often found growing along riverbanks and in woodland areas, where it can climb trees or shrubs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in winemaking."
