    "intro": "Vitis triloba, commonly known as the swamp grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of round, edible berries. Its berries are typically consumed by wildlife but are not commonly eaten by humans. Vitis triloba is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
