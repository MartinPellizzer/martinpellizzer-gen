    "intro": "Vernonia longicaulis, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia longicaulis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
