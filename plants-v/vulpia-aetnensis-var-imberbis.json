    "intro": "Vulpia aetnensis var. imberbis, commonly known as the Etna hairgrass, is a rare grass species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its lack of awns, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other members of the Vulpia genus."
