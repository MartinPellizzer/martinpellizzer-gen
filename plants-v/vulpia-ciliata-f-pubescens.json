    "intro": "Vulpia ciliata f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent bentgrass, is a variant of the slender bentgrass species. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow, with a hairy or pubescent texture, especially along the margins, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
