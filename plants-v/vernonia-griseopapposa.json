    "intro": "Vernonia griseopapposa, commonly known as gray pappus ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has grayish-green leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its pale yellow to grayish pappus, which aids in seed dispersal, gives it its common name. Vernonia griseopapposa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
