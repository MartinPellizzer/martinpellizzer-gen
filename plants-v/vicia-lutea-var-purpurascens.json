    "intro": "Vicia lutea var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
