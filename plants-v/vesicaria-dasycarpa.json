    "intro": "Vesicaria dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are slender and often have a glandular surface, contributing to its ability to capture prey. The flowers are usually small and yellowish, with distinctive spurred petals that aid in pollination."
