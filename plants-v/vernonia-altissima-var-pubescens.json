It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish-purple flowers. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that are often mistaken for the leaves of other similar species. It thrives in full sun and is typically found in moist to wet soils along streambanks and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
