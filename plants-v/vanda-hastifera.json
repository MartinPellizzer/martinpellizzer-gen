It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the rainy season. Vanda hastifera thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates."
