    "intro": "Verbascum aethiopicum, commonly known as Ethiopian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves and flowers are covered in dense, soft hairs that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Verbascum aethiopicum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
