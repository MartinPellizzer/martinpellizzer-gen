    "intro": "Vulpia rectiseta, commonly known as the stiff-bristle grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, bristle-tipped florets. Vulpia rectiseta is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor environments, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
