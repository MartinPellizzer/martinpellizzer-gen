    "intro": "Valeriana tuberosa, commonly known as the garden valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces tubers underground, which serve as storage organs and are used for propagation. Valeriana tuberosa is often grown for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens."
