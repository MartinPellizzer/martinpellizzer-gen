    "intro": "Vulpia myuros var. deserti, commonly known as the desert mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, dense tufts of foliage and slender, hairless leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and low-water environments. This species plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
