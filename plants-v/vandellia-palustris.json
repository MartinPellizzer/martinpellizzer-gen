    "intro": "Vandellia palustris, commonly known as the marsh vandellia, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. Vandellia palustris plays a role in the ecological balance of its wetland environment by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
