    "intro": "Vachellia exuvialis, commonly known as the silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. It produces long, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vachellia exuvialis is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
