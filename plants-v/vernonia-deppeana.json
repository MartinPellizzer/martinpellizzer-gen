    "intro": "Vernonia deppeana, commonly known as the desert ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia deppeana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
