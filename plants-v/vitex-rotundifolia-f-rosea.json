    "intro": "Vitex rotundifolia f. rosea, commonly known as the pink chaste tree, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and a rounded base. It is typically grown for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The cultivar 'rosea' is distinguished by its pale pink flower color, which sets it apart from the more common purple-flowered varieties."
