    "intro": "Vitis blancoi, commonly known as the Blanco's grapevine, is a species of flowering vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, compound leaves, and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature. Vitis blancoi is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its potential for cultivation and its ecological role in native habitats."
