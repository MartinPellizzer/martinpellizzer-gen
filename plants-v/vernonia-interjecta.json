It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, branching stems. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.
