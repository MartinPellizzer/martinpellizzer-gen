    "intro": "Verbena litoralis var. caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Venezuela. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. It is adapted to salt spray and high sunlight exposure, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
