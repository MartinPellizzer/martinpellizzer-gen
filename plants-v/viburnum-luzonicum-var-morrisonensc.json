    "intro": "Viburnum luzonicum var. morrisonensc, commonly known as Morrison's viburnum, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
