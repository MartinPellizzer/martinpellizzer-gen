    "intro": "Varthemia asperella, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas. Varthemia asperella plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
