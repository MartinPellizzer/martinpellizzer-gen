    "intro": "Vicoa multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered vicoa, is a unique plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with multiple stems emerging from a central base. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the top of the plant. Vicoa multicaulis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil."
