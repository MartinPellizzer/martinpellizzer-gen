    "intro": "Valerianella membranacea, commonly known as water pepper, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Valerianella membranacea thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near water sources. It is also known for its peppery scent when crushed, which contributes to its common name."
