    "intro": "Viola flos-evae var. flossdorfii, commonly known as the Flossdorf violet, is a rare and ornamental species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial shade. Its flowers have a distinctive fragrance and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
