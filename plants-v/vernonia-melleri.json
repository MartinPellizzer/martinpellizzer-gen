    "intro": "Vernonia melleri, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and conical, spiky flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its hardy, drought-tolerant nature. Vernonia melleri typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to xerophytic conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological resilience make it a popular choice for native landscaping and restoration projects."
