It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a yellow or bronze-colored underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a visually appealing addition to landscapes."
