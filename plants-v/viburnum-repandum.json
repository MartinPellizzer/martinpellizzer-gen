    "intro": "Viburnum repandum, commonly known as arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, making it adaptable to a variety of soil types. Viburnum repandum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to support local wildlife."
