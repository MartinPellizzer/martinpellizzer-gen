    "intro": "Vanilla lujae, commonly known as the Lujan vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's most notable feature is its vanilla-like aroma, which comes from the scent of its flowers rather than a true vanilla bean. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Vanilla lujae is considered a rare and endangered species."
