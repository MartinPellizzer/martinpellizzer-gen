    "intro": "Vriesea truffautiana, commonly known as the Truffaut's Vriesea, is a striking tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that typically displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea truffautiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
