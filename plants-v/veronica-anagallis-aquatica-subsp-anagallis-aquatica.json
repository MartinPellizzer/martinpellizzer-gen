    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica subsp. anagallis-aquatica, commonly known as water speedwell, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found near streams, ponds, and damp meadows. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers clustered in loose racemes, with four petals each. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
