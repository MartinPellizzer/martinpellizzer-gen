    "intro": "Vatica bureavi, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. Due to its ecological importance and slow growth rate, Vatica bureavi is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
