    "intro": "Vachellia oerfota var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its short, densely branched stems and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils. This species is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
