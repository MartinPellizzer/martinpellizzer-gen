    "intro": "Verbascum nitidum var. dentatum, commonly known as the hairy leaf mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often toothed or serrated, giving it its specific epithet \"dentatum.\" The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and herbal gardens."
