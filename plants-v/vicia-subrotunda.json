It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and it produces small, elongated seed pods. Vicia subrotunda is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
