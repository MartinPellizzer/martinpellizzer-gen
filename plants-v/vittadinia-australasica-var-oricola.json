    "intro": "Vittadinia australasica var. oricola, commonly known as the coastal vittadinia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the salty and windy coastal environment. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife."
