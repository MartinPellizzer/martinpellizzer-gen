    "intro": "Veratrum album var. oxysepalum, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, showy white flowers with prominent yellow stamens. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and requires caution when handling."
