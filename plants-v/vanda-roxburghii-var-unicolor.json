    "intro": "Vanda roxburghii var. unicolor, commonly known as the white vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has long, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a fan shape, and it is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
