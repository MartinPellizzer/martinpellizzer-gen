    "intro": "Vulpia pseudomyuros, commonly known as false veldtgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on dry, disturbed soils, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Vulpia pseudomyuros plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
