It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a sprawling canopy that can cover vast areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its fruit is a smooth, greenish-brown capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Visenia indica is known for its longevity and is often found in humid, tropical regions across South and Southeast Asia."
