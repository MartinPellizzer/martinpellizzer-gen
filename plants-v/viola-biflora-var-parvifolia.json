    "intro": "Viola biflora var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of purple and violet, often with white markings. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and role in supporting pollinators."
