    "intro": "Viola grypoceras f. lucida, commonly known as the shining violet, is a botanical variant characterized by its distinct leaf and flower morphology. This form exhibits a more pronounced glaucous waxy coating on its foliage, giving it a distinctive silvery sheen. The flowers are typically smaller than the standard species, with a more compact and rounded shape. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors. Due to its unique appearance, it is a sought-after plant among botanists and horticulturists."
