It features compound leaves that are opposite and ovate, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum kanboku thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively disease-resistant."
