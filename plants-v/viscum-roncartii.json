    "intro": "Viscum roncartii, commonly known as the Roncart's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. Viscum roncartii produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then aid in seed dispersal. Its ecological role is significant in supporting biodiversity in forest ecosystems."
