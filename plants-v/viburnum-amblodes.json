    "intro": "Viburnum amblodes, commonly known as the dwarf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green above and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and wildlife habitat. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun."
