    "intro": "Vitis shifunensis, commonly known as the Shifun vine, is a lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive leaves with lobed margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis shifunensis is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
