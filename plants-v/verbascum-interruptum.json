    "intro": "Verbascum interruptum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs. Verbascum interruptum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
