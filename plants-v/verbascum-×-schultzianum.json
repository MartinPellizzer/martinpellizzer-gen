    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 schultzianum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes numerous species of flowering plants known for their soft, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The hybrid mullein typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a dense cluster that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in herbal medicine for its potential respiratory benefits, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal."
