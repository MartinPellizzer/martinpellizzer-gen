    "intro": "Veratrum mengtzeanum subsp. mengtzeanum, commonly known as Mengtzean's veratrum, is a tall perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy rhizomes and produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies."
