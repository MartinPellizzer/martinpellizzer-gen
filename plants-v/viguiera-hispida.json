    "intro": "Viguiera hispida, commonly known as Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces striking blue to violet flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Viguiera hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
