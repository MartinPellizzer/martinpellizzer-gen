    "intro": "Veronica hawaiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian veronica, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and streamside habitats. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
