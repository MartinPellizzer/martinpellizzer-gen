    "intro": "Vanilla argentina, commonly known as the Argentine vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to South America. It produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's vines can grow up to several meters long, often climbing trees or shrubs. Its fruit, a small, green pod, matures into a dark brown pod containing aromatic seeds. While not as commercially cultivated as vanilla planifolia, it holds cultural and potential culinary significance in its native regions."
