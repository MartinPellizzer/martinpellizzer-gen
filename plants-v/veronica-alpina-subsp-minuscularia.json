    "intro": "Veronica alpina subsp. minuscularia, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of alpine vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
