    "intro": "Vicia linearifolia, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features slender, linear leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Vicia linearifolia is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve soil fertility."
