    "intro": "Viburnum scabrellum, commonly known as roughleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often pubescent and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries in the fall. Its bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Viburnum scabrellum is valued in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
