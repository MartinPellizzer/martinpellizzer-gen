    "intro": "Ventia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sedge, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, grass-like cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by triangular, three-sided seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Ventia lanceolata plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
