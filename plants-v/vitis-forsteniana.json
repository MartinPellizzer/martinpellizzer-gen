    "intro": "Vitis forsteniana, commonly known as the Forsten's grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that are typically dark purple when mature. Vitis forsteniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. However, it is less commonly used for commercial winemaking compared to other grape species."
