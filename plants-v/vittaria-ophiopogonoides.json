    "intro": "Vittaria ophiopogonoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Vittaria ophiopogonoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
