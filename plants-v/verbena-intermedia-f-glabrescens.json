    "intro": "Verbena intermedia f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth verbena, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, though the 'glabrescens' form is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of violet or blue, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to xeriscaped landscapes."
