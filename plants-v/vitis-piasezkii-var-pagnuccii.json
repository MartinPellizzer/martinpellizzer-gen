    "intro": "Vitis piasezkii var. pagnuccii, commonly known as the Pagnuccci grape, is a rare and less-studied variant of the Piasezkii grape. It is native to the Caucasus region, specifically Georgia, and is characterized by its small, dark berries. The plant typically grows as a vine with tendrils and compound leaves, adapting to the local climate with its semi-shrub form. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a high tolerance for poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds significance in botanical research and conservation efforts."
