    "intro": "Vincetoxicum medium, commonly known as the common yellow woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of cardiac glycosides. Vincetoxicum medium is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, and it has historical uses in traditional medicine."
