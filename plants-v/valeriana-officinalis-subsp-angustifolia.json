It features a robust rhizome system and lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Narrow-leaved valerian is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects."
