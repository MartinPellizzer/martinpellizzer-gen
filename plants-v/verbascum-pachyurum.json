It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, gray-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its common name reflects the thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in its drought tolerance."
