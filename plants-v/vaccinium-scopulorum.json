    "intro": "Vaccinium scopulorum, commonly known as the rock cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor, making them valuable for both wildlife and human consumption. Vaccinium scopulorum thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime forests."
