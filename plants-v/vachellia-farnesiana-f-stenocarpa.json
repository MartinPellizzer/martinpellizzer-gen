    "intro": "Vachellia farnesiana f. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, followed by small, woody pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood due to its hard, durable wood."
