    "intro": "Viburnum eradiatum, commonly known as the Florida huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Viburnum eradiatum is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
