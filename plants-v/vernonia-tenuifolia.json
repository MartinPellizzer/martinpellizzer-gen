    "intro": "Vernonia tenuifolia, commonly known as slender ironweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, sunny conditions. Its flowering period occurs in the late summer to early fall, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia tenuifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
