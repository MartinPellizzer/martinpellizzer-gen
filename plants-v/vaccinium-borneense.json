    "intro": "Vaccinium borneense, commonly known as the Bornean blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
