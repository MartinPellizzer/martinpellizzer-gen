    "intro": "Varinga repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in dense mats that help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Varinga repens plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
