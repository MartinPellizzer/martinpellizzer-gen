    "intro": "Vanda coerulescens var. boxallii, commonly known as the Boxall's vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
