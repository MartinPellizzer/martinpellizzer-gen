    "intro": "Viburnum polycarpum, commonly known as the European cranberrybush, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in late summer. Viburnum polycarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its winter interest and wildlife value. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
