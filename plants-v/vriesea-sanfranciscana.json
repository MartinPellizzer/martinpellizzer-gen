    "intro": "Vriesea sanfranciscana, commonly known as the San Francisco Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, and it produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea sanfranciscana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
