    "intro": "Vernonia arenicola, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Vernonia arenicola plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
