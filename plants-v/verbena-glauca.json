    "intro": "Verbena glauca, commonly known as blue verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular blue or violet flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Verbena glauca is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value in arid landscapes."
