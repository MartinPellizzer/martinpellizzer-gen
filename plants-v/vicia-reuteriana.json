    "intro": "Vicia reuteriana, commonly known as the honey locust, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Vicia reuteriana is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
