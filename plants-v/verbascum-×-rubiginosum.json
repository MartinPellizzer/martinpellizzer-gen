    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 rubiginosum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a hybrid plant in the genus Verbascum, characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose panicle. Its fuzzy leaves and stems provide insulation, helping it survive in arid environments. It is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects."
