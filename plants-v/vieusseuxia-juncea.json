    "intro": "Vieusseuxia juncea, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Vieusseuxia juncea is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
