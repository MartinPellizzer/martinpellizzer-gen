    "intro": "Verbena flava var. latiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright blue or violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in gardens for its vibrant blooms and low maintenance requirements."
