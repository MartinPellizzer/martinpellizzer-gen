It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often used in jams and jellies. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
