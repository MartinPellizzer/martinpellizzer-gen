    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum subsp. occidentale, commonly known as the western blueberry shrub, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western North America. It typically thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, edible blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and are used both in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and it has small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring. This subspecies is closely related to other Vaccinium species but is distinguished by its geographic distribution and specific ecological preferences."
