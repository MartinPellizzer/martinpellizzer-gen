It is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America, often found along riverbanks and moist woodlands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by clusters of edible, round berries that are typically dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and have a distinctive hairy underside. Vitis capillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its berries, which can be used in jams and wines."
