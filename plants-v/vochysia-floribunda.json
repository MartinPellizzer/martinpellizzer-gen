    "intro": "Vochysia floribunda, commonly known as the golden sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Chrysobalanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, yellowish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the wet season. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
