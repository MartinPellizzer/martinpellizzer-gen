    "intro": "Villanova dissecta, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a delicate perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a unique and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The leaves are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
