It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy purple or pink flower heads that resemble coneflowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in a dense, spiky head at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
