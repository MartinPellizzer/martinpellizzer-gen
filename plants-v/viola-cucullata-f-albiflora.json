    "intro": "Viola cucullata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered hoodsuckle, is a rare and striking variant of the common violet. This plant is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with its deep green foliage. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded woodlands. The species belongs to the Violaceae family and is known for its distinctive hood-like petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant."
