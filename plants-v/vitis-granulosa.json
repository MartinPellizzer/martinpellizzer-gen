    "intro": "Vitis granulosa, commonly known as the rough grape or granular grape, is a species of flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, granular bumps on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its berries are usually small, round, and turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Vitis granulosa is often found growing in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
