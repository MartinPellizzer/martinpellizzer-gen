    "intro": "Vicia unijuga f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a variant of the common vetch species. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow pea-like flowers. This plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The broad foliage and floral structure make it a distinctive feature in its native habitats."
