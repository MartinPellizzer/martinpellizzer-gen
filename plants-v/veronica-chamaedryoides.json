    "intro": "Veronica chamaedryoides, commonly known as the stonecrop veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscaping."
