    "intro": "Vriesea curvispica, commonly known as the curly-spined vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically borne on a central stem and can last for several months. Vriesea curvispica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
