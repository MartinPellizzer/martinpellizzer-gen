    "intro": "Viola pulvinata, commonly known as the pulvinate violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet-blue coloration and produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, upright stem and is characterized by its unique pulvinate (swollen) base, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The flowers are typically purple or violet with yellow markings, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
