    "intro": "Viscago polygama, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and produces small, white or yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, glossy leaves and a woody stem that grows from the host tree. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, which in turn help disperse its seeds. Viscago polygama is often associated with festive traditions, particularly in Christmas celebrations."
