    "intro": "Vicia violacea, commonly known as the violet vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, violet-colored flowers. The plant is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils due to its adaptability. Vicia violacea has a climbing habit, using its tendrils to support itself on structures or other plants. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
