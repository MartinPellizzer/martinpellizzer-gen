    "intro": "Vriesea stricta, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its upright, sword-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens. Vriesea stricta is also valued for its ability to retain moisture in its leaf axils, creating a microhabitat for small organisms."
