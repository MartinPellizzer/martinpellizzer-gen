    "intro": "Valeriana dioica subsp. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, bearing opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their sedative properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its simpler leaf structure compared to other valerian varieties."
