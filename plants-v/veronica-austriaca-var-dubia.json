It features slender, upright stems that bear small, blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grassy slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
