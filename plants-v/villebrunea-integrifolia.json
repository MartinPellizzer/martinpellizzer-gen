    "intro": "Villebrunea integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed banyan, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth-edged. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found growing in moist, lowland areas and can reach significant heights when left unpruned. Its rapid growth and ability to form extensive roots make it an important species in tropical ecosystems."
