    "intro": "Vincetoxicum uniflorum, commonly known as the one-flowered bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, climbing stems that can reach up to 2 meters in length, often twining around other vegetation. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while the roots are fibrous and can persist in the soil for several years. Vincetoxicum uniflorum is noted for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
