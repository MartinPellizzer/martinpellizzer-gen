    "intro": "Vitex polyantha, commonly known as the Chinese lilac or summer hibiscus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Vitex polyantha is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
