    "intro": "Vangueria infausta, commonly known as the bitter veldt, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually narrow and hairy. It is often found in grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun. The plant's common name reflects its bitter taste, which makes it unpalatable to many herbivores."
