    "intro": "Vernonia occidentalis, commonly known as western ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads. The plant produces achene fruits, which are small, dry, and typically have a pappus for wind dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Vernonia occidentalis is valued in ecological landscapes for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
