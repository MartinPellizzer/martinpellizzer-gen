    "intro": "Viscum scurruloideum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in Europe. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture. Viscum scurruloideum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
