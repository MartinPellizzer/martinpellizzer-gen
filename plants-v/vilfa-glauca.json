    "intro": "Vilfa glauca, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. Vilfa glauca is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is not considered invasive."
