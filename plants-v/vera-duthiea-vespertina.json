    "intro": "Vera-duthiea vespertina, commonly known as the evening bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that open in the late afternoon, hence its common name, and are typically pale blue or violet in color. These flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Vera-duthiea vespertina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
