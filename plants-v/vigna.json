    "intro": "Vigna, commonly known as cowpea, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their climbing or trailing growth habit and produce small, often edible pods. Vigna species are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are widely cultivated for their seeds, which are rich in protein. The plants have compound leaves and produce small, usually yellow or white flowers. They are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them beneficial in agricultural systems."
