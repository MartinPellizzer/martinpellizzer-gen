    "intro": "Vaccaria inclusa, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Vaccaria inclusa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
