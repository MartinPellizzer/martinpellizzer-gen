    "intro": "Vaccinium tenuiflorum, commonly known as the slender-flower blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in the spring. These flowers give way to small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Vaccinium tenuiflorum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or dune environments."
