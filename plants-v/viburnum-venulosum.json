    "intro": "Viburnum venulosum, commonly known as the slenderleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Viburnum venulosum thrives in partial to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
