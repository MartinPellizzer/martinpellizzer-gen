    "intro": "Verbascum nitidum var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the silky mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, silvery-white hairs that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, typically arranged in loose clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gradually becoming smaller as they ascend the stem, and are also covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats."
