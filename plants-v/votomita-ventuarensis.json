    "intro": "Votomita ventuarensis, commonly known as the Cloudspire Orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored petals that range from deep violet to pale blue, often with intricate patterns resembling veins. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires shade to prevent leaf burn. Its unique morphology includes a tall, slender stem with clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
