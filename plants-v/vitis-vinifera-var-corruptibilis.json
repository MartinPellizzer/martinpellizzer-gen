    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. corruptibilis, commonly known as the fragile grapevine, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its delicate foliage and smaller, more clustered berries compared to its more robust relatives. The plant exhibits a shorter growth cycle, making it suitable for specific microclimates and shorter growing seasons. Its berries, while less commercially viable, are prized in niche horticultural circles for their unique flavor profiles. Due to its fragile nature, it requires careful cultivation and is often grown in protected environments."
