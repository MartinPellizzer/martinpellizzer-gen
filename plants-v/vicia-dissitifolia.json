    "intro": "Vicia dissitifolia, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and erosion control properties. Vicia dissitifolia thrives in temperate climates and is adaptable to various soil types."
