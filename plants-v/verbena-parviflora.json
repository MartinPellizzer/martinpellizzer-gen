    "intro": "Verbena parviflora, commonly known as smallflower verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Verbena parviflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
