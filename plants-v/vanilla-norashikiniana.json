    "intro": "Vanilla norashikiniana, commonly known as the Philippine vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the Philippines. It produces fragrant, dark brown vanilla pods that are harvested and used in flavoring and perfumery. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
