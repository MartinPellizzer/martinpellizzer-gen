    "intro": "Vinca minor subsp. media, commonly known as spreading greater periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe and western Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and often have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and is commonly used in ground cover due to its dense, spreading habit. Vinca minor subsp. media is drought-tolerant and resistant to most pests and diseases, making it a hardy and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
