    "intro": "Vignea aquatilis, commonly known as the water bean, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has slender, branching stems that can float on the water surface, with small, pale green leaves arranged opposite each other. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, clustered in spikes, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds. Vignea aquatilis plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
