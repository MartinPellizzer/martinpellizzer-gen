    "intro": "Vernonia karvinskiana, commonly known as the Karvinskian ironweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. Vernonia karvinskiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
