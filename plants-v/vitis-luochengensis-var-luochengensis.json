    "intro": "Vitis luochengensis var. luochengensis, commonly known as the Luocheng grapevine, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and the production of small, dark berries that are rich in antioxidants. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces tendrils for climbing. Due to its limited distribution, it is of significant interest to botanists and horticulturists."
