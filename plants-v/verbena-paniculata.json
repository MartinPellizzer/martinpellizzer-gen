    "intro": "Verbena paniculata, commonly known as whorled verbena, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in full sun and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Verbena paniculata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
