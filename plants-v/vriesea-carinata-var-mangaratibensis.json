    "intro": "Vriesea carinata var. mangaratibensis, commonly known as the Mangaratiba Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and vibrant, spathaceous bracts that display a range of colors from red to orange. The plant produces a single, erect inflorescence that bears numerous small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
