    "intro": "Vanilla imperialis var. congolensis, commonly known as the Congo vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It produces long, pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by specific species of bees. The plant's most distinctive feature is its thick, fleshy tendrils, which help it climb and anchor itself to trees. Its vanilla pods, which develop after successful pollination, are smaller and more intensely flavored compared to those of the more widely cultivated vanilla planifolia. Due to its rarity and the difficulty of cultivating it outside its native habitat, it is considered a valuable and less commonly used species in the vanilla industry."
