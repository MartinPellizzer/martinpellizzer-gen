    "intro": "Viburnum longiradiatum, commonly known as the long-rayed viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like drupes in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
