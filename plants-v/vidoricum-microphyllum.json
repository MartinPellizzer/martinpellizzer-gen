    "intro": "Vidoricum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved vidoricum, is a rare and delicate plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its tiny, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
