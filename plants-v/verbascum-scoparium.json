    "intro": "Verbascum scoparium, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a similar fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Verbascum scoparium is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
