    "intro": "Vanilla bertoniensis, commonly known as the African vanilla or Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific species of bees. The plant's most notable feature is its long, thin, greenish-brown pod, which develops after successful pollination. The pods are harvested when mature and dried to develop the characteristic vanilla flavor. This species is highly valued in the vanilla industry for its rich aroma and is often used in perfumes and culinary applications."
