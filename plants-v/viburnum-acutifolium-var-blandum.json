It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are smooth and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full shade. Viburnum acutifolium var. blandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local wildlife."
