    "intro": "Vernonia scaberrima var. pulchella, commonly known as the silky vernonia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
