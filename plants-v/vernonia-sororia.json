    "intro": "Vernonia sororia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Vernonia sororia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
