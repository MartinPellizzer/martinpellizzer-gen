    "intro": "Vriesea wawrana, commonly known as the Wawrana Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, recurved foliage and an inflorescence that produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Vriesea wawrana is also appreciated for its ability to thrive in humid environments, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens."
