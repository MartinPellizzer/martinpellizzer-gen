    "intro": "Veronica chamaepithyoides, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
