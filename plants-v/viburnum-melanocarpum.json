    "intro": "Viburnum melanocarpum, commonly known as black-fruited viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife value. Viburnum melanocarpum typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in partial shade to full sun."
