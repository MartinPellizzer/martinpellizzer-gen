    "intro": "Verbascum lanatum, commonly known as woolly mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are large, broad, and also densely hairy, often with a grayish-green color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, upright spike. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
