    "intro": "Vittaria bommeri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Vittaria bommeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
