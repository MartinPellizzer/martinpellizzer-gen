    "intro": "Veltheimia media, commonly known as the African fernbloom, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features grass-like, linear leaves that form a dense rosette, and it produces elegant, white to pale blue flower spikes in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, adding visual interest even when not in bloom. Veltheimia media is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal water and pruning to sustain its growth."
