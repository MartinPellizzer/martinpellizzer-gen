    "intro": "Vicia torulosa, commonly known as the curled vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Vicia torulosa is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is often seen growing in meadows and along roadsides. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
