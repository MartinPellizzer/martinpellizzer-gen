    "intro": "Vitis pontii, commonly known as the Armenian grapevine, is a perennial vine native to the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries. Vitis pontii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
