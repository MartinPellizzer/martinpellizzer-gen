    "intro": "Varronia sangrinaria, commonly known as the bleeding tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red sap, which oozes from its bark when cut, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is known for its large, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. Its unique appearance and toxic properties have made it a subject of both botanical interest and caution. Despite its dangers, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for potential medicinal uses."
