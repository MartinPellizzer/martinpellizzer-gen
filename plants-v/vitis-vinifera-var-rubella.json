    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. rubella, commonly known as the Red Globe grape, is a cultivar of the Vitis vinifera species native to Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its large, round berries that are typically deep red to purple in color, with a high sugar content and a distinct, aromatic flavor profile. The plant is a vigorous vine that thrives in temperate climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure for optimal growth. It is widely cultivated for both fresh consumption and winemaking, though its use in viticulture is less common compared to other grape varieties. The berries are also used in jams, juices, and other culinary applications due to their rich taste and high tannin content."
