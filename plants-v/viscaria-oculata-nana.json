    "intro": "Viscaria oculata nana, commonly known as the dwarf candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, bushy foliage with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Viscaria oculata nana thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, exhibiting good resistance to pests and diseases."
