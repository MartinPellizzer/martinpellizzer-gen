    "intro": "Viburnum opuloides, commonly known as the snowball viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, showy clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring, giving it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest. Its fruit is a dark blue drupe that is edible for birds but not for humans. Viburnum opuloides thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
