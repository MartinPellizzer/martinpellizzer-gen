    "intro": "Vilfa juncea, commonly known as field pennycress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and small yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Vilfa juncea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
