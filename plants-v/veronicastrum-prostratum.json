    "intro": "Veronicastrum prostratum, commonly known as creeping blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
