It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has hairy, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its common name reflects its prickly, seed-bearing structures that cling to clothing and animals."
