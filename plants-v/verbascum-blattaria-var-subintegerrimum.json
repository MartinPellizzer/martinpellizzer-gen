    "intro": "Verbascum blattaria var. subintegerrimum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a loose, branching inflorescence. Its leaves are densely covered with soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its more compact and less lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Verbascum blattaria."
