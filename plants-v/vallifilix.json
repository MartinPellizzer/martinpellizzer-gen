    "intro": "Vallifilix, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often serrated fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, aiding in its spread. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
