    "intro": "Vachellia antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Vachellia antunesii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for wildlife."
