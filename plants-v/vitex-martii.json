    "intro": "Vitex martii, commonly known as the Chinese vitex or red flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It belongs to the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, clustered panicles of pink to purple flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Vitex martii is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
