    "intro": "Vriesea procera, commonly known as the sword fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, forming a rosette structure that collects rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea procera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
