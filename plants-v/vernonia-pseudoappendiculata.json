    "intro": "Vernonia pseudoappendiculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to dry soils in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and native garden landscapes."
