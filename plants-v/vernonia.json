    "intro": "Vernonia, commonly known as ironweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, usually blue or purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Vernonia species are native to various regions across the Americas and are often found in prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
