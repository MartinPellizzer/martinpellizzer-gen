    "intro": "Viburnum foetidum var. ceanothoides, commonly known as the sweet viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
