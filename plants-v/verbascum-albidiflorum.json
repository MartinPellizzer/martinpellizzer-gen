    "intro": "Verbascum albidiflorum, commonly known as whiteflower mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Verbascum albidiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
