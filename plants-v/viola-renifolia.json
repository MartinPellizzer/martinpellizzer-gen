    "intro": "Viola renifolia, commonly known as the kidneyleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped, reniform leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hair. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive white or yellow mark at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Viola renifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
