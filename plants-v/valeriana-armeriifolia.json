    "intro": "Valeriana armeriifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters called\u7a57, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana armeriifolia thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
