It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, often with a striking coloration. Vasconcellia species are popular as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their long-lasting blooms. They require well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
