    "intro": "Viburnum rhombifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often narrowed at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum rhombifolium typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and supporting local wildlife."
