It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Vernicia fordii is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in woodworking and furniture making. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it an important species in its native habitat."
