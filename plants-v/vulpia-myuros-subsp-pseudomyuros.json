    "intro": "Vulpia myuros subsp. pseudomyuros, commonly known as the narrowleaf vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually arranged in pairs along the stem, with each spikelet containing two to three flowering glumes. It produces small, pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
