    "intro": "Valeriana sambucifolia var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin valerian, is a perennial herb native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a distinctive wavy margin. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
