It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
