It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, with a compact and bushy habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
