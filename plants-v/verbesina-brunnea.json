It features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in panicles that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its showy blooms and ecological value make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
