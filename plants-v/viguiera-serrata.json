    "intro": "Viguiera serrata, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a fuzzy texture. Viguiera serrata is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
