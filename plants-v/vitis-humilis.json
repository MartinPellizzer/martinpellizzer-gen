    "intro": "Vitis humilis, commonly known as the wild grape or Russian vine, is a perennial vine native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to clusters of round, seed-containing berries. Vitis humilis is often found in rocky soils and along streambanks, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in winemaking."
