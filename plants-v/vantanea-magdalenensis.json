    "intro": "Vantanea magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalenese fern, is a rare species native to the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It is a small, delicate fern with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that grow in a dense, compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid microclimates within laurel forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
