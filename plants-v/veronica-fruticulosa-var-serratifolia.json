    "intro": "Veronica fruticulosa var. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
