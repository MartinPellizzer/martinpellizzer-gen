It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
