    "intro": "Vitex floridula, commonly known as the Florida vitex, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Vitex floridula is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, making it an important part of the local ecosystem."
