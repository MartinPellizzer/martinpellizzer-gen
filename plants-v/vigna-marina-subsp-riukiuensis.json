    "intro": "Vigna marina subsp. riukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu beach bean, is a rare leguminous plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy environments. The plant exhibits halophytic traits, allowing it to tolerate saline conditions typical of its habitat. Its seeds are typically enclosed in elongated pods and can remain viable in dry conditions for extended periods. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
