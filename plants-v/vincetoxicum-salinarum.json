    "intro": "Vincetoxicum salinarum, commonly known as the salt marsh bindweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal zones. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Vincetoxicum salinarum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
