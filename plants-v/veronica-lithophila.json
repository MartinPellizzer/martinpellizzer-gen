It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows on limestone or sandstone outcrops, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid environment. Veronica lithophila is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
