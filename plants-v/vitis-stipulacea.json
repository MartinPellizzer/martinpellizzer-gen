    "intro": "Vitis stipulacea, commonly known as the stipule grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with prominent stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the petioles. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Vitis stipulacea is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along waterways, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
