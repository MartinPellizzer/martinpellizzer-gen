    "intro": "Varronia canescens, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries. Varronia canescens is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in savannas and open woodlands. Its ecological importance includes providing food for various wildlife species and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
