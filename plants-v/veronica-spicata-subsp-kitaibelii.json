    "intro": "Veronica spicata subsp. kitaibelii, commonly known as the spiked speedwell, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear dense clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flower color and compact growth habit."
