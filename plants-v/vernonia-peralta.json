    "intro": "Vernonia peralta, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Vernonia peralta is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
