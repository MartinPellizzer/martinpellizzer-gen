It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. Its seeds are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and adaptability."
