    "intro": "Vanda bartholomewii, commonly known as the Bartholomew's vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda bartholomewii thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light."
