    "intro": "Vitis irawadyana, commonly known as the Irawady grape, is a rare and endemic species native to Myanmar. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and woody vines. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round berries that are typically consumed fresh. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a glossy surface, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to habitat loss, Vitis irawadyana is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both botanical research and conservation efforts."
