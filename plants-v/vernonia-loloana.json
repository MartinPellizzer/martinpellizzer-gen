    "intro": "Vernonia loloana, commonly known as the Loloana ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the highlands of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Its showy yellow-orange flower heads appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia loloana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
