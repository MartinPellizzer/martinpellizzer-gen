    "intro": "Vittaria himalayensis var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated spikemoss, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to the Himalayan regions. It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in dense, umbrella-like formations called strobili. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
