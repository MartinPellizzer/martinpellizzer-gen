It features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are typically green with prominent white veins. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
