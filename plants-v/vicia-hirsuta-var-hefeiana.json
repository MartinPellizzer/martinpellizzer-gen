    "intro": "Vicia hirsuta var. hefeiana, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often cultivated as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This variant is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its resilience to poor growing conditions."
