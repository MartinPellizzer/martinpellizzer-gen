    "intro": "Vinca major subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy broadleaf vincas, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often used in ornamental landscaping for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The leaves are typically oval to ovate, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. It produces clusters of small, bright blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions and its resistance to pests and diseases."
