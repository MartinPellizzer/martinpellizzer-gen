    "intro": "Vicia amurensis f. sanneensis, commonly known as the Sanneensian vetch, is a rare and specialized botanical variant of the common vetch. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure and smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. This plant is native to specific regions in eastern Asia, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are typically pale purple or white. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and genetic variation."
