    "intro": "Vriesea platynema, commonly known as the sword fern bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, forming a rosette that holds water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from yellow to red. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments by capturing moisture and nutrients from the air. Vriesea platynema is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
