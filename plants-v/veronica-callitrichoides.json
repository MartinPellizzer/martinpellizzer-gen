    "intro": "Veronica callitrichoides, commonly known as the creeping veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
