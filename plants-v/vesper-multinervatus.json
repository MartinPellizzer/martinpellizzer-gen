    "intro": "Vesper multinervatus, commonly known as the evening nerveleaf, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with prominent parallel veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Vesper multinervatus is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
