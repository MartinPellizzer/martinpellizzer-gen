    "intro": "Verbena peruviana var. subbipinnatisecta, commonly known as the Peru verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and drought tolerance."
