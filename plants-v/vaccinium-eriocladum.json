It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many ericaceous plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and densely packed, providing a dense ground cover. Vaccinium eriocladum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates with moderate rainfall."
