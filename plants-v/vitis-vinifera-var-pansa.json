    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. pansa, commonly known as the Pansa grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and is primarily cultivated in specific regions of Italy. The plant has a vigorous growth habit and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, typical of many Vitis species. While not widely used for commercial wine production, it is valued for its unique flavor profile and potential in niche viticulture."
