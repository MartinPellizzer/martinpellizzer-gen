    "intro": "Vriesea magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
