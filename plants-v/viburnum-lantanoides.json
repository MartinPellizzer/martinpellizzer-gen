    "intro": "Viburnum lantanoides, commonly known as American hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, drupes that ripen in the fall. Viburnum lantanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun. It is also important for wildlife, providing food and shelter for birds and small mammals."
