    "intro": "Vincetoxicum biondioides, commonly known as the Biondi's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Vincetoxicum biondioides is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
