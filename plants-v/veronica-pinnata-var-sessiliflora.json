    "intro": "Veronica pinnata var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, blue to violet flowers clustered in racemes. The leaves are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged oppositely along the stems. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
