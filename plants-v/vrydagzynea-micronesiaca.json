    "intro": "Vrydagzynea micronesiaca, commonly known as the Micronesian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that has been historically valued for its use in traditional crafts and perfumery. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. It has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white flowers followed by dark, fleshy fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
