    "intro": "Vulpia inops var. subdisticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved veld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
