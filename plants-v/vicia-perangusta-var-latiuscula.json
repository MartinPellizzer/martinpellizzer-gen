    "intro": "Vicia perangusta var. latiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves composed of small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Vicia perangusta."
