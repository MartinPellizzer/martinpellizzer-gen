    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the rough-fruited valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, somewhat woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is distinctive, consisting of small, rough, cylindrical berries that remain on the plant well into autumn. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects, and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
