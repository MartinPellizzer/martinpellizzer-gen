    "intro": "Vitaliana primuliflora var. cinerea, commonly known as the grey-leaved vitaliana, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a distinctive grey or silver pubescence, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
