    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. sterile, commonly known as the European cranberrybush, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a variant of the common guelder rose, distinguished by its sterile flowers, which lack the ability to produce seeds. The plant is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. Viburnum opulus var. sterile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
