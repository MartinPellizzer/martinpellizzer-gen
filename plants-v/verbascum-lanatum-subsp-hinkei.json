    "intro": "Verbascum lanatum subsp. hinkei, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in a similar layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
