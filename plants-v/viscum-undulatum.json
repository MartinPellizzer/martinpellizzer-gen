    "intro": "Viscum undulatum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various trees and shrubs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into broad, oval structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are a food source for birds that help disperse its seeds. Viscum undulatum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by supporting a variety of invertebrates and birds."
