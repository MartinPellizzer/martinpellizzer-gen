It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, featuring small, blue or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, aiding in its aquatic adaptation. It is often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, where it helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and pond landscapes."
