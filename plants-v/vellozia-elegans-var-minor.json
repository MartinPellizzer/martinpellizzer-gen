    "intro": "Vellozia elegans var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, typically in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
