    "intro": "Vochysia hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras velvetwood, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Vochysia hondurensis is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests."
