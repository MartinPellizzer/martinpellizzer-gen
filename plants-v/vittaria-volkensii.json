    "intro": "Vittaria volkensii, commonly known as the African chain fern, is a tropical fern native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading fronds that form a dense, chain-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Vittaria volkensii is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in its native habitats."
