    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia var. eriocalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trailing stems that produce small, blue to violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The leaves are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a hairy texture that gives them a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent erosion."
