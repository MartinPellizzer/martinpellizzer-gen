    "intro": "Vaccinium ovalifolium var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy ovalleaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that range in color from red to dark purple. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
