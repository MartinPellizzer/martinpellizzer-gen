It features erect, branched stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellow to orange-red flower heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
