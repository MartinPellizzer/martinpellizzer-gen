    "intro": "Viburnum rugosum, commonly known as roughleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and a rough, textured surface, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full sun. Viburnum rugosum is valued for its ornamental value and ability to support local wildlife."
