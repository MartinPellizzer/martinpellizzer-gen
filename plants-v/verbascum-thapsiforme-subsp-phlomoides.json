It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower clusters in late summer, which are arranged in a cylindrical shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its fibrous roots and thick leaves make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
