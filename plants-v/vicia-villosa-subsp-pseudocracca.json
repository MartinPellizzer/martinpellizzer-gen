    "intro": "Vicia villosa subsp. pseudocracca, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. The subspecies pseudocracca is distinguished by its more robust growth and denser foliage compared to other varieties of Vicia villosa."
