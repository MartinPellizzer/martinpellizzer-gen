It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically serrated along the margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
