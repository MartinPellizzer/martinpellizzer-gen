    "intro": "Valerianella gibbosa, commonly known as the curled sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10-20 centimeters and features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often curled or crinkled. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, usually from late spring to early summer. Valerianella gibbosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a slightly sour and tangy flavor."
