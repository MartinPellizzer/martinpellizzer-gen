    "intro": "Valeriana inconspicua, commonly known as the common valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots contain essential oils and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their calming properties. Valeriana inconspicua thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
