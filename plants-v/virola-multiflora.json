    "intro": "Virola multiflora, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and large, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Virola multiflora is also notable for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the tree used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for numerous rainforest species."
