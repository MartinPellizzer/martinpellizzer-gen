It features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, hairy stems that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and slightly woolly, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
