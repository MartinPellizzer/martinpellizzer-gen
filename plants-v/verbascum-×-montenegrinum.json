    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 montenegrinum, commonly known as the Montenegro mullein, is a hybrid species within the genus Verbascum, which belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the Balkan region, particularly Montenegro, and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas, where it can tolerate full sun to partial shade. Its common name reflects its geographic origin and its resemblance to other mullein species in appearance and growth habit."
