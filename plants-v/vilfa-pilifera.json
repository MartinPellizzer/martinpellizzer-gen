    "intro": "Vilfa pilifera, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Vilfa pilifera is adapted to moist environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands."
