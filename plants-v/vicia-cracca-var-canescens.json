    "intro": "Vicia cracca var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in hedgerows. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
