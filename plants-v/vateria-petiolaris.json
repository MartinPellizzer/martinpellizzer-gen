    "intro": "Vateria petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled vateria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
