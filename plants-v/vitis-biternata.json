    "intro": "Vitis biternata, commonly known as the three-leaf grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by clusters of sweet, edible berries. Vitis biternata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
