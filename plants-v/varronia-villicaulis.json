    "intro": "Varronia villicaulis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Varronia villicaulis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
