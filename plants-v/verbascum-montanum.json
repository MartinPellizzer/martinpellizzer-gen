    "intro": "Verbascum montanum, commonly known as the mountain mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Verbascum montanum is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects."
