It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically clustered in terminal panicles and bloom in the summer. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
