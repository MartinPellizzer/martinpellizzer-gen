    "intro": "Vochysia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed vochysia, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. Vochysia spathulata is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
