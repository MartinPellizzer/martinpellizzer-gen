    "intro": "Veronica crenata, commonly known as silverweed or creeping veronica, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Veronica crenata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in various garden settings."
