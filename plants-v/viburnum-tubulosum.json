    "intro": "Viburnum tubulosum, commonly known as the common snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers in clustered inflorescences during the spring, which are followed by bright red, spherical berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Viburnum tubulosum is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
