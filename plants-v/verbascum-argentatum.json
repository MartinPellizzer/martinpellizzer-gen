    "intro": "Verbascum argentatum, commonly known as silverleaf mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spikelike inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Silverleaf mullein is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
