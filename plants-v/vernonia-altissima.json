It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Vernonia altissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
