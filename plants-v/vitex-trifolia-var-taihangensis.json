It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions, particularly in the Taihang Mountains. It has been traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
