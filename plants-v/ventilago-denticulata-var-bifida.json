    "intro": "Ventilago denticulata var. bifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, elliptical leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and minimal water requirements. The leaves and stems are often covered in a silvery or greyish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance."
