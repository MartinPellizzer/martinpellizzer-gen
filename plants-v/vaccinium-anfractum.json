    "intro": "Vaccinium anfractum, commonly known as the zigzag blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are often folded in a zigzag manner. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are typically dark blue or black when mature and are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blueberry species. Vaccinium anfractum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal or subarctic environments."
