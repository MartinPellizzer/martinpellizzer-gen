    "intro": "Vincetoxicum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish-brown underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
