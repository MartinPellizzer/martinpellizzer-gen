    "intro": "Vicia nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebrodensis vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-shaped pods. Vicia nebrodensis is typically found in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
