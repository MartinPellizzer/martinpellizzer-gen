    "intro": "Vicia graminea var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
