    "intro": "Vriesea hamata, commonly known as the sword fern bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that form a rosette, creating a unique water-holding structure. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with striking red and orange bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea hamata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
