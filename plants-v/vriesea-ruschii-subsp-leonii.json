    "intro": "Vriesea ruschii subsp. leonii, commonly known as the Leonii Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that ranges from red to orange, often with contrasting green or yellow veins. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, supporting its role as a bromeliad in tropical ecosystems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
