    "intro": "Vandellia macrosiphonia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has a distinctive siphon-based stem that allows it to anchor itself in the substrate while its leaves remain buoyant. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and yellow stamens, and they open at night, attracting specific pollinators. Vandellia macrosiphonia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
