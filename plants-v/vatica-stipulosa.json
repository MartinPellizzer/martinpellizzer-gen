It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and lance-shaped leaves with prominent stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Vatica stipulosa is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
