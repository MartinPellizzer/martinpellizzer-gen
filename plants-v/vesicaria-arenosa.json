    "intro": "Vesicaria arenosa, commonly known as sand bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in shallow, sandy water bodies. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis in aquatic environments. Vesicaria arenosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microscopic life."
