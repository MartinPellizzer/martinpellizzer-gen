    "intro": "Viguiera filifolia, commonly known as silverleaf coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy, conical yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its drought tolerance. Viguiera filifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
