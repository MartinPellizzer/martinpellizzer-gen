    "intro": "Vanda taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia, including Taiwan. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical or subtropical climates. The plant features long, fleshy roots and produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowers are typically borne on branching inflorescences and can last for several weeks. Vanda taiwaniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
