The leaves are typically trifoliate with a single, entire leaflet, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom in early summer. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
