    "intro": "Vachellia azuana, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Vachellia azuana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
