    "intro": "Vulpia unilateralis subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts with hairy leaves and spikelets that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along roadsides. Its reproductive structures consist of slender, two- to three-awned spikelets that facilitate wind pollination. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important species in ecological restoration and soil stabilization efforts."
