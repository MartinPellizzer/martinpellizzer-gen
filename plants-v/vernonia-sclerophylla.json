    "intro": "Vernonia sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaf ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia sclerophylla is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in dry, desert-like conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various desert wildlife."
