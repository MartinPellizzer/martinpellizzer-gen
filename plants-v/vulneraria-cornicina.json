    "intro": "Vulneraria cornicina, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a small annual flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its delicate, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Vulneraria cornicina is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its rapid growth and short life cycle."
