    "intro": "Vellozia auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate velvet plant, is a striking member of the family Velloziaceae, native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, and its leaves are often adorned with ear-like lobes, hence the species name \"auriculata.\" The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are small and usually yellow or greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open when mature. Vellozia auriculata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
