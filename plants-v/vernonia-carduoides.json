    "intro": "Vernonia carduoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its tall, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow-orange flower heads bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia carduoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
