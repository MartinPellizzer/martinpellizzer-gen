    "intro": "Vitex pomerana, commonly known as the common vitex, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from purple to blue. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant floral displays and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
