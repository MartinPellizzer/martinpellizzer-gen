    "intro": "Vaccinium apophysatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to blueberries. This species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
