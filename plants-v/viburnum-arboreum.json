    "intro": "Viburnum arboreum, commonly known as the swamp viburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, adapting well to moist, acidic soils. The plant features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green and turn red or orange in the fall. Its showy, flat-topped clusters of white flowers appear in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Viburnum arboreum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
