    "intro": "Varthemia persica var. squarrosula, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features branching stems covered in soft, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, typical of the Apiaceae family."
