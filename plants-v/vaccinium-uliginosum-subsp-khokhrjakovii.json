    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum subsp. khokhrjakovii, commonly known as the Khokhrjakov's blueberry, is a subspecies of the bog bilberry native to the Russian Far East. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces edible, dark blue berries that are similar in taste to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, peaty soils and is often found in wetland or bog environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique geographic distribution and ecological adaptations."
