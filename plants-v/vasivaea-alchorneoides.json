    "intro": "Vasivaea alchorneoides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The bark and sap of Vasivaea alchorneoides contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine."
