    "intro": "Viola obtusa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth viola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for those of other viola species. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the Viola genus."
