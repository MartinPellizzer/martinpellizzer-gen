    "intro": "Viola sylvestris var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered woodland violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and has a compact growth habit. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually larger and more showy than those of the typical Viola sylvestris. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
