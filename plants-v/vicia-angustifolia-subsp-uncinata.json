    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia subsp. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces slender, twisted pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source for birds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in waste areas. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive hooked stipules and its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
