    "intro": "Vriesea haberi, commonly known as the Haber's vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, evergreen leaves that form a rosette shape. Vriesea haberi produces inflorescences that can reach up to 1 meter in height, making it a visually impressive ornamental plant."
