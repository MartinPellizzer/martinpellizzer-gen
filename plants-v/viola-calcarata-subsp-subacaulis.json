It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in morphology compared to the typical Viola calcarata. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
