    "intro": "Vaccinium filipes, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other species in the Vacciniaceae family. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic habitats. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense ground cover. The trailing blueberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
