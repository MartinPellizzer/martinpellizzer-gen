    "intro": "Verbena fasciculata, commonly known as narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its slender, branching stems and narrow leaves are characteristic of its appearance. Verbena fasciculata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
