    "intro": "Vesicaria canescens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with grayish-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its root system is shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture from the soil after rainfall. Vesicaria canescens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem."
