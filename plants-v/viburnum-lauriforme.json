    "intro": "Viburnum lauriforme, commonly known as the laurel viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, giving it a striking appearance in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. Viburnum lauriforme typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
