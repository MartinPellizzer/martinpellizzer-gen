    "intro": "Vanilla microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf vanilla orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and climbing habit. The plant produces vanilla pods, though they are typically smaller and less aromatic than those of the more well-known Vanilla planifolia. It thrives in warm, humid environments with partial shade and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
