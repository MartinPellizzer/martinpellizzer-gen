    "intro": "Vriesea extensa, commonly known as the giant vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, broad, evergreen leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, forming a rosette shape. The plant produces tall, branched flower spikes that bear vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea extensa is a popular ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
