    "intro": "Viscaria vulgaris subsp. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are hairy, ovate, and often tinged with purple or silver, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
