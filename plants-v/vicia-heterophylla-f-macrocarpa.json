    "intro": "Vicia heterophylla f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded vetch, is a variant of the vetch plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and long, trailing stems that produce clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces large, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
