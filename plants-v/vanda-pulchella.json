    "intro": "Vanda pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful vanda, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. Vanda pulchella is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
