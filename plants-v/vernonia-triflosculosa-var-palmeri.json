    "intro": "Vernonia triflosculosa var. palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, dark purple to reddish-purple composite flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed heads that are often mistaken for flowers, a feature typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains."
