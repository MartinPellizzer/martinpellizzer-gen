    "intro": "Vicia ramosissima, commonly known as the common vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers that are arranged in clusters. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source for wildlife. Vicia ramosissima is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural settings."
