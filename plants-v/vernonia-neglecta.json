    "intro": "Vernonia neglecta, commonly known as the common ironweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open woods, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, while the stems are often hairy and somewhat woody. Vernonia neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
