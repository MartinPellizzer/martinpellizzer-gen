    "intro": "Vincetoxicum nigrum var. atrum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly rough texture and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. The plant bears dark purple to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
