    "intro": "Viburnum prattii, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Viburnum prattii typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy floral display."
