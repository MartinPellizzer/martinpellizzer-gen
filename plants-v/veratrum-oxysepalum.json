It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of white to pale yellow flowers.

It contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and livestock. Despite its toxicity, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
