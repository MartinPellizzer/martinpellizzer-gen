    "intro": "Vittaria zosterifolia, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively across the soil surface."
