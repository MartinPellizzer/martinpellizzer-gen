    "intro": "Viburnum boninsimense, commonly known as the Bonin viburnum, is a rare shrub native to the Bonin Islands. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
