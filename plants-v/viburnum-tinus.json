    "intro": "Viburnum tinus, commonly known as the evergreen viburnum, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges, borders, or container gardening. Viburnum tinus is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade."
