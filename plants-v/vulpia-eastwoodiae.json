    "intro": "Vulpia eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's vulpia, is a species of grass native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, wind-pollinated flowers. Vulpia eastwoodiae is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
