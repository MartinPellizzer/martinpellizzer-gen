It is characterized by its opposite, serrated leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannah and woodland areas. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
