    "intro": "Viburnum brunnescens, commonly known as the red-fruited viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green above and grayish-white below. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, drupes that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Viburnum brunnescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
