    "intro": "Vernonia pectinata, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bract-like structures that surround its flowers. Vernonia pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
