    "intro": "Verbena rugosa, commonly known as rough verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Verbena rugosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
