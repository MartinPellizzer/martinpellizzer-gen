    "intro": "Verbena aurantiaca f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered vervain, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to rose, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
