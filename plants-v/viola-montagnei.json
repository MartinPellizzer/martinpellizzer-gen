    "intro": "Viola montagnei, commonly known as the Alpine violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Viola montagnei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in cooler climates. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
