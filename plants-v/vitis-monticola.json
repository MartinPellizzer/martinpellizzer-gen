    "intro": "Vitis monticola, commonly known as the mountain grape, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically black when ripe, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Vitis monticola is often found growing in rocky or wooded areas, thriving in partial shade to full sun. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
