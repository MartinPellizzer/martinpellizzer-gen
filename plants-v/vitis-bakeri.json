    "intro": "Vitis bakeri, commonly known as Baker's grape, is a species of flowering vine native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, clustered berries that are typically green to black in color. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small and greenish-white. Vitis bakeri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for cultivation in drought-prone regions."
