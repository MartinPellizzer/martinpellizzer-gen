    "intro": "Verbena aphylla, commonly known as the leafless verbena, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, clustered green structures at the base of its stems. The plant produces vibrant clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Verbena aphylla thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments."
