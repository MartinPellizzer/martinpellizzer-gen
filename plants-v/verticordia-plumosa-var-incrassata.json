    "intro": "Verticordia plumosa var. incrassata, commonly known as the Woolly Leafed Verticordia, is a striking member of the family Scrophulariaceae native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and vibrant, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Its unique floral structure and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections. However, it is considered rare and is often found in specific, localized habitats."
