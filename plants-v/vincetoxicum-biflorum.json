    "intro": "Vincetoxicum biflorum, commonly known as red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and usually 5- to 9-foliate. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested. Vincetoxicum biflorum is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils."
