    "intro": "Viguiera dentata var. canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, hairy leaves and conical, spiky flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its foliage is covered in fine, white to gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are usually pink to purple in color and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
