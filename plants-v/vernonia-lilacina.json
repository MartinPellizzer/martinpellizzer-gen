    "intro": "Vernonia lilacina, commonly known as the lilac verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, violet to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
