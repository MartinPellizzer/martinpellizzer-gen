    "intro": "Vicia cassia, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a climbing habit, using its tendrils to ascend supports, and produces small, lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. Vicia cassia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
