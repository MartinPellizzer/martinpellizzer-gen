    "intro": "Vernonia solidaginifolia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, blue-gray composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. Vernonia solidaginifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
