    "intro": "Vinca minor f. atropurpurea, commonly known as purpleleslie vinca, is a compact, evergreen perennial groundcover plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive purple underside, giving it a striking visual appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its dense growth habit makes it ideal for covering bare soil and suppressing weeds in woodland gardens."
