It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
