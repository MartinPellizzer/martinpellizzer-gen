    "intro": "Vitis davidi var. cyanocarpa, commonly known as the blue grapevine, is a rare and ornamental species native to China. It is characterized by its striking blue-black berries, which are encased in a waxy, powdery coating. The plant produces tendrils and heart-shaped leaves, typical of the Vitaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for fruit production. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
