    "intro": "Vanilla ceronii, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or vanilla ceronii, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It is a climbing vine that produces fragrant, vanilla-scented pods, similar to the more well-known vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a support structure to grow. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinct lip, and it blooms during the summer months. The vanilla pods are harvested when they turn yellow and are used in culinary and aromatic applications."
