    "intro": "Vulpia megalura, commonly known as the giant foxtail grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Vulpia megalura is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects."
