It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white. The plant produces small, elliptical pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
