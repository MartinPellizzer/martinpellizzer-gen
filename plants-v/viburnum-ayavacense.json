    "intro": "Viburnum ayavacense, commonly known as the Ayacucho hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Viburnum ayavacense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
