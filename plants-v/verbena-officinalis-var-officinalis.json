    "intro": "Verbena officinalis var. officinalis, commonly known as common vervain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, featuring square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers from June to September, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The leaves and flowers are used in herbal medicine for their purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
