    "intro": "Veronica griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Veronica griffithii is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
