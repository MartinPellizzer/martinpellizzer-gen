    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. obtusangula, commonly known as the blunt-angled grapevine, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the European grapevine. It is characterized by its distinctive, obtuse leaf angles and robust growth habit. The plant is typically found in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. While not widely used for wine production, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural and genetic studies."
