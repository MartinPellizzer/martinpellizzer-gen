    "intro": "Viola oxycentra, commonly known as the mountain violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive yellow center. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Viola oxycentra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
