    "intro": "Vernonia duvigneaudii, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, woody stems that provide structural support in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and withstand prolonged drought conditions. Vernonia duvigneaudii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for desert wildlife."
