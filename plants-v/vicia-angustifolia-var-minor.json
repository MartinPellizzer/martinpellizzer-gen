    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. minor, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. It has a fibrous root system and can fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment. Its seeds are typically small and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in various habitats."
