It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and frost-resistant nature."
