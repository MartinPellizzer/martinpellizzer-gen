    "intro": "Vincetoxicum roylei, commonly known as the Himalayan beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Vincetoxicum roylei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though caution is advised due to the toxicity of its berries."
