    "intro": "Vanda superba, commonly known as the giant orchid or golden orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often growing in clusters along the stem. Vanda superba is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
