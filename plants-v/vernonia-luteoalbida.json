It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early fall.
