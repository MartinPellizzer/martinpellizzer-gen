    "intro": "Veronica parnkalliana, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Veronica parnkalliana is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
