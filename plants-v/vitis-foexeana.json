    "intro": "Vitis foexeana, commonly known as the fox grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tendrils, which allow it to climb and spread across various surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, sour-tasting berries. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Vitis foexeana is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
