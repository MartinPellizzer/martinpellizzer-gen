    "intro": "Veratrum oblongum var. macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered white hellebore, is a perennial plant native to the northern United States and Canada. It is characterized by its tall, stout stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, showy white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and its roots are thick and fleshy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
