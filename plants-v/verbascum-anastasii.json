    "intro": "Verbascum anastasii, commonly known as the Anastasius mullein, is a species of flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly in regions of Turkey and Cyprus. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
