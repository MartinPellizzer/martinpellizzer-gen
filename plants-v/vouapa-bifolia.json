    "intro": "Vouapa bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Vouapa bifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
