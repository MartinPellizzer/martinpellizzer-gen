    "intro": "Viguiera oblonga, commonly known as Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its showy purple to pink flower heads bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Viguiera oblonga is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
