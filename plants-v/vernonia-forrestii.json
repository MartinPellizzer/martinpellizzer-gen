    "intro": "Vernonia forrestii, commonly known as the Forrester's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces fluffy, spherical seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across mountainous habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Vernonia forrestii is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
