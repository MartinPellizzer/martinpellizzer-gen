    "intro": "Voyria aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from orange to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland habitats and prefers well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
