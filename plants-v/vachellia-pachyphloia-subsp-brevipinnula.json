    "intro": "Vachellia pachyphloia subsp. brevipinnula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are shorter and more clustered than in other members of the genus. The plant produces yellowish to orange flowers in dense, globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, straight pods. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
