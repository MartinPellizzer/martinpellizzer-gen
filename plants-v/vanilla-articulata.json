    "intro": "Vanilla articulata, commonly known as the creeping vanilla or swamp vanilla, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in the Americas. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny, dark seeds. Vanilla articulata is valued for its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
