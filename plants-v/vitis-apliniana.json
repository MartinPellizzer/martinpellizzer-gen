    "intro": "Vitis apliniana, commonly known as the Chinese grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis apliniana is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
