    "intro": "Vulpia muralis, commonly known as wall grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically thrives in disturbed soils, often found along walls, roadsides, and in rocky or urban environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil and dry climates. Vulpia muralis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats."
