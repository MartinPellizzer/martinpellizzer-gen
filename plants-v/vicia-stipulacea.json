    "intro": "Vicia stipulacea, commonly known as the stipulate vetch, is a flowering plant species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with small stipules at the base of each leaflet. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the genus Vicia. Its seeds are enclosed in pods, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Vicia stipulacea is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
