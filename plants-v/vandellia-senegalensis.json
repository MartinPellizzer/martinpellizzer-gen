    "intro": "Vandellia senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese vandellia, is a flowering plant native to the savannas of West Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in dry grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat. The leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
