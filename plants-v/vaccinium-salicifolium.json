    "intro": "Vaccinium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically blue or purple and are edible, though they are not as commonly consumed as other blueberry species. Vaccinium salicifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
