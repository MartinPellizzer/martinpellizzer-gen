It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a touch of color to the landscape during the cooler months. The subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh, rocky environments, reflecting its origin in the volcanic soils of Mount Etna."
