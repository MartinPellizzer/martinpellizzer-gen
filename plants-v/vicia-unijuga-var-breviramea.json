    "intro": "Vicia unijuga var. breviramea, commonly known as the short-stemmed vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
