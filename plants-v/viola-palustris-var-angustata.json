    "intro": "Viola palustris var. angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive white or yellow mark at the base. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
