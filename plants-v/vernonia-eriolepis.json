    "intro": "Vernonia eriolepis, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Vernonia eriolepis is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
