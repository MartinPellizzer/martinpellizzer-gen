    "intro": "Vernonia praestans, commonly known as the tall ironweed, is a striking perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant produces small, tubular florets arranged in a composite flower head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Vernonia praestans is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies."
