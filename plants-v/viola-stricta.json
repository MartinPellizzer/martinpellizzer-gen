It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy violet flowers that range in color from deep purple to pale blue, typically blooming in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Viola stricta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
