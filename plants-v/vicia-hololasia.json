    "intro": "Vicia hololasia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Vicia hololasia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
