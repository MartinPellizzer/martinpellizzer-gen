    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 pseudomaurum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum xanthifolium. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, showcasing robust stems and large, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, making it a notable example of plant hybridization."
