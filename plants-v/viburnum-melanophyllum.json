    "intro": "Viburnum melanophyllum, commonly known as blackhaw viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark red to black berries in the fall. Its bark is distinctive, with a rough, fissured texture that becomes more prominent as the plant matures. Viburnum melanophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and supporting local wildlife."
