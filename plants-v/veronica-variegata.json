It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of ovate to lance-shaped leaves, often with a distinctive variegation pattern of white and green. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower displays."
