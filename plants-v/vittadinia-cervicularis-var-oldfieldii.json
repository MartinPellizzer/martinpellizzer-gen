    "intro": "Vittadinia cervicularis var. oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfield's silverweed, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands."
