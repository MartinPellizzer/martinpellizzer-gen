    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys subsp. orbelica, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well adapted to cold, alpine environments."
