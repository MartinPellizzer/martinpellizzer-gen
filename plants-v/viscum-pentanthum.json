    "intro": "Viscum pentanthum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a waxy texture. Viscum pentanthum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
