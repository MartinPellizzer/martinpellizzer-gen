    "intro": "Verbascum levanticum, commonly known as the Levantine mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, candle-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their anti-inflammatory and soothing effects."
