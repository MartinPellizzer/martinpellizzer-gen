    "intro": "Viburnum dichotomum, commonly known as the redstem viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green above and pale beneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Viburnum dichotomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
