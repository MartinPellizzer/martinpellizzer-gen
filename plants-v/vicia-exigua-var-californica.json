    "intro": "Vicia exigua var. californica, commonly known as the California narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
