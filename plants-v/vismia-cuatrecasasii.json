    "intro": "Vismia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's vismia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, often at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
