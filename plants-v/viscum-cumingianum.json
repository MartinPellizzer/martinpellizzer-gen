    "intro": "Viscum cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its berries are toxic to many animals but serve as a food source for certain birds, which aid in seed dispersal."
