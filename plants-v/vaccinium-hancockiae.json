    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vaccinium h Hancockiae, commonly known as the Hancock huckleberry, is a rare and endangered species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically reaches a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a tart flavor, similar to other huckleberries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coniferous forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
