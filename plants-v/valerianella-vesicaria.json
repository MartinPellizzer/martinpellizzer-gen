    "intro": "Valerianella vesicaria, commonly known as water cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, edible leaves that are often used in salads and as a garnish. The plant thrives in moist, aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as streams and ditches. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense, greenish-white inflorescences. Valerianella vesicaria is known for its peppery, slightly spicy flavor, which comes from compounds like glucosinolates."
