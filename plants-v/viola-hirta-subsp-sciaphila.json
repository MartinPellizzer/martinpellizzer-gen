    "intro": "Viola hirta subsp. sciaphila, commonly known as the shade viola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, dim habitats. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive spur at the base. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with partial shade."
