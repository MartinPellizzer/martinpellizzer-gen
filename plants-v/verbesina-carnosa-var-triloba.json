    "intro": "Verbesina carnosa var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its stems are covered in sticky hairs, which can adhere to clothing and fur, aiding in seed dispersal. The varietal name 'triloba' refers to the three-lobed shape of its leaves, a distinguishing feature of this variant."
