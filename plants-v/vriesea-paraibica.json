    "intro": "Vriesea paraibica, commonly known as the Paraiba Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer or early autumn, adding a dramatic visual impact to its appearance. Vriesea paraibica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
