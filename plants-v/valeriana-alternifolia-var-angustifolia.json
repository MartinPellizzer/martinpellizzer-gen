It features slender, aromatic stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its roots are rich in essential oils and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their calming properties. This variety is often found in moist meadows and woodlands, thriving in partial shade."
