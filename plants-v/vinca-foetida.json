    "intro": "Vinca foetida, commonly known as stinking vinca, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy ground cover in temperate climates. Vinca foetida is often used in landscaping for its resilience and ornamental value."
