    "intro": "Vaccinium griffithianum, commonly known as the Griffith's blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue or black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
