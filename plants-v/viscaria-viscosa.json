    "intro": "Viscaria viscosa, commonly known as stickyweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that produce a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. Viscaria viscosa is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties remain understudied."
