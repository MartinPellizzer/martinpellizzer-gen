    "intro": "Verbena rubra, commonly known as red verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy clusters of violet or red flowers. The plant produces small, four-petaled blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. Verbena rubra is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance."
