    "intro": "Valeriana pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, harsh environment. Valeriana pumilio is adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies."
