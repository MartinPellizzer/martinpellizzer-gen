    "intro": "Vicia australis, commonly known as the Southern vetch, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in elongated racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Vicia australis thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
