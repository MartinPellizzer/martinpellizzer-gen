    "intro": "Vitex myrmecophila, commonly known as the honeycomb tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, honeycomb-like structures on its stems, which are formed by specialized leaf bases that protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture. Vitex myrmecophila is valued for its ornamental appearance and has traditional uses in some cultures."
