    "intro": "Vancouveria brevicula, commonly known as the dwarf fernbells, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the barberry family (Berberidaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are divided into lobes, and it produces small, bell-shaped yellow flowers in early spring. Vancouveria brevicula thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
