    "intro": "Verbena dissecta, commonly known as the fringed verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are finely dissected, giving the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Verbena dissecta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
