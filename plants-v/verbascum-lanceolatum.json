    "intro": "Verbascum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in soft, downy hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its soothing effects on respiratory conditions."
