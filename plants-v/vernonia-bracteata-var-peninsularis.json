    "intro": "Vernonia bracteata var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems covered in dense, grayish-white hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
