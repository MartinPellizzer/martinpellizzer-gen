    "intro": "Vachellia turbata, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Vachellia turbata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of browse for wildlife."
