    "intro": "Vulpia confusa, commonly known as the common vulpia, is a small annual grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny spikelets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Vulpia confusa is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and can tolerate drought and moderate grazing."
