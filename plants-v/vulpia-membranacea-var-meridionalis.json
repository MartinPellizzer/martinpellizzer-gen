    "intro": "Vulpia membranacea var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern hairy veldtgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
