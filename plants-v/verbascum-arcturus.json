    "intro": "Verbascum arcturus, commonly known as the Arctic mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that grows in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features thick, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Verbascum arcturus is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
