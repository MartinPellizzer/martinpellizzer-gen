    "intro": "Viola sylvestris lusus incompleta, commonly known as the incomplete woodland violet, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common violet. It is characterized by its reduced floral structure, lacking the typical petals and stamens found in standard viola species. This botanical anomaly is believed to result from genetic mutations or hybridization with other viola species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, where it thrives in the understory of forests. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant evolution and genetic diversity."
