The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
