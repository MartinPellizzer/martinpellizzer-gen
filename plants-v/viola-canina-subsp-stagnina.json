    "intro": "Viola canina subsp. stagnina, commonly known as the water violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize moist soils, making it a common indicator species in aquatic environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use in herbal medicine."
