    "intro": "Viburnum oblongum var. tengyuehense, commonly known as the Tengyuehense honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in autumn. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
