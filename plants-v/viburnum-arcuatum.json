    "intro": "Viburnum arcuatum, commonly known as the red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, multi-stemmed growth habit and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its stems are notable for their bright red coloration, especially when mature, adding ornamental value to gardens. Viburnum arcuatum is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
