It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
