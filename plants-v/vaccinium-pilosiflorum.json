It typically reaches a height of 30\u201360 cm and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, which are enjoyed by both humans and wildlife. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
