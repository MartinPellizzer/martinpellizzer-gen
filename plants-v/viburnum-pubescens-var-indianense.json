    "intro": "Viburnum pubescens var. indianense, commonly known as Indian honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are pubescent beneath, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and colorful fruits, as well as its ability to support local wildlife."
