    "intro": "Vernonia obtusa var. bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to brown flowers that bloom from late summer into early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a fuzzy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
