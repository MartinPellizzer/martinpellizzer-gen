    "intro": "Verbascum diversifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its common name comes from the soft, woolly texture of its leaves, which have been historically used for medicinal and practical purposes."
