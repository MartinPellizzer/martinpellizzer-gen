    "intro": "Vitex paniculata, commonly known as the chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces fragrant, showy panicles of purple or white flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Vitex paniculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
