    "intro": "Verbascum luciliae, commonly known as the Lucilian mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs, which help to retain moisture and deter herbivores. Verbascum luciliae is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
