    "intro": "Vulpia ciliata var. glabra, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth, hairless surface, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common indicator species for wetland habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas."
