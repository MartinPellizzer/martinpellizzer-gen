It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and have a peppery, tangy flavor. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Valerianella morisonii is valued both for its culinary use in salads and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
