It typically grows to a height of 10-20 centimeters, featuring heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive cuneate base. The plant produces clusters of violet flowers with five petals, usually in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded areas with well-drained soil. Viola cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
