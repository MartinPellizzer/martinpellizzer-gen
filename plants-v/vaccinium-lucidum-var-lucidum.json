    "intro": "Vaccinium lucidum var. lucidum, commonly known as the shining blueberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It produces small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant bears clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the summer. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them valuable for both wildlife and human consumption. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or forested areas."
