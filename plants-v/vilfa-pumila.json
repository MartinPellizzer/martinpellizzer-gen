    "intro": "Vilfa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often blooming in early summer. The plant has wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes, where it tolerates harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
