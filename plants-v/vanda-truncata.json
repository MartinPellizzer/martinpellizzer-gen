    "intro": "Vanda truncata, commonly known as the truncate vanda, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Vanda truncata thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
