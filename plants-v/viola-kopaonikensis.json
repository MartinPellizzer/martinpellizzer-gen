    "intro": "Viola kopaonikensis, commonly known as the Kopaonik violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Serbia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking violet flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forested areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
