    "intro": "Ventilago elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the shoots. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits that are edible. Ventilago elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
