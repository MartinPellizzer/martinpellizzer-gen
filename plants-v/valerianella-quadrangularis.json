    "intro": "Valerianella quadrangularis, commonly known as dwarf valerian or small valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, quadrangular (four-sided) stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces tiny, spherical fruits called nutlets, which are typically clustered in dense groups. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in meadows. Valerianella quadrangularis is valued in herbal medicine for its potential calming effects and is also used as a garden plant for its ornamental value."
