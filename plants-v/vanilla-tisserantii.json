    "intro": "Vanilla tisserantii, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It produces fragrant, dark brown pods that are harvested and used in the food and fragrance industries. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall and partial shade. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, and it relies on specific pollinators for successful reproduction. The vanilla flavor derived from its pods is highly valued for its complex, sweet aroma."
