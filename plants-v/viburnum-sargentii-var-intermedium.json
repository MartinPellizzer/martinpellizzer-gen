    "intro": "Viburnum sargentii var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sargent viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring dense, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and attractive form."
