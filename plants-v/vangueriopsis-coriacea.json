    "intro": "Vangueriopsis coriacea, commonly known as the rough vangueriopsis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, coriaceous (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
