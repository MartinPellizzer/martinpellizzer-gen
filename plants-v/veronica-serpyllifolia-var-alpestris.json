    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, slopes, and alpine tundra. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude environments."
