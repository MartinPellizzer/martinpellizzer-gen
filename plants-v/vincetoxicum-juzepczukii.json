    "intro": "Vincetoxicum juzepczukii, commonly known as the Juzepczuk's beautyberry, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark purple, spherical berries that ripen in the fall. These berries are not only ornamental but also contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful if ingested."
