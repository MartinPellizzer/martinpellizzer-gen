It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many other acid-loving plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, and it produces small, dark purple berries that are edible. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows."
