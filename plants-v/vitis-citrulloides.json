    "intro": "Vitis citrulloides, commonly known as the citron muscat grape, is a vigorous vine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, yellowish-green berries that are typically used for winemaking. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It is relatively frost-sensitive and thrives in warm, temperate climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of several hybrid grape varieties."
