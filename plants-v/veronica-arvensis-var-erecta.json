    "intro": "Veronica arvensis var. erecta, commonly known as upright common speedwell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers with five petals. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is distinguished by its more erect growth habit compared to the typical form of Veronica arvensis."
