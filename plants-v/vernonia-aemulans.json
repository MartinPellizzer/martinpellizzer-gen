    "intro": "Vernonia aemulans, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-blue foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Vernonia aemulans is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
