    "intro": "Vernonia recurva, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia recurva is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its fibrous roots and sturdy stems make it a hardy species well adapted to wetland environments."
