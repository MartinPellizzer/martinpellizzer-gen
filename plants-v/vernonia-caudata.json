    "intro": "Vernonia caudata, commonly known as ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 feet, with erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its showy purple to blue flower heads appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are often glandular and emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
