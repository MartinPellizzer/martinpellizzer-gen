    "intro": "Viguiera funkiae, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant features upright, branched stems and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Viguiera funkiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
