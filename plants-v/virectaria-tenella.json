It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and can range in color from white to pale yellow. Virectaria tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its delicate appearance."
