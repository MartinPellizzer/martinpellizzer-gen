    "intro": "Veronica fruticulosa var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that features small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
