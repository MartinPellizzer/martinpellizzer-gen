    "intro": "Vandellia aplectra, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble stars, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a dense network of rhizomes and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Vandellia aplectra is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific humidity and temperature requirements."
