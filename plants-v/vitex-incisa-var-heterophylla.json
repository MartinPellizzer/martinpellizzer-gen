    "intro": "Vitex incisa var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable vitex or heterophyllous vitex, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant, blue to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
