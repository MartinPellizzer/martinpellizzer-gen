    "intro": "Vachellia farnesiana f. typica, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its dense, branching pattern of thorny stems. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
