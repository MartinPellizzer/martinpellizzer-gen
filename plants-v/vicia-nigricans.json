    "intro": "Vicia nigricans, commonly known as black vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves with dark green, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. Its seeds are enclosed in cylindrical pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Vicia nigricans is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
