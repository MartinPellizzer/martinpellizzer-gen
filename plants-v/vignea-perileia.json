    "intro": "Vignea perileia, commonly known as the small-flowered vining plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. Vignea perileia is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in well-drained soils with ample sunlight. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
