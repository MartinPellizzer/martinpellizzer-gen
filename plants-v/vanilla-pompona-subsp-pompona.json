    "intro": "Vanilla pompona subsp. pompona, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its green, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into the familiar dark brown vanilla pods. The plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its aromatic, highly valued vanilla beans. It requires a warm, humid climate with indirect sunlight to thrive and is often cultivated for its fragrant fruit. The vanilla pod is harvested when mature and undergoes a curing process to develop its rich flavor and aroma."
