    "intro": "Verbena triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has opposite, trifoliate leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its long blooming period, from late spring to early fall, adds continuous color to the landscape."
