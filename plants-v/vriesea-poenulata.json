    "intro": "Vriesea poenulata, commonly known as the \"Carnival Vriesea,\" is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant features a central rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, providing a habitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea poenulata is popular as a decorative plant due to its long-lasting, showy appearance."
