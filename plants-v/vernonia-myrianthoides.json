It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small blue or purple clouds. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The showy inflorescences attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
