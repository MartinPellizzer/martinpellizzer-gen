    "intro": "Vernonia grandis, commonly known as the large ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and can reach heights of up to six feet. Its showy, yellow to orange flower heads bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
