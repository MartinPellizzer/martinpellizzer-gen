    "intro": "Vitis sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous grapevine, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of edible berries. These berries are typically dark blue to black in color and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. Vitis sinuata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to humid climates."
