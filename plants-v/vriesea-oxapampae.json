    "intro": "Vriesea oxapampae, commonly known as the Andean flame torch, is a striking bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It features a compact rosette of broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces an inflorescence that resembles a torch, with vibrant orange or red flowers emerging from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea oxapampae is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
