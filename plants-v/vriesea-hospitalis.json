    "intro": "Vriesea hospitalis, commonly known as the hospital bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea hospitalis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
