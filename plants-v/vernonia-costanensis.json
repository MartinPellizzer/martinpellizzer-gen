    "intro": "Vernonia costanensis, commonly known as the coastal ironweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple conical flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia costanensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in coastal ecosystems."
