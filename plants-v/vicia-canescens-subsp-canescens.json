It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
