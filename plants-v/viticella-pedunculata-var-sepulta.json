    "intro": "Viticella pedunculata var. sepulta, commonly known as the buried grapevine, is a unique variant of the grapevine species characterized by its subterranean growth habit. This plant typically grows with its stems and roots concealed beneath the soil surface, forming a dense, sprawling network. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, adapting to low-light conditions underground. The flowers, though less visible, produce small, clustered fruits that can be harvested when mature. This variety is notable for its resilience in poor soil conditions and its historical use in traditional horticulture practices."
