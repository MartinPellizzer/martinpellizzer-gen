    "intro": "Verbena wrightii, commonly known as blue verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white to gray pubescence. Verbena wrightii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
