    "intro": "Vernonia virens var. megacephala, commonly known as the giant ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy blue-purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, tubular florets arranged in dense, composite flower heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This species is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
