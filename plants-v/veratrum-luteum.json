    "intro": "Veratrum luteum, commonly known as the yellow hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are followed by egg-shaped berries that turn red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant contains various toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
