    "intro": "Vernonia chimborazensis, commonly known as the Andean ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish to reddish-orange flowers. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean highlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Vernonia chimborazensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
