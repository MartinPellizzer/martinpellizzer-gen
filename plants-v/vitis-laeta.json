    "intro": "Vitis laeta, commonly known as the whitebark grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a white or pale underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries that are typically red or black when mature. Vitis laeta is adapted to moist, woodland environments and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and historical botanical research."
