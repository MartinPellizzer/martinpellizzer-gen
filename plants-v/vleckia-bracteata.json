    "intro": "Vleckia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Vleckia bracteata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
