    "intro": "Vitis xunyangensis, commonly known as the Xunyang grapevine, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is native to China, specifically the Xunyang region in Hubei Province, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, tendrils, and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white, and it produces small, sweet berries that are not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vitis xunyangensis is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
