    "intro": "Verbena litoralis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered seaside verbena, is a compact, flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the summer, adding a delicate touch to sandy or rocky shores. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for growing in well-drained soils and full sun."
