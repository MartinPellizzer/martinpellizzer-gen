    "intro": "Vanilla africana subsp. cucullata, commonly known as the African vanilla or the hooded vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical Africa. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. The plant's most notable feature is its long, thin, greenish-yellow pods that develop after flowering. These pods, which resemble slender beans, are harvested and dried to develop the characteristic vanilla flavor. The botanical structure of the plant includes a fibrous root system and broad, heart-shaped leaves."
