    "intro": "Vitellaria rivicoa, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a rich, buttery seed kernel. The kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and traditional medicine. Vitellaria rivicoa plays a vital role in local ecosystems and supports biodiversity in its native habitat."
