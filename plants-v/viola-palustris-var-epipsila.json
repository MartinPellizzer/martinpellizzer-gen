    "intro": "Viola palustris var. epipsila, commonly known as the swamp violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive purple underside, and its flowers are typically violet or purple with yellow markings. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is closely related to other viola species and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
