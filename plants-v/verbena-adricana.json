    "intro": "Verbena adricana, commonly known as the Cape verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, usually in shades of blue, purple, and red. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Verbena adricana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
