    "intro": "Vulpia bromoides var. sciuroides, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
