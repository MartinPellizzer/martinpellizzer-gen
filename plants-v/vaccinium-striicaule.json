    "intro": "Vaccinium striicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like heathers and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which eventually give way to edible, bright blue berries. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Vaccinium striicaule thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters."
