    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys subsp. chamaedrys, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pairs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, often covered in a white powdery coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
