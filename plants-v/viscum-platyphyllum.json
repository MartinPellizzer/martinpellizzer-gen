    "intro": "Viscum platyphyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified to form a spongy, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds coated in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. Viscum platyphyllum is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host trees."
