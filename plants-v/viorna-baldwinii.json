    "intro": "Viorna baldwinii, commonly known as the Baldwin's viorna, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Violaceae family, which includes violets and related species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viorna baldwinii is considered a vulnerable species."
