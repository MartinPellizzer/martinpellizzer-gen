    "intro": "Vincetoxicum parvifolium, commonly known as small-leaved ironweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on elongated, bracted inflorescences. Its fibrous roots and hairy stems contribute to its ability to thrive in moist, woodland environments. Vincetoxicum parvifolium is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas, growing along stream banks and in forest understories."
