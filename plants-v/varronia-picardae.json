    "intro": "Varronia picardae, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark red heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in lowland tropical forests and is known for its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, and the plant is often cultivated for its timber and medicinal properties. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
