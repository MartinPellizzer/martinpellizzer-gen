    "intro": "Vandopsis chalmersiana, commonly known as the Chalmers' vandopsis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a soft, pale green color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
