    "intro": "Verbena megapotamica f. truncatula, commonly known as the truncate verbena, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established."
