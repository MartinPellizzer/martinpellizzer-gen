    "intro": "Vindasia virgata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil. The plant is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Vindasia virgata has no leaves, relying entirely on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered."
