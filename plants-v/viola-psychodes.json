    "intro": "Viola psychodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale violet flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. It is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive strategies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Viola psychodes is considered endangered in many regions."
