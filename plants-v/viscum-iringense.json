    "intro": "Viscum iringense, commonly known as the Irish mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It grows on the branches of deciduous trees, primarily oak and hawthorn, in temperate regions of Europe. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures called phylloids. Its berries are small, white or yellowish, and contain toxic compounds. Viscum iringense plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
