    "intro": "Vittaria squamosipes, commonly known as the scaly maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant's leaves are typically covered in small, scale-like structures, which give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Vittaria squamosipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
