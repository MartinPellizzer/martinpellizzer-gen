    "intro": "Valeriana oxyrioides, commonly known as sweet valerian, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Valeriana oxyrioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
