    "intro": "Veronica arvensis subsp. pseudoarvensis, commonly known as common speedwell, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
