    "intro": "Vanda tricolor var. insignis, commonly known as the Three-color Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking tricolor petals, typically featuring combinations of red, yellow, and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, warm environments. Its flowers are borne on long, pendulous inflorescences and can last for several weeks. Vanda tricolor var. insignis requires bright light and well-draining potting media to flourish."
