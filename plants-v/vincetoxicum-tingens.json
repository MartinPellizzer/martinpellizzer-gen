    "intro": "Vincetoxicum tingens, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn bright red in the fall, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which give way to orange-red berries in the autumn. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds that can cause severe health issues. Vincetoxicum tingens is often found in woodland edges and thickets, thriving in partial to full shade."
