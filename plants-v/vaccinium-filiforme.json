    "intro": "Vaccinium filiforme, commonly known as the slender blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Vaccinium filiforme is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
