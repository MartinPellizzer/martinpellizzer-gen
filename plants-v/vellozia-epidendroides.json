    "intro": "Vellozia epidendroides, commonly known as the coastal vellozia, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is valued in both horticulture and ecological studies."
