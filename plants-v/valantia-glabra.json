    "intro": "Valantia glabra, commonly known as the smooth valantia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, glabrous leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Valantia glabra is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
