    "intro": "Vernonia atriplicifolia, commonly known as black ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped with prominent veins, and the plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Vernonia atriplicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
