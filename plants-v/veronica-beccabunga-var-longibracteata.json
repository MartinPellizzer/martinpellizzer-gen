    "intro": "Veronica beccabunga var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to wildlife gardens. The variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts, which are modified leaves surrounding the flower clusters."
