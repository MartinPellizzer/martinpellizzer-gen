    "intro": "Valeriana multiceps var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are aromatic and contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. This variant is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf edges, which set it apart from other valerian species."
