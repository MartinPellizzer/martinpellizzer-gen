    "intro": "Verbesina tachirensis, commonly known as the Tachira beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, often surrounded by bracts. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open woodland and disturbed areas. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat."
