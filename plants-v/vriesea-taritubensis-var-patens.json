    "intro": "Vriesea taritubensis var. patens, commonly known as the Patens Vriesea, is a bromeliad native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, recurved foliage that forms a rosette shape, which helps collect rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
