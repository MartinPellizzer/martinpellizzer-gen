    "intro": "Viburnum discolor, commonly known as the American elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the summer. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high concentration of compounds. Viburnum discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to wildlife."
