It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are clustered in loose panicles, typically blooming from late summer into early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
