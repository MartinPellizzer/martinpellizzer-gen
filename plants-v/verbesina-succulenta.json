    "intro": "Verbesina succulenta, commonly known as the woolly beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, bristly capsule that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Verbesina succulenta is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
