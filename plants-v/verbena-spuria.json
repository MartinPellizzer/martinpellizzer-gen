    "intro": "Verbena spuria, commonly known as common vervain, is an annual herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, and clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in full sun. It is often found in temperate climates and is known for its ability to self-seed readily. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable plant in ecological gardens."
