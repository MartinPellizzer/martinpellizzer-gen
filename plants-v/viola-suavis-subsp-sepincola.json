    "intro": "Viola suavis subsp. sepincola, commonly known as the sweet violet's subspecies from the Apennines, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers with yellow centers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical sweet violet."
