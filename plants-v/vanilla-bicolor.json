    "intro": "Vanilla bicolor, commonly known as the twin-leaf vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's most notable feature is its unique two-lobed ovary, which gives it its scientific name. The vanilla pods, which develop from the flowers, are harvested and dried to produce the aromatic vanilla extract used in cooking and perfumery. Its cultivation requires a humid, warm climate with well-drained soil and partial shade."
