    "intro": "Valeriana sedifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, somewhat woody stems and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly layer. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late summer. Valeriana sedifolia is known for its strong, spicy scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
