    "intro": "Vanda, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic orchids native to Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific islands. These plants are characterized by their long, strap-like leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a wide range of colors. Vanda species typically thrive in warm, humid environments and require bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Their roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding surfaces. Vanda orchids are popular in horticulture due to their resilience and ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the year."
