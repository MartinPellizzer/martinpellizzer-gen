It is characterized by its long, slender, and often pendulous inflorescence that bears showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air and rain. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to store water. Vanda ampullacea thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light."
