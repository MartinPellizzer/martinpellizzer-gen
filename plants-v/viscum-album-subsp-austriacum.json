    "intro": "Viscum album subsp. austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a sticky substance to help it adhere to the host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe and is often found in forested areas. Its life cycle depends on the presence of its host tree and the birds that disperse its seeds."
