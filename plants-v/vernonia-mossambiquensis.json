    "intro": "Vernonia mossambiquensis, commonly known as the Mozambique ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
