    "intro": "Viscago viscosa, commonly known as the sticky willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Viscago viscosa is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments."
