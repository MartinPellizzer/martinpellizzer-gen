    "intro": "Varilla, commonly known as *Erythroxylum novogranatense*, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia and Venezuela. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round berries that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. Varilla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
