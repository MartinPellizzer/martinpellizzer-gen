    "intro": "Vaccinium ramosissimum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acid-loving plants like heathers and cranberries. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are bell-shaped and white, appearing in clusters, and it bears edible blue berries that are similar in taste to highbush blueberries. This species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
