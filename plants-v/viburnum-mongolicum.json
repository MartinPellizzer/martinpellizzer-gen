    "intro": "Viburnum mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to northern China and Mongolia. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. Its berries, which turn from red to black, are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Viburnum mongolicum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
