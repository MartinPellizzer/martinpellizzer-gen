    "intro": "Vicia brachyodonta, commonly known as the short-cowpea or narrow-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Vicia brachyodonta produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or through animal activity. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and compound leaves."
