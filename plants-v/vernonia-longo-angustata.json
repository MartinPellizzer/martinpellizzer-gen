    "intro": "Vernonia longo-angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Vernonia longo-angustata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
