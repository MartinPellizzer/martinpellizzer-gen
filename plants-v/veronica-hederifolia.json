    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and slightly hairy, with a distinctive waxy coating. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in woodland environments."
