    "intro": "Viola schleidettiana, commonly known as the Schleidert's violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. It prefers well-drained, moist soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
