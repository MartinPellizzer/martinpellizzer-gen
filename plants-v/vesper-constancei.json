    "intro": "Vesper constancei, commonly known as the evening constance, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant blooms during the late afternoon, hence its common name, and relies on specific pollinators active in the twilight hours. Vesper constancei thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
