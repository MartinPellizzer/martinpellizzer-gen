    "intro": "Vangueria lateritia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Vangueria lateritia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
