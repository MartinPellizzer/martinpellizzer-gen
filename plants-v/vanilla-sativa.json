    "intro": "Vanilla sativa, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are hand-pollinated to ensure fruit development. The plant's fruit, a dark brown pod, is the source of vanilla flavoring used worldwide. Vanilla sativa requires specific conditions, including high humidity and a tropical climate, to thrive. Its cultivation is labor-intensive, involving careful harvesting and curing of the pods."
