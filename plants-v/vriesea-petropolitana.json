    "intro": "Vriesea petropolitana, commonly known as the Brazilian star orchid, is a species of bromeliad native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height, featuring vibrant orange and red flowers. The plant has broad, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central tank to collect rainwater. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea petropolitana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
