    "intro": "Vernonia parthenioides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Vernonia parthenioides is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
