    "intro": "Vriesea fontanae, commonly known as the Fountain Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a fountain, hence its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of orange and red, are borne on a tall, leafless stem. Vriesea fontanae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
