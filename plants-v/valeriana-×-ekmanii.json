    "intro": "Valeriana \u00d7 ekmanii, commonly known as the Swedish valerian, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Valeriana officinalis and Valeriana sambucifolia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its aromatic, sometimes hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks, where it forms dense colonies. Valeriana \u00d7 ekmanii is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects, and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
