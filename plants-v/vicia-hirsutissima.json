    "intro": "Vicia hirsutissima, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Vicia hirsutissima is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
