    "intro": "Vernonia cotaniensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making."
