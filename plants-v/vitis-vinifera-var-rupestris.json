    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. rupestris, commonly known as the Rupestris grapevine, is a wild grape species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and deep root system, making it highly adaptable to various soil conditions. The plant produces small, sour berries that are not typically used for wine but are valuable for their hardiness and resistance to pests. Its foliage is thick and dense, providing good cover for wildlife. This variety is often used in viticulture for its grafting capabilities and as a rootstock for cultivated grapevines."
