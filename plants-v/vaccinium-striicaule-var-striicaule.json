    "intro": "Vaccinium striicaule var. striicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that range in color from blue to purple. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications. The plant prefers acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
