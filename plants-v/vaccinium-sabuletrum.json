    "intro": "Vaccinium sabuletrum, commonly known as the swamp blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically blue or black when mature, are edible and have a tart flavor. Vaccinium sabuletrum thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments."
