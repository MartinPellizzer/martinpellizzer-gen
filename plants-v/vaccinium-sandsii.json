    "intro": "Vaccinium sandsii, commonly known as the sand huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest. It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it has a dense, compact growth habit. Vaccinium sandsii plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
