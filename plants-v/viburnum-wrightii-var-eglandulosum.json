    "intro": "Viburnum wrightii var. eglandulosum, commonly known as the silky viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky gray or white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it has a compact, rounded growth habit. It is well-suited for use in native gardens and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
