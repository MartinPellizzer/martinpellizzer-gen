    "intro": "Veratrum tenuipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features tall, stout stems that bear large, showy white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its moist, forested habitat. It contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. This plant is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments."
