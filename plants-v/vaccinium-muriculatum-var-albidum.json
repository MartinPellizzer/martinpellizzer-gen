    "intro": "Vaccinium muriculatum var. albidum, commonly known as the white huckleberry, is a variant of the huckleberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that ripen in the summer. These berries are generally smaller and less acidic than those of the typical Vaccinium muriculatum. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
