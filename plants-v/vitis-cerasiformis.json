    "intro": "Vitis cerasiformis, commonly known as the cherry grape or red grape vine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, red, cherry-like berries that ripen in the fall. The plant produces tendrils for support and has a woody stem that can grow up to several meters in length. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters before the fruit develops. Vitis cerasiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible berries, which are used in jams and wines."
