    "intro": "Viola evae var. flossdorfii, commonly known as the Flossdorf violet, is a rare and charming member of the Violaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in Austria and the Czech Republic. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking violet-blue flowers with yellow centers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
