    "intro": "Vahlia capensis subsp. macrantha, commonly known as the Cape vahlia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
