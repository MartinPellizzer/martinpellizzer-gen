It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, leafy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
