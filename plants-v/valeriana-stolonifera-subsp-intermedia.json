    "intro": "Valeriana stolonifera subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, producing horizontal underground stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties have made it historically significant in herbal medicine."
