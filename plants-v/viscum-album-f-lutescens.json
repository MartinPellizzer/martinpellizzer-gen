    "intro": "Viscum album f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are typically red or yellow when mature. It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, and it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
