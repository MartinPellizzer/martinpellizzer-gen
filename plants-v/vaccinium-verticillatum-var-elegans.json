    "intro": "Vaccinium verticillatum var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, oval leaves that are typically a deep green and are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
