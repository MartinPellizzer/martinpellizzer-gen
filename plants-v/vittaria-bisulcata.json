    "intro": "Vittaria bisulcata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical fern species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that curl and twist as they grow. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a serrated edge, and its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Vittaria bisulcata is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
