It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring slender, aromatic stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Vitex lamiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions."
