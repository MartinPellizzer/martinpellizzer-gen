    "intro": "Vitis acerifolia, commonly known as the mapleleaf grape, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of round, black berries. Its leaves are typically lobed and can vary in size depending on the environmental conditions. Vitis acerifolia is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
