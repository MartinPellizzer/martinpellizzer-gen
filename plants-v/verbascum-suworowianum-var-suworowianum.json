    "intro": "Verbascum suworowianum var. suworowianum, commonly known as the Woolly Mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its hairy leaves and robust growth make it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
