    "intro": "Vereia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf vereia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Vereia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
