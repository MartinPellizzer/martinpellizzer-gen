    "intro": "Vanda tessellata subsp. tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated vanda, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, helping it store water in its native tropical and subtropical habitats. It thrives in high light conditions and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
