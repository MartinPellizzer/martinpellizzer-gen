    "intro": "Viola scrotiformis, commonly known as the bladder violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and small, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its name derives from the inflated, bladder-like structures on its stems, which are believed to store water. Viola scrotiformis is a perennial herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
