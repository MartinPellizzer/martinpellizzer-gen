    "intro": "Vincetoxicum villosum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seed pods are elongated and contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vincetoxicum villosum is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
