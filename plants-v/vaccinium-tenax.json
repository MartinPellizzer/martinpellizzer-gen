    "intro": "Vaccinium tenax, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, which are rich in antioxidants and nutrients. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in shaded woodland areas. The leaves are dark green and leathery, providing year-round visual interest in the landscape."
