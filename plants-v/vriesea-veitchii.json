    "intro": "Vriesea veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting green or white veins. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea veitchii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
