    "intro": "Viola flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive violet or purple coloration. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a yellow or brown throat. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Viola flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
