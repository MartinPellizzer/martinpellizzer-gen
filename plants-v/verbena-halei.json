    "intro": "Verbena halei, commonly known as Hale's verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Hale's verbena is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
