    "intro": "Verbesina greenmanii, commonly known as the greenman's ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled spheres that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Verbesina greenmanii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
