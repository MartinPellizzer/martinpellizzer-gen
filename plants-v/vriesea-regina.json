    "intro": "Vriesea regina, commonly known as the Queen Vriesea, is a tropical plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often with a yellow or green center. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea regina is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
