    "intro": "Vicia kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by slender, hairy pods containing several elliptical seeds. Vicia kurdica is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and along rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
