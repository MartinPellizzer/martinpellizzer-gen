    "intro": "Veronica senex, commonly known as old man's beard, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits called elaters, which aid in seed dispersal. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Veronica senex thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
