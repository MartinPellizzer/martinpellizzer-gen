    "intro": "Vitis umbellata var. arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan grapevine, is a rare and native species of the Vitaceae family found primarily in Taiwan. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend trees and other structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
