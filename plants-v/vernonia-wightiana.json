    "intro": "Vernonia wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, often branched stem and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to orange-red flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. These flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Vernonia wightiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
