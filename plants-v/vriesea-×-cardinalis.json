    "intro": "Vriesea \u00d7 cardinalis, commonly known as the Red-Striped Vriesea, is a hybrid bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a striking combination of red and green hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically short-lived but are followed by the production of numerous offsets, which contribute to its ease of propagation. Vriesea \u00d7 cardinalis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
