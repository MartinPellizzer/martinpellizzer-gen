    "intro": "Vicia hypolasia, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems that often grow along the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive hairy texture. Vicia hypolasia is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
