    "intro": "Vernonia declivium, commonly known as the cliff vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Vernonia declivium is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
