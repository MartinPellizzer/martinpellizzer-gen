It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits. Valeriana longipilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
