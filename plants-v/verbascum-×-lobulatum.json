    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 lobulatum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattellum, both of which are native to southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its showy yellow flowers appear in clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Verbascum \u00d7 lobulatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil conditions."
