    "intro": "Veronica spicata subsp. setulosa, commonly known as the spiked speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This perennial plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
