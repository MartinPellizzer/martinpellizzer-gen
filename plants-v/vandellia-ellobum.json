    "intro": "Vandellia ellobum, commonly known as the green vandellia, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which help it blend into its natural surroundings. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, narrow leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its limited distribution and conservation status. Due to habitat loss and its rarity, Vandellia ellobum is considered a critically endangered plant."
