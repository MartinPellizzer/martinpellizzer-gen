It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom from spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Veronica cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its delicate appearance."
