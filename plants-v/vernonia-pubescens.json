    "intro": "Vernonia pubescens, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in conical clusters, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia pubescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage and flowers provide habitat and nectar for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
