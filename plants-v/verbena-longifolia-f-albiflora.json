    "intro": "Verbena longifolia f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered verbena, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and drought tolerance."
