    "intro": "Viola palustris, commonly known as the marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy violet flowers with five petals, often in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in swampy areas, bogs, and along stream banks. The marsh violet is an important plant for pollinators and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
