It is a leguminous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate and slightly hairy. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
