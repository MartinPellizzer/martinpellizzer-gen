    "intro": "Vitis litoralis, commonly known as the coastal grape or sea grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States, particularly in salt marshes and tidal areas. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it matures, providing food for various wildlife species."
