It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are small and winged. Virola boliviensis is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry."
