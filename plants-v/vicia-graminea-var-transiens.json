    "intro": "Vicia graminea var. transiens, commonly known as the transient vetch, is a leguminous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white pea-like flowers that bloom in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its ephemeral nature, it is sometimes referred to as a transient species, as it may appear and disappear from certain areas depending on environmental conditions."
