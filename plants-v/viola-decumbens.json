    "intro": "Viola decumbens, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or violet. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively. Viola decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
