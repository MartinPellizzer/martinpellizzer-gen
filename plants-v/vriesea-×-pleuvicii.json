    "intro": "Vriesea \u00d7 pleuvicii, commonly known as the hybrid Vriesea, is a hybrid cultivar resulting from the cross between Vriesea \u00d7 spectabilis and Vriesea \u00d7 ventricosa. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its striking, often brightly colored inflorescences. The plant typically features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its flowers, which emerge from the center of the rosette, are usually vibrant red, orange, or yellow, and can last for several weeks. Vriesea \u00d7 pleuvicii is a popular ornamental plant, valued for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
