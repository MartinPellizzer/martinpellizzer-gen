    "intro": "Vriesea oleosa, commonly known as the oil plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, recurved leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with red and yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea oleosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
