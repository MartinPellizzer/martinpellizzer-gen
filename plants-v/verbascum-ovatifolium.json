    "intro": "Verbascum ovatifolium, commonly known as the ovateleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, ovate-shaped leaves that are soft to the touch. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its common name reflects the distinctive shape of its leaves, which are broader and more ovate compared to other mullein species."
