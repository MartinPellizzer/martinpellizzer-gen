    "intro": "Vittaria angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, strap-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Vittaria angustifrons is notable for its ability to retain moisture and its role in forest ecosystems."
