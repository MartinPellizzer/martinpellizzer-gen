    "intro": "Valeriana aegaea, commonly known as the Greater Valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils, particularly valerenic acid. Its rhizomatous root system is often used in traditional medicine for its sedative and calming properties. Valeriana aegaea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas."
