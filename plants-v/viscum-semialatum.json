    "intro": "Viscum semialatum, commonly known as the partial leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are followed by small, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis. Viscum semialatum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
