    "intro": "Vandellia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf vandellia, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its flowers are usually small, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale pink, and it produces tiny, fleshy fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Vandellia minuta is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
