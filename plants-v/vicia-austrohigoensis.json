    "intro": "Vicia austrohigoensis, commonly known as the southern higo vetch, is a flowering plant species native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by slender, pod-like fruits. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments and is often found in the Andean regions of Chile and Argentina. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Vicia genus."
