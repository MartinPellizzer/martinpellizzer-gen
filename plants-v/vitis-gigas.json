    "intro": "Vitis gigas, commonly known as the giant grapevine, is a woody vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 10 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color in the fall. Vitis gigas is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
