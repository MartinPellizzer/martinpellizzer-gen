    "intro": "Vicia pallida, commonly known as the pale vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its flowers are small and pea-like, with a white or pale pink color, and it produces slender, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Vicia pallida is also valued for its role in ecological restoration due to its ability to improve soil fertility."
