    "intro": "Viscum diospyrosicola, commonly known as the Japanese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is native to parts of East Asia, including Japan and China. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its small, white or greenish-white flowers are followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Viscum diospyrosicola is typically found in temperate forests and can have both ecological and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
