    "intro": "Verbascum rotundifolium subsp. conocarpum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its thick, woolly leaves that are covered in soft, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, erect stems topped with clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, making it a hardy and resilient species."
