    "intro": "Vernonia tricholoba, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, grayish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Vernonia tricholoba is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
