    "intro": "Vochysia acuminata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or velvetwood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in musical instrument making, it is also of ecological and economic significance."
