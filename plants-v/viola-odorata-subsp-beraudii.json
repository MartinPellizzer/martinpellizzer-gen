It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often featuring a distinctive yellow or white spot.
