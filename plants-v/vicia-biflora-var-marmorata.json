    "intro": "Vicia biflora var. marmorata, commonly known as the marbled vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive marbled pattern on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
