It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical purple-flowered Viola tricolor. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, delicate blooms. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
