    "intro": "Vriesea breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range from yellow to orange-red. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a visually appealing structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea breviscapa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
