    "intro": "Vriesea schunkii, commonly known as the Schunk's Vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, recurved inflorescence that displays vibrant colors, often in shades of red and orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool. Its flowers are typically short-lived but are followed by a long-lasting bract that remains colorful for an extended period. Vriesea schunkii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
