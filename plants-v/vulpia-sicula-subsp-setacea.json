    "intro": "Vulpia sicula subsp. setacea, commonly known as the Sicilian vulpia, is a grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the apex of each stem, which is typically bracted and compact. It prefers dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed areas. This subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in stabilizing sandy environments."
