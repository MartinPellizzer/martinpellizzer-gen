    "intro": "Valantia hypocarpia, commonly known as the silverleaf starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy, silver-gray leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy habitats. Valantia hypocarpia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and floral display."
