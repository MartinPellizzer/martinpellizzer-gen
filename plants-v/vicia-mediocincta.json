    "intro": "Vicia mediocincta, commonly known as the narrow-belted vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive narrow, dark green stripe running along the central leaflet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Vicia mediocincta is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
