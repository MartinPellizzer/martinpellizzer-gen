    "intro": "Vicia variegata, commonly known as the spotted vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often branch near the base, with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. Vicia variegata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
