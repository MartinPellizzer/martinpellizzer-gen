It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its berries, which are typically red or black when mature, are edible and have a tart flavor. Vaccinium taquetii is adapted to grow in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in high-altitude regions."
