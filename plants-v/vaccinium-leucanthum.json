    "intro": "Vaccinium leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered huckleberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible berries that are typically white or yellow in color. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit that helps it thrive in rocky or acidic soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
