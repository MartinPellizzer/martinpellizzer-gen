    "intro": "Vaccinium caudatum, commonly known as the trailing evergreen blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Vaccinium caudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
