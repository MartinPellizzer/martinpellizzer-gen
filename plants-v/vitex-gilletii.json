    "intro": "Vitex gilletii, commonly known as the silverleaf chaste tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its greyish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Vitex gilletii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils."
