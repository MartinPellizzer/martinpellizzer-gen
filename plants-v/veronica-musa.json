    "intro": "Veronica musa, commonly known as the musk veronica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Veronica musa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
