    "intro": "Verbena paucifolia, commonly known as the silver verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Verbena paucifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
