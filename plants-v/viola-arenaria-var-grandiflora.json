It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is a perennial species that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar ecological conditions."
