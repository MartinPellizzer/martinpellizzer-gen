    "intro": "Verbascum boerhavii var. longebracteatum, commonly known as the long bract mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers clustered in dense, candle-like inflorescences, typical of the genus Verbascum. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
