    "intro": "Vahlia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous vahlia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into three to five lobes, and its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters. Vahlia dichotoma is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
