    "intro": "Vicia villosa subsp. garbiensis, commonly known as the Garbiensk vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the genus Vicia. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
