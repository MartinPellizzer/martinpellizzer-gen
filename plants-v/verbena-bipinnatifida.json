    "intro": "Verbena bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Verbena bipinnatifida is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
