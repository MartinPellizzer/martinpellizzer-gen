    "intro": "Vatica oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. Vatica oblongifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture. It plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
