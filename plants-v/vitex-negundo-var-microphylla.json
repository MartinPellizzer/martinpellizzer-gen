    "intro": "Vitex negundo var. microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese vitex or small-leaved chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Vitex negundo. The plant produces fragrant, blue-violet flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry nuts that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
