    "intro": "Veronica spadana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters along the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Veronica spadana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
