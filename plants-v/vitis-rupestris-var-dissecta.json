    "intro": "Vitis rupestris var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected rock grape, is a rare and ornamental vine native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely lobed, trifoliate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically black or dark purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found growing on cliffs or slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
