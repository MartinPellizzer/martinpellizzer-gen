    "intro": "Vaccinium sessififlorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue to purple in color, rich in antioxidants and flavor. The plant has elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and heathlands. The flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or white, contributing to its ornamental value."
