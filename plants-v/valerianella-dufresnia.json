    "intro": "Valerianella dufresnia, commonly known as dwarf valerian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Valerianella dufresnia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
