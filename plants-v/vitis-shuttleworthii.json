It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
