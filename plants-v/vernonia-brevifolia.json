It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia brevifolia is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
