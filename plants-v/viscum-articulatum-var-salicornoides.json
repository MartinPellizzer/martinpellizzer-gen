    "intro": "Viscum articulatum var. salicornoides, commonly known as the sea sprout or sea holly, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branched structure covered in tiny, fleshy leaves that resemble small, green spikes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
