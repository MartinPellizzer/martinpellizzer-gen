    "intro": "Vanilla aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white flowers that bloom once a year, often in the summer months. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Vanilla aphylla is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
