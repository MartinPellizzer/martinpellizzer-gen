    "intro": "Verbesina mutica, commonly known as the hairy beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a fuzzy surface. Verbesina mutica is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
