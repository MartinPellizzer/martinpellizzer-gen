It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Its showy purple to pink flower heads bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's sturdy stems and fibrous roots make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
