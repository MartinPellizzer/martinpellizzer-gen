    "intro": "Vittaria pusilla var. wooroonooran, commonly known as the Wooroonooran maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the genus Vittaria. This variety is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust fronds compared to the typical Vittaria pusilla."
