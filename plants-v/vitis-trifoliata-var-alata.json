    "intro": "Vitis trifoliata var. alata, commonly known as winged grape or Japanese winged grape, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive three-leaf compound leaves, with the central leaflet often bearing wing-like structures along its edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, sweet-tart berries in the fall. It is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
