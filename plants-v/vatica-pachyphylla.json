    "intro": "Vatica pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Its bark is rough and fissured, and the wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Vatica pachyphylla is often found in lowland rainforests and is an important species in ecological and commercial contexts."
