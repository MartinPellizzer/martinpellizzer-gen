    "intro": "Vatica badiifolia, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, Vatica badiifolia is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
