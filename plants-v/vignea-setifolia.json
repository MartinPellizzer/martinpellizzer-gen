    "intro": "Vignea setifolia, commonly known as the hairy beggar-tick, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spiny capsules, which help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Vignea setifolia is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
