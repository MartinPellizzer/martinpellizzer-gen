    "intro": "Vitex evoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in the summer. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Vitex evoluta is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
