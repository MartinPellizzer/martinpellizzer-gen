    "intro": "Vitex geniculata, commonly known as the creeping chaste tree, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing bushes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Vitex geniculata is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and its drought-tolerant nature."
