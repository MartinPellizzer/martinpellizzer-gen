    "intro": "Vernonia pulgarensis, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for gardens in warmer climates. The genus Vernonia is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae), and V. pulgarensis is known for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
