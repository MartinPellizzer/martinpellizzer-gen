    "intro": "Veratrum album proles lobelianum, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers in late summer, which are followed by egg-shaped berries that turn dark blue as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
