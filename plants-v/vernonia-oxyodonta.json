    "intro": "Vernonia oxyodonta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia oxyodonta is often found in moist to wet soils in prairies, swamps, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions make it a useful plant for ecological restoration projects."
