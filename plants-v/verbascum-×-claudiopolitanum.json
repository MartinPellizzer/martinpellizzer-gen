    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 claudiopolitanum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattellum. It is a tall, herbaceous plant characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Its common name reflects its resemblance to the traditional mullein plant, which is also used for its medicinal properties."
