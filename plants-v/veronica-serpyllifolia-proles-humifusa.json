    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia proles humifusa, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
