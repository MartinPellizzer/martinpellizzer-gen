It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
