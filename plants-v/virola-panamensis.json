It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds.

The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
