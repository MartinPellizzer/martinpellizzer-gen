    "intro": "Vulpia fontqueriana, commonly known as the Fontquerian veldtgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Vulpia fontqueriana is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
