    "intro": "Verbascum euxinum, commonly known as the Crimean mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Verbascum euxinum is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
