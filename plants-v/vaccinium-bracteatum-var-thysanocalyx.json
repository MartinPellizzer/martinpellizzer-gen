    "intro": "Vaccinium bracteatum var. thysanocalyx, commonly known as the silverleaf blueberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a silvery-white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by edible, dark blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its potential as a fruit crop."
