    "intro": "Verbesina hispida, commonly known as rough henna, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its common name reflects its historical use in traditional dyeing practices, similar to true henna."
