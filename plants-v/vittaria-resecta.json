    "intro": "Vittaria resecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Vittaria resecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
