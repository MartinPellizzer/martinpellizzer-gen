    "intro": "Vochysia pongo-qonecensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian velvetwood, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Chrysobalanoaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
