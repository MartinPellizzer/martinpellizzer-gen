It is native to South America, particularly Bolivia, and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Vicia broteriana is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
