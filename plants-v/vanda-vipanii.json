It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are aerial, anchoring it to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Vanda vipanii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience in cultivation."
