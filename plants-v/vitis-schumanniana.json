    "intro": "Vitis schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is not typically used for wine production due to the low quality of its grapes."
