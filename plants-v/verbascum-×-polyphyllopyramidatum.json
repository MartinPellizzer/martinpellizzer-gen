    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 polyphyllopyramidatum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum phyllanthum and Verbascum pyramidatum. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are typical of the genus Verbascum. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in a pyramid-like arrangement, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
