It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America, characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically oval and have a slightly serrated edge, and they turn a vibrant red in the fall. The berries, which are edible, are usually blue or purple in color and are used both for culinary purposes and in ornamental landscaping."
