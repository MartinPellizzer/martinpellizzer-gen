It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Vicia glauca var. rifana is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
