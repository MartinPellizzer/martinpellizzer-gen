    "intro": "Vitis tuberculata, commonly known as the prickly vine or sand grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and small, grape-like fruits that are typically green when mature. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Vitis tuberculata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
