It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in umbels during late spring, followed by bright red, persistent berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Viburnum alabamense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
