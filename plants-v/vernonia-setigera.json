    "intro": "Vernonia setigera, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters. Vernonia setigera is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
