    "intro": "Viguiera squarrosa, commonly known as the silverleaf coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves provide a distinctive appearance, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera squarrosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
