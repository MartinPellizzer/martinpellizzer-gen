    "intro": "Vanda tricolor var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple vanda, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that typically feature a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical climate. Vanda tricolor var. purpurea is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the year."
