    "intro": "Vriesea cornus-cervi, commonly known as the horned vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a horn, giving it its common name. The plant features rosettes of broad, waxy leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. It produces vibrant orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Vriesea cornus-cervi is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and ability to thrive in humid environments."
