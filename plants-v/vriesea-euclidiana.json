    "intro": "Vriesea euclidiana, commonly known as the golden torch bromeliad, is a striking evergreen plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant yellow flowers, which contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Vriesea euclidiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
