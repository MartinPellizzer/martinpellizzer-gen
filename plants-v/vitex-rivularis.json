    "intro": "Vitex rivularis, commonly known as the river vitex, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vitex rivularis is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
