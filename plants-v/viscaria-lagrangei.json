    "intro": "Viscaria lagrangei, commonly known as the Lagrange's vetch, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Viscaria lagrangei is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
