    "intro": "Vincetoxicum aphyllum, commonly known as the nakedleaf thornapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to distinctive, spiny, orange-red berries that mature in the fall. Vincetoxicum aphyllum is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
