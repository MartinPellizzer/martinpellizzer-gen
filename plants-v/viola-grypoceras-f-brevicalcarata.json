    "intro": "Viola grypoceras f. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred violet, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral morphology. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Alps. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, violet-blue flowers with short, spurred petals. Its foliage often has a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential adaptations to high-altitude environments."
