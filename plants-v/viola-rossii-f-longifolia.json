    "intro": "Viola rossii f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered violet, is a variant of the viola genus native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender petals that are typically a deep violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in rocky soils and alpine habitats, where it blooms in early spring. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
