    "intro": "Vitis cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf grape, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, sweet berries that are typically consumed by wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to habitat loss, Vitis cardiophylla is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
