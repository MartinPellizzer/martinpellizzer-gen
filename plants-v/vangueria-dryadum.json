    "intro": "Vangueria dryadum, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Vangueria dryadum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
