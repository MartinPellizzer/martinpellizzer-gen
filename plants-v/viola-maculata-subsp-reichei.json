    "intro": "Viola maculata subsp. reichei, commonly known as the spotted violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, toothed leaves with a distinctive purple-tinged underside. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet, blue, and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense mats over time."
