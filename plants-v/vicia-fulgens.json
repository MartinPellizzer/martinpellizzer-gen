    "intro": "Vicia fulgens, commonly known as the golden vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in early summer. Vicia fulgens is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or along roadsides."
