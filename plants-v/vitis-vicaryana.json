    "intro": "Vitis vicaryana, commonly known as the river grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color in the fall. Vitis vicaryana thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
