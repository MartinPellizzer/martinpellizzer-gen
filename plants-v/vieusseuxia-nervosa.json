    "intro": "Vieusseuxia nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
