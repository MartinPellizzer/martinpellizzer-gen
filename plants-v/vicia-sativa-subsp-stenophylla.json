    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant features slender, ascending stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are arranged in elongated racemes, and it produces lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. As a member of the legume family, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules, contributing to soil fertility."
