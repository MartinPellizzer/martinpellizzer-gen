It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall, are usually blue to purple in color and attract various pollinators. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
