    "intro": "Verbascum sorgerae, commonly known as the Sorger's mullein, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is adapted to rocky and arid environments. Its leaves are broad and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum sorgerae is often found in open habitats such as slopes and meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
