    "intro": "Viola oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with heart-shaped, velvety leaves and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It is characterized by its unique floral structure and has adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native environment. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
