    "intro": "Viorna glaucophylla, commonly known as the blue-leaf viorna, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of a waxy cuticle that reflects light. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Viorna glaucophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
