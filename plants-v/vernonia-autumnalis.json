    "intro": "Vernonia autumnalis, commonly known as autumn ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, conical flower heads. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early fall, producing clusters of purple to pink bracts that surround small, yellow disk flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a silver-gray underside. Vernonia autumnalis is often found in dry to moist soils in woodlands, prairies, and along streambanks."
