    "intro": "Viscum fragile, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a waxy surface, while its small white flowers appear in clusters. The plant produces small, sticky berries that are eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Viscum fragile is often associated with holiday traditions and has cultural significance in many regions."
