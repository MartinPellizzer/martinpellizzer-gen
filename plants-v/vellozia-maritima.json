    "intro": "Vellozia maritima, commonly known as the coastal vellozia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Vellozia maritima plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
