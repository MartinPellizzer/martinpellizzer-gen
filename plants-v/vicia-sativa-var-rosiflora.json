    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. rosiflora, commonly known as the pink vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple stipple on the petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
