    "intro": "Vaupelia hispidissima, commonly known as the rough-leaved vaupelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs that help reduce water loss. Vaupelia hispidissima is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
