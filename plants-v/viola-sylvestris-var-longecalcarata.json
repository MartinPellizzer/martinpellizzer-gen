    "intro": "Viola sylvestris var. longecalcarata, commonly known as the long-beaked violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often bearing a distinctive spur, which is longer than the typical variety, giving it its specific epithet. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
