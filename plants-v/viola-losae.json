    "intro": "Viola losae, commonly known as the Losa Violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often adorned with distinctive markings. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Viola losae is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
