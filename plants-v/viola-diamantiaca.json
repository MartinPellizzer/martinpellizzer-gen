    "intro": "Viola diamantiaca, commonly known as the Diamond Violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Viola diamantiaca is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
