    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. tiliifolia, commonly known as the tiliifolia grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring large, lobed leaves that are distinct from typical Vitis species. The plant is native to the Caucasus region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It produces small, aromatic berries that are often used in local winemaking traditions. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a rare and intriguing subject in botanical studies."
