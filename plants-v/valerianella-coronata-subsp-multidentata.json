    "intro": "Valerianella coronata subsp. multidentata, commonly known as the purple false shamrock, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tiny, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
