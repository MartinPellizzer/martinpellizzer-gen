The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with upright stems and clusters of flowers at the top. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Viola robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
