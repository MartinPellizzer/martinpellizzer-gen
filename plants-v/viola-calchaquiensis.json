    "intro": "Viola calchaquiensis, commonly known as the Calchaqui violet, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its vibrant violet or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Viola calchaquiensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
