    "intro": "Vincetoxicum schippii, commonly known as Schippi's false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust root system and woody stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Vincetoxicum schippii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
