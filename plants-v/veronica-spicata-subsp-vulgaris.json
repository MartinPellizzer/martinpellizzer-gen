It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. This species is often used in gardens for its ability to attract pollinators and its hardy nature."
