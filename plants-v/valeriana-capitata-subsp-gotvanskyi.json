    "intro": "Valeriana capitata subsp. gotvanskyi, commonly known as Gotvansk\u00fd's valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, often blue or purple flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters at the top of the stems. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to other valerian species, and is used in traditional medicine for its calming effects."
