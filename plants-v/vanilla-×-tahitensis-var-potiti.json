    "intro": "Vanilla \u00d7 tahitensis var. potiti, commonly known as Tahitian vanilla, is a hybrid vanilla orchid native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its fragrant, dark brown pods that develop from its showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with high rainfall and is typically cultivated in shaded, well-drained soil. Its vanilla flavor is highly prized in perfumery and culinary applications due to its complex, sweet aroma. This variety is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in traditional Polynesian cultural practices."
