    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. gardinelii, commonly known as the Gardiner's grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and is primarily grown in specific regions with a climate suited to its cultivation. The plant exhibits typical Vitis vinifera traits, including tendrils and compound leaves. It is often used in viticulture for its unique flavor profile and adaptability. Due to its limited cultivation, detailed botanical studies on this variety are relatively scarce."
