    "intro": "Vincetoxicum obovatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, violet to purple berries that ripen in the fall, attracting birds and other wildlife. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in the spring before the leaves. Vincetoxicum obovatum is often grown for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
