    "intro": "Vernonanthura ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty vernonberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a rusty or reddish-brown pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. Vernonanthura ferruginea is typically found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
