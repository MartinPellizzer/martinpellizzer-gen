    "intro": "Vaccinium bullatum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically a deep blue or black color when mature. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy surface and remain green throughout the year. Vaccinium bullatum is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
