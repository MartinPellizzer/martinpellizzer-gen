    "intro": "Vicia peregrina subvar. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in long, slender racemes, which give the plant a delicate appearance. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
