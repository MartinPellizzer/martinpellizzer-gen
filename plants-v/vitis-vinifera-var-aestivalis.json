    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. aestivalis, commonly known as the early ripening grapevine, is a variety of the common grapevine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its early flowering and fruiting cycle, typically maturing earlier than many other Vitis vinifera varieties. The plant produces small, clusters of berries that are often used in winemaking or as table grapes. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its adaptability and role in both agricultural and horticultural settings."
