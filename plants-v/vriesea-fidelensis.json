    "intro": "Vriesea fidelensis, commonly known as the Fidelis Vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea fidelensis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
