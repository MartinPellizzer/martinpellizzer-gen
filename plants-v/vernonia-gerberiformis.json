    "intro": "Vernonia gerberiformis, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Vernonia gerberiformis is adapted to dry and semi-arid conditions, making it resilient in challenging environments."
