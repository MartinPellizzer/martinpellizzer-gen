    "intro": "Verbesina palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Verbesina palmeri is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some regions."
