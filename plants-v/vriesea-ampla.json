    "intro": "Vriesea ampla, commonly known as the star orchid, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and its showy, brightly colored inflorescence that resembles a star. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Vriesea ampla thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
