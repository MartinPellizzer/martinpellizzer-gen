    "intro": "Vicia californica, commonly known as California vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Vicia californica is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
