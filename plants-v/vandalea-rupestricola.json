    "intro": "Vandalea rupestricola, commonly known as the rock vandalea, is a rare and specialized plant native to the rocky habitats of the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in crevices or on cliffs. Its growth is slow, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as drought and extreme temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
