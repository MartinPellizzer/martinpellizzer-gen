    "intro": "Valeriana kilimandscharica subsp. elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon valerian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the East African Rift Valley, particularly around Mount Elgon. It features erect stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous root system is notable for containing volatile oils and alkaloids, contributing to its medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates at elevations above 2,000 meters."
