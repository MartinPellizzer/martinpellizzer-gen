    "intro": "Vatica lankaviensis, commonly known as the Sri Lankan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
