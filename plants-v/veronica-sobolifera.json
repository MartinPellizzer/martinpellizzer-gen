    "intro": "Veronica sobolifera, commonly known as the woolly speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant features hairy, gray-green leaves that are often glandular and covered in fine, woolly hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Veronica sobolifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive floral display."
