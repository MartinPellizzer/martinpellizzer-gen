    "intro": "Valeriana cernua, commonly known as blueweed or sweet woodruff, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant leaves and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats. Valeriana cernua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
