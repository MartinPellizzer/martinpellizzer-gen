    "intro": "Vidoricum moonii, commonly known as the Moon's Shadow Orchid, is a rare and elusive species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale violet petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow under moonlight, a trait unique to this species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky soil, while its leaves are narrow and waxy to reduce water loss. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Vidoricum moonii is considered a conservation concern."
