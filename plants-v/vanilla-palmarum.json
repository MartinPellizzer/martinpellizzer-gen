    "intro": "Vanilla palmarum, commonly known as the palmate vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of its characteristic vanilla pods. These pods, which mature to a dark brown color, are used in the extraction of vanilla flavoring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a support structure for its climbing growth."
