It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular, and often hairy leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces striking clusters of small, yellow to orange-red flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
