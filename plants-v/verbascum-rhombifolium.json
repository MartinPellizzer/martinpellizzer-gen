    "intro": "Verbascum rhombifolium, commonly known as the rhombic mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, broad, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
