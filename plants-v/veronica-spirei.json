    "intro": "Veronica spirei, commonly known as spiral veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to bloom throughout the summer season."
