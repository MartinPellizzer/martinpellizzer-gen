It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are often hairy and have a rosette-like arrangement, with small, blue to violet flowers clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its flowers are typically two-lipped and have five petals, characteristic of the Plantaginaceae family. Veronica subrosulata thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and high-altitude environments."
