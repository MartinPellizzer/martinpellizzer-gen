    "intro": "Vicia americana var. truncata, commonly known as the American vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of tendrils that help it climb or spread along the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and erosion control."
