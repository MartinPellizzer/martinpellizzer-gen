    "intro": "Vittaria flavicosta, commonly known as the golden-costly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish margin. The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and shade. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Vittaria flavicosta is often found growing on tree trunks or in moist, shaded forest floors, where it thrives in the understory of tropical rainforests."
