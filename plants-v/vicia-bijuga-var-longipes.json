    "intro": "Vicia bijuga var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the upper part. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in racemes during the spring and summer months. Its trifoliate leaves are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to thrive in poor conditions."
