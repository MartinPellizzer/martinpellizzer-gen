    "intro": "Viola rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are rounded at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Viola rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming appearance."
