It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their sedative properties. Valeriana aequiloba thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks."
