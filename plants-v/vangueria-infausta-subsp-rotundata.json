    "intro": "Vangueria infausta subsp. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved vangueria, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant."
