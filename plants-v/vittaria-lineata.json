    "intro": "Vittaria lineata, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinct line along the margins of the leaves. Vittaria lineata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
