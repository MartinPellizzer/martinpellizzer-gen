    "intro": "Vernonia theophrastifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fluffy, blue-gray inflorescences that resemble mist, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia theophrastifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
