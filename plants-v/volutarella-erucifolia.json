    "intro": "Volutarella erucifolia, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap aquatic prey, such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant has thin, delicate stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. It thrives in stagnant or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can efficiently capture and digest nutrients from its prey. Its unique adaptations make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
