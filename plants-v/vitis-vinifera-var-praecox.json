It is characterized by its early ripening trait, making it suitable for regions with shorter growing seasons. The plant produces small, cluster-like fruits that are typically harvested before the main grape varieties. Botanically, it has compound leaves with three to five lobes and produces small, green flowers that develop into berries. This variety is often used in winemaking and is valued for its adaptability to various climates."
