    "intro": "Veronica biserrata, commonly known as the double serrated speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with doubly serrated margins. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
