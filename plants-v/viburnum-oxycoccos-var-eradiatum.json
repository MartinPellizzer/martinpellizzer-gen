    "intro": "Viburnum oxycoccos var. eradiatum, commonly known as the swamp cranberry viburnum, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for wildlife. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces fragrant, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role and ornamental appeal in wetland restoration projects."
