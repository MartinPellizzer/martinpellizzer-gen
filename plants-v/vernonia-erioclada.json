    "intro": "Vernonia erioclada, commonly known as the velvetleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Vernonia erioclada is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
