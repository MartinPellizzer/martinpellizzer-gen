It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas. Vachellia viguieri is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
