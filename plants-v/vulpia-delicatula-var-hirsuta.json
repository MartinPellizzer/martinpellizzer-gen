    "intro": "Vulpia delicatula var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy vulpia, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture."
