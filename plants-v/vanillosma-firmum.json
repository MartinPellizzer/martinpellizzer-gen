    "intro": "Vanillosma firmum, commonly known as the smooth vanilla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often lack a distinct scent. The species is notable for its potential use in the production of vanilla extract, though it is less commonly cultivated than Vanilla planifolia."
