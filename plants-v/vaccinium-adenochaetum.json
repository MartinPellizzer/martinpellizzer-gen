    "intro": "Vaccinium adenochaetum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, dark blue, edible berries that are often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, providing a dense canopy that helps prevent erosion. Vaccinium adenochaetum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
