    "intro": "Viola pyrenaica subsp. montserratii, commonly known as the Pyrenean violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
