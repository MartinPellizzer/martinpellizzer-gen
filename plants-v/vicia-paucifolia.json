    "intro": "Vicia paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with few leaflets, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Vicia paucifolia is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
