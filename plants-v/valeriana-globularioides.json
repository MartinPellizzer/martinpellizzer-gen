    "intro": "Valeriana globularioides, commonly known as the globular valerian, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance. The species is also noted for its aromatic properties, though it is not as widely used in herbal medicine as other valerian species."
