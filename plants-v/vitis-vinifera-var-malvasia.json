    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. malvasia, commonly known as Malvasia, is a white grape variety with a long history of cultivation in Mediterranean regions. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green berries and is often used in the production of dessert wines and fortified wines. The plant typically exhibits moderate vigor and is adaptable to a range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. It is susceptible to certain diseases, such as powdery mildew, and requires careful vineyard management. Malvasia is also known for its aromatic profile, often featuring notes of honey, citrus, and floral undertones."
