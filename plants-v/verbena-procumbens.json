    "intro": "Verbena procumbens, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bright blue or purple flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Verbena procumbens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
