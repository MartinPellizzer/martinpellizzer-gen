    "intro": "Vincentia ensifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stem, narrow elongated leaves, and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, woody fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous covering. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental qualities. Vincentia ensifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
