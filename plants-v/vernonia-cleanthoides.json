    "intro": "Vernonia cleanthoides, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its fibrous roots help stabilize the soil in its native habitat. Vernonia cleanthoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
