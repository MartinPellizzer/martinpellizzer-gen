    "intro": "Vernonia volubilis, commonly known as creeping ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a trailing perennial that produces vibrant purple to pink flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a silvery underside. Vernonia volubilis is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in gardens."
