    "intro": "Veitchia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spirally arranged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy bark. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that emerge in a tight spiral pattern. This cycad is slow-growing and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
