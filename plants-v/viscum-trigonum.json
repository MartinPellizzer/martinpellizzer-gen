    "intro": "Viscum trigonum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees such as oak and apple. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Viscum trigonum is often associated with Christmas traditions, though its ecological role is more complex than its festive symbolism suggests."
