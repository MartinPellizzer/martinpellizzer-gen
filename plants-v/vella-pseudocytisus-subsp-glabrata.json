    "intro": "Vella pseudocytisus subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a hedge plant."
