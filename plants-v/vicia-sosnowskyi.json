    "intro": "Vicia sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, erect stems and is adapted to grow in rocky and arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
