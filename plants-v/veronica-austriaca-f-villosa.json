    "intro": "Veronica austriaca f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy speedwell, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often bear a dense covering of fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a similar hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
