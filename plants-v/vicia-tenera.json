    "intro": "Vicia tenera, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain several seeds. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Vicia tenera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
