    "intro": "Vitis vinifera f. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur grape, is a cold-hardy grapevine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, sweet berries and vigorous growth habit. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in cooler climates, making it suitable for cultivation in regions with shorter growing seasons. Its foliage is typically dark green, and it produces clusters of small, often aromatic grapes. This variety is sometimes used in viticulture for its adaptability and unique flavor profile."
