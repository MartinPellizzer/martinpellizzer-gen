    "intro": "Vincetoxicum strigosum, commonly known as the roughleaf false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces toxic berries that contain cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, woodland areas and is often found in shaded environments. Vincetoxicum strigosum is known for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
