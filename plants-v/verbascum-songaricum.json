    "intro": "Verbascum songaricum, commonly known as the Songaricum mullein, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative and anti-inflammatory properties. Verbascum songaricum is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
