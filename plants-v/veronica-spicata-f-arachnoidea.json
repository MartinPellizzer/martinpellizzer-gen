    "intro": "Veronica spicata f. arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-hair veronica, is a compact, flowering plant characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescences. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is native to Europe, particularly the British Isles. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces blue or purple flowers in early summer. Its unique name comes from the fine, hair-like structures on its stems, which resemble spider webs. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
