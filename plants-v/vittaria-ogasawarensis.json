    "intro": "Vittaria ogasawarensis, commonly known as the Ogasawara fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Ogasawara Islands in Japan. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often growing as a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vittaria ogasawarensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
