    "intro": "Viola venosa, commonly known as the purple violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a slight purple tinge. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, violet, and occasionally white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Viola venosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
