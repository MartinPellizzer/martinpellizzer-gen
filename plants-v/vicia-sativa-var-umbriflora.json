    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. umbriflora, commonly known as the shade vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects. This variety is less common than other vetch species but is valued for its adaptability to low-light conditions."
