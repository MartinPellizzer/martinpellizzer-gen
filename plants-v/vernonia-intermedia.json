    "intro": "Vernonia intermedia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, featuring a sturdy, branched stem. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, forming dense, mist-like clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant thrives in full sun to partial shade. Vernonia intermedia is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
