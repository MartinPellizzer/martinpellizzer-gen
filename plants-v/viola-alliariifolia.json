    "intro": "Viola alliariifolia, commonly known as the garlic violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a garlic-like scent, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
