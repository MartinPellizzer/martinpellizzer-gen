    "intro": "Vernonia angulata, commonly known as the angular Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are angular, giving it its common name. Vernonia angulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
