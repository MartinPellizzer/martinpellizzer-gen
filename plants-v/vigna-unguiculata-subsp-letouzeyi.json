    "intro": "Vigna unguiculata subsp. letouzeyi, commonly known as the African cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and distinctive pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in warm, tropical climates. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often cultivated for its protein-rich seeds, which are a staple food in many African countries. The species is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
