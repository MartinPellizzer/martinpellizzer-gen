    "intro": "Vicia solisii, commonly known as the sun vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and yellow flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vicia solisii is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
