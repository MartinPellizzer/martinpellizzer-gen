    "intro": "Vallaris grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered vallaris, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. Vallaris grandiflora is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
