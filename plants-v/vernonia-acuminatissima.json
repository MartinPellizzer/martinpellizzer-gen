    "intro": "Vernonia acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its fibrous roots and sturdy structure make it well adapted to moist, well-drained soils in wetlands and along stream banks. Vernonia acuminatissima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
