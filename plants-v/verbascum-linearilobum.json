    "intro": "Verbascum linearilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are lance-shaped and have narrow lobes. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Verbascum linearilobum is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
