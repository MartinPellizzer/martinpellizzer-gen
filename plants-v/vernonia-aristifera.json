It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, conical clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Vernonia aristifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
