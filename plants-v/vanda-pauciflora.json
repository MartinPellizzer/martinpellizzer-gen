    "intro": "Vanda pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered vanda, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Vanda pauciflora thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique botanical features make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts and horticulturists."
