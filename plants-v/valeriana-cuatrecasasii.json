    "intro": "Valeriana cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, often pungent scent, which is attributed to its essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Valeriana cuatrecasasii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its calming properties."
