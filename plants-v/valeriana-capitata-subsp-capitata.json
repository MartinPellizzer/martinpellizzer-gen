    "intro": "Valeriana capitata subsp. capitata, commonly known as sweet valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system is often used in traditional medicine for its sedative properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
