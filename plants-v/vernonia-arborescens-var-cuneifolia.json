    "intro": "Vernonia arborescens var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in rough, hairy texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces fluffy, yellow-green flower heads in late summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and bogs. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
