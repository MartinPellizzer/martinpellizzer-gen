    "intro": "Viola multistolonifera, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple and yellow. The plant spreads via stolons, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and natural landscapes."
