It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for dry, rocky environments. This variant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its distinctive foliage and hardy nature."
