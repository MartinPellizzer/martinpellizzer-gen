    "intro": "Vulpia reflexa, commonly known as the bentgrass or bentgrass vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on dry, disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Vulpia reflexa is adapted to harsh environments and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
