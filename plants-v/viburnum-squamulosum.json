    "intro": "Viburnum squamulosum, commonly known as the snowball viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring, giving it a striking, snowball-like appearance. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy beneath, and it produces small, dark blue berries in the fall. Viburnum squamulosum prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It is also valued for its fragrant flowers and moderate growth habit."
