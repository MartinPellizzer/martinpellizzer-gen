It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, producing small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
