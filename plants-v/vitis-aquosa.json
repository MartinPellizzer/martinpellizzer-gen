    "intro": "Vitis aquosa, commonly known as water grape, is a climbing vine native to wetlands and riparian zones in North America. It has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red or purple when mature. Vitis aquosa is often found in moist environments, where it thrives along streams, ponds, and marshes. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
