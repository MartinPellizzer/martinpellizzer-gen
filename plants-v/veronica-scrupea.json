    "intro": "Veronica scrupea, commonly known as the rough veronica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or mountainous regions. The plant features slender stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It produces clusters of blue or violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Veronica scrupea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
