    "intro": "Vittaria tenera, commonly known as the slender moss, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and its ability to form dense mats on rocky or wooded substrates. The plant has slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Vittaria tenera is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest floors."
