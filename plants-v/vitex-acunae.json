It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds.
