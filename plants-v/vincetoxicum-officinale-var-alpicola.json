It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to cold and nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind.
