    "intro": "Vaccinium littoreum, commonly known as beach strawberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or pink in color. Its leaves are oval and leathery, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit that helps stabilize dunes. Vaccinium littoreum plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
