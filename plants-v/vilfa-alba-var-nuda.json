It is characterized by its smooth, often hairless stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white flowers that are arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
