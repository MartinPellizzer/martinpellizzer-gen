It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green color and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of violet or blue. Its flowers are typically spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of the Violaceae family. Viola pseudasterias is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
