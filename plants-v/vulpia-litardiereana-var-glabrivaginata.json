It typically features narrow, linear leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface, distinguishing it from other varieties of Vulpia. The inflorescence is a loose panicle, bearing small, spikelet-based flowers. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in grassland ecosystems."
