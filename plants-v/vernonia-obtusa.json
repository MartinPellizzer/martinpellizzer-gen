    "intro": "Vernonia obtusa, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Vernonia obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
