    "intro": "Vitex pervillei var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy chaste tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its greyish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue or purple flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
