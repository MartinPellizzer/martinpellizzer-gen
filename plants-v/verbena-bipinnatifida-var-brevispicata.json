    "intro": "Verbena bipinnatifida var. brevispicata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
