    "intro": "Verbascum angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, woolly leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in rocky or dry soils and is valued for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
