    "intro": "Volutaria lippii var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are slender and often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Volutaria lippii var. atlantica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
