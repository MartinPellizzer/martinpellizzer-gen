    "intro": "Verbascum tripolitanum, commonly known as the Tripoli mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant features large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces tall spikes of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in arid gardens."
