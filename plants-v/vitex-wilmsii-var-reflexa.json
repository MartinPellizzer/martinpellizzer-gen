    "intro": "Vitex wilmsii var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed chaste tree, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
