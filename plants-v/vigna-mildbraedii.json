The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vigna mildbraedii is valued for its nutritional content, particularly its high protein and fiber levels, making it a potential crop for food and forage. It is also noted for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which can enhance soil fertility."
