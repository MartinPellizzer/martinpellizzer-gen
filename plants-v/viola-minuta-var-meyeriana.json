    "intro": "Viola minuta var. meyeriana, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with heart-shaped, dark green leaves and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in garden settings with proper moisture and light conditions."
