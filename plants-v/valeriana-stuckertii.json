    "intro": "Valeriana stuckertii, commonly known as Stuckert's valerian, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Valeriana stuckertii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system makes it a resilient plant that can spread through vegetative propagation."
