    "intro": "Veronica alpina var. unalaschcensis, commonly known as the Alaskan speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and western Canada. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures, making it a characteristic component of alpine flora."
