    "intro": "Vriesea hygrometrica, commonly known as the \"Hygrometric Vriesea,\" is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea hygrometrica is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
