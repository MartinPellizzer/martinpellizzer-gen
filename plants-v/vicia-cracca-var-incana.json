It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its pods are typically hairy as well. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
