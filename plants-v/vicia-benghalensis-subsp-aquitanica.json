    "intro": "Vicia benghalensis subsp. aquitanica, commonly known as the Aquitanian vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-natural habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
