    "intro": "Vriesea psittacina var. coccineis, commonly known as the red-veined vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, giving it a striking visual contrast. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear vibrant orange flowers, which bloom in succession over several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
