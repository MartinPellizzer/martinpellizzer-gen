    "intro": "Vriesea grandiflora, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that are often marked with white or silver stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. Its foliage is adapted to collect rainwater, which it uses for hydration and nourishment. Vriesea grandiflora is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
