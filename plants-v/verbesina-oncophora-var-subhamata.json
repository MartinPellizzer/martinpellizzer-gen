    "intro": "Verbesina oncophora var. subhamata, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a striking annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by a ring of narrow, grass-like bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, branching stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, producing a profusion of golden-orange blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
