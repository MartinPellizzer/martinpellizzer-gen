    "intro": "Viscum thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily oaks. It has small, leathery, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three. Its berries are small, bright red, and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Viscum thymifolium is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various bird species."
