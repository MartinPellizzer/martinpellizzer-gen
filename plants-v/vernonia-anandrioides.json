    "intro": "Vernonia anandrioides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces striking blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Vernonia anandrioides thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
