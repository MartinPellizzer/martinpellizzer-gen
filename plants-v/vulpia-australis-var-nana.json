    "intro": "Vulpia australis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf veldt grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
