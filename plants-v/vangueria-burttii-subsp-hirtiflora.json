    "intro": "Vangueria burttii subsp. hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered vangueria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a unique appearance and helps in reducing water loss."
