    "intro": "Viburnum pubinerve f. hydrangeoides, commonly known as the hydrangea-like viburnum, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are pubescent on both surfaces, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by ornamental, persistent red berries that add winter interest. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability in garden settings."
