    "intro": "Veronica peregrina var. subserrata, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, giving it the subserrata variety name. It is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats such as dry meadows and rocky outcrops."
