    "intro": "Verbena lindleyana, commonly known as the scarlet verbena, is a species of flowering plant in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Verbena lindleyana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
