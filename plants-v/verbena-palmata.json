    "intro": "Verbena palmata, commonly known as the Florida verbena or sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant has palmately arranged leaves, which give it its common name, and it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and dry, open habitats. Verbena palmata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
