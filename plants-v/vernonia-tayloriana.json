    "intro": "Vernonia tayloriana, commonly known as Taylor's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss."
