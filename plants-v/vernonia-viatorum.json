    "intro": "Vernonia viatorum, commonly known as the traveler's vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in the summer. Vernonia viatorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
