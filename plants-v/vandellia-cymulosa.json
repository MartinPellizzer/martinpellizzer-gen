    "intro": "Vandellia cymulosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, leafless stems and small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it highly specialized for its environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on the branches of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
