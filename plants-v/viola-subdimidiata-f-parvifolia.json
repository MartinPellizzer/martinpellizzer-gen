    "intro": "Viola subdimidiata f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved violet, is a rare and distinctive variant of the viola genus native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and heart-shaped, pale green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species. The flowers are usually pale purple or white, with a distinctive hooded structure and spurred petals, typical of the viola family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
