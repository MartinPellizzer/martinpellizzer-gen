    "intro": "Vicia purpurea, commonly known as the common vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of purple or violet pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions. Vicia purpurea is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in fields, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia."
