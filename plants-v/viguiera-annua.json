    "intro": "Viguiera annua, commonly known as Mexican heath, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera annua is often found in open woodlands and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
