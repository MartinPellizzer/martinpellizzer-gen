    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 arabkirense, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant in the Scrophulariaceae family. It is a hybrid between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum thapsus, resulting in a plant with distinctive fuzzy, velvety leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a dense layer of soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched stems that bear yellowish-green flowers in late summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to a variety of growing conditions."
