    "intro": "Verbena radicans, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across ground surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of violet, blue, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Verbena radicans is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun."
