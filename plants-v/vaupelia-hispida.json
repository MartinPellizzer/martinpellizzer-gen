    "intro": "Vaupelia hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf vaupelia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, serrated leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture levels. Vaupelia hispida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
