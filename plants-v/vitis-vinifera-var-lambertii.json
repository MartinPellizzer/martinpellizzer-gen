    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. lambertii, commonly known as Lambert's grape, is a rare and lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, intensely flavored berries that are typically used in niche winemaking. The plant exhibits typical Vitis vinifera traits, including compound leaves and tendrils for climbing. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period. Due to its limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and endangered variety in some regions."
