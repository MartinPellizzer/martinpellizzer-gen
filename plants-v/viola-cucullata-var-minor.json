    "intro": "Viola cucullata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces violet-blue or purple flowers with a distinctive hooded upper petal, which is a characteristic feature of the Viola genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is smaller than the typical Viola cucullata, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
