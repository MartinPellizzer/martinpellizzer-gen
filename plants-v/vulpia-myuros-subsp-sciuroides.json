    "intro": "Vulpia myuros subsp. sciuroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved veldgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal dunes. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing soils and its use in restoration ecology."
