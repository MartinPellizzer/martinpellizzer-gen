    "intro": "Vernonia divergens, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Vernonia divergens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
