    "intro": "Vitis canarensis, commonly known as the Canary Island grapevine, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a woody vine that typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences. Vitis canarensis produces small, round berries that are usually green when mature. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the volcanic and arid environments of the Canary Islands."
