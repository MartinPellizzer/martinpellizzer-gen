It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and ability to conserve water. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. This species is often found in rocky or limestone soils, reflecting its specific ecological preferences."
