    "intro": "Verbascum serpentinicum, commonly known as the serpentine mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on serpentine substrates, which are rich in minerals and low in nutrients. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Verbascum serpentinicum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
