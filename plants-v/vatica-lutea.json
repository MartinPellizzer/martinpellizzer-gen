It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in lowland and hill forests, growing up to 30 meters tall. Vatica lutea is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
