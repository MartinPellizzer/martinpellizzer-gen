    "intro": "Veronica alpina var. typica, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and hairy leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Veronica alpina var. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
