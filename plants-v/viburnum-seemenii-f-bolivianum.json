It features dense, rounded growth with small, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and hardy nature."
