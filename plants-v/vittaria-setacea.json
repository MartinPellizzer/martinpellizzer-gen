    "intro": "Vittaria setacea, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a characteristic feature of ferns. Vittaria setacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
