    "intro": "Vatica bella, commonly known as the beautiful vatica, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Vatica bella is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
