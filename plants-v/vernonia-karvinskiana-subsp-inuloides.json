    "intro": "Vernonia karvinskiana subsp. inuloides, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The species is notable for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
