    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. nodosa, commonly known as the nodose grape, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its distinctive nodular growth patterns on the stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically produces small, clustered berries with a deep purple color. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in wild or semi-wild settings. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant adaptations and genetic diversity."
