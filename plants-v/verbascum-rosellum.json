    "intro": "Verbascum rosellum, commonly known as the Roselle mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are broad and covered in soft, downy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum rosellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
