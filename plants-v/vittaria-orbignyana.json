    "intro": "Vittaria orbignyana, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria orbignyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
