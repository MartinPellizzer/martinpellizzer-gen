    "intro": "Verbascum lanatum subsp. lanatum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs that give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall fluffy look. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats."
