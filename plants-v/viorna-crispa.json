    "intro": "Viorna crispa, commonly known as the crinkled viorna, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a subtle elegance to its appearance. Viorna crispa thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soil, making it a challenging plant to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and is often found in conservation gardens."
