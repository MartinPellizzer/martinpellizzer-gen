    "intro": "Viscum articulatum var. liquidambaricola, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant produces small, yellowish-white berries that are toxic to many animals. It is often found in temperate regions where its host trees thrive. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced foliage and a reliance on host plants for survival."
