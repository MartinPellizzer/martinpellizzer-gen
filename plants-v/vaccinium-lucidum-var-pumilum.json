It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters, with small, oval leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which develop into edible, blue-black berries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
