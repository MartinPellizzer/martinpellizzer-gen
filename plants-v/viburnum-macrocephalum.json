    "intro": "Viburnum macrocephalum, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark purple, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Viburnum macrocephalum thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice in gardens."
