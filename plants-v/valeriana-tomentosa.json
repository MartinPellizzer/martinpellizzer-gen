    "intro": "Valeriana tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Valeriana tomentosa is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential calming properties."
