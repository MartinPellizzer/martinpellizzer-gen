    "intro": "Vochysia obovata, commonly known as the velvetleaf chandelier, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Vochysia obovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
