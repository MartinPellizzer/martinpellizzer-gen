    "intro": "Vaccinium diffusum, commonly known as the creeping blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other species in the Vacciniaceae family. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are white and clustered in racemes. Vaccinium diffusum plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
