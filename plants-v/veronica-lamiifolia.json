    "intro": "Veronica lamiifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Veronica lamiifolia is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
