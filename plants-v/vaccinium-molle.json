It produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tart flavor. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and prefers acidic, well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its fruit. Vaccinium molle thrives in partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
