    "intro": "Vigna procera, commonly known as the climbing pigeon pea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green and heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vigna procera is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various cuisines. It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
