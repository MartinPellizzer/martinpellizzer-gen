    "intro": "Viola gostivarensis, commonly known as the Gostivara violet, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of purple-pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Viola gostivarensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
