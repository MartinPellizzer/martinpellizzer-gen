    "intro": "Viburnum erubescens var. prattii, commonly known as the Pratts' cranberry viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features attractive, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun."
