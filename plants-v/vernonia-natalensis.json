    "intro": "Vernonia natalensis, commonly known as Natal ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and craftsmanship. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts used in traditional African medicine."
