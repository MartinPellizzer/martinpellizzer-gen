    "intro": "Vaccinium pterocalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaved huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue or black when mature, though they are often smaller and less flavorful compared to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. This plant plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species."
