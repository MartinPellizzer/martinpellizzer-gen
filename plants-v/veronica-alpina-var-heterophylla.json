    "intro": "Veronica alpina var. heterophylla, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped, though they may vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it a hardy and resilient species in high-altitude ecosystems."
