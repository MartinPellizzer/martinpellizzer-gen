    "intro": "Vandenboschia radicans var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are reduced to scales, which help minimize water loss in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
