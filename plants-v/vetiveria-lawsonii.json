It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often used for soil stabilization. Vetiveria lawsonii is also valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
