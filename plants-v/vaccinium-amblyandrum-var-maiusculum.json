    "intro": "Vaccinium amblyandrum var. maiusculum, commonly known as the large cranberry shrub, is a variant of the cranberry plant native to certain regions of South America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, acidic berries that are similar in appearance to typical cranberries but are often larger. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or bog environments. The leaves are dark green and leathery, with a dense, compact growth habit that helps it survive in its native habitat."
