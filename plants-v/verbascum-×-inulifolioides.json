    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 inulifolioides, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum inulifolium. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
