    "intro": "Vepris arushensis, commonly known as the Arusha cinnamon tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the East African highlands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its fragrant bark and leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
