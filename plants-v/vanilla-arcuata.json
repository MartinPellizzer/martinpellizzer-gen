    "intro": "Vanilla arcuata, commonly known as the zigzag vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging growth pattern and dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its vanilla-like aroma comes from the scent of its flowers, though it does not produce the same type of vanilla beans as Vanilla planifolia. This species is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and pleasant fragrance."
