    "intro": "Vitis koordersii, commonly known as the Koord's grape, is a species of flowering vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of berries, which are typically dark blue or black when mature. Vitis koordersii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. It is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for cultivation in specific climates."
