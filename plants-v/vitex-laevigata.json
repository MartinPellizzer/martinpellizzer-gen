    "intro": "Vitex laevigata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces fragrant, blue-violet flowers that bloom in panicles, typically in the summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds. Vitex laevigata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of dye."
