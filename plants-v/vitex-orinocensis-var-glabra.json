    "intro": "Vitex orinocensis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth vitex, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
