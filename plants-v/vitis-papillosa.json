    "intro": "Vitis papillosa, commonly known as the silky grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-gray underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by clusters of small, sour-tasting berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Vitis papillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
