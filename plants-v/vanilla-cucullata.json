    "intro": "Vanilla cucullata, commonly known as the hooded vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by pods resembling vanilla beans, though they are not used for flavoring. Vanilla cucullata thrives in humid, tropical environments with partial shade. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collectors."
