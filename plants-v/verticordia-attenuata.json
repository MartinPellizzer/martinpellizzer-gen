It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, wand-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in heathland and sandplain environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are often visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
