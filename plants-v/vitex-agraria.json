    "intro": "Vitex agraria, commonly known as the coffeeberry or wild coffee, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically purple or white, followed by round, berry-like fruits that change from green to red as they mature. Vitex agraria is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate saline conditions, making it adaptable to various environments. Its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties have contributed to its cultivation in some regions."
