    "intro": "Vernonia berteroana, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
