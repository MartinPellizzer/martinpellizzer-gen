    "intro": "Viola tricolor var. vectensis, commonly known as the Dutch viola, is a flowering plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets, and its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. It produces capsule fruits that contain several small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
