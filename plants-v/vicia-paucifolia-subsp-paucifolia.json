    "intro": "Vicia paucifolia subsp. paucifolia, commonly known as the lesser vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its low-growing habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
