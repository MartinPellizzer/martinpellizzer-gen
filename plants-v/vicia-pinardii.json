    "intro": "Vicia pinardii, commonly known as the Pinard vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Vicia pinardii produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, cylindrical pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or through animal activity."
