    "intro": "Ventilago diffusa, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its silvery-gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats."
