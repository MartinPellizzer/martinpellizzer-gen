    "intro": "Vachellia etbaica subsp. uncinata, commonly known as the Ethiopian umbrella thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland areas. The species is also valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for local fauna."
