    "intro": "Vilfa fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and often appear before the leaves fully emerge. Its roots are fibrous and can help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. The bark is smooth and grayish in color, with a rough texture that becomes more pronounced with age."
