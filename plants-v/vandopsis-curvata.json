    "intro": "Vandopsis curvata, commonly known as the curved vandopsis, is a rare epiphytic fern belonging to the family VANDACEAE. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically curved or arched in appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Vandopsis curvata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
