    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vetenata bromoides, commonly known as cheatgrass, is an annual grass native to Eurasia that has become invasive in many parts of the United States. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spikelet-like flowers that produce numerous seeds. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can rapidly colonize open areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and high seed production contribute to its invasive success and ecological impact. Ventenata bromoides is often found in rangelands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides, where it forms dense stands that alter ecosystem dynamics."
