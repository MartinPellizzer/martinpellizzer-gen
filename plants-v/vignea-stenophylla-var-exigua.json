    "intro": "Vignea stenophylla var. exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vigna, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
