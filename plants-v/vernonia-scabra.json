    "intro": "Vernonia scabra, commonly known as rough vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical heads, which are typical of the genus Vernonia. Vernonia scabra is often found in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
