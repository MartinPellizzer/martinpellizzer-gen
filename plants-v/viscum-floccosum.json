    "intro": "Viscum floccosum, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of white or grayish hairs. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Viscum floccosum is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees."
