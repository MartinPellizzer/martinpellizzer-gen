    "intro": "Viguiera mandonii, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces showy, pinkish-purple flower clusters in late summer to early fall. Viguiera mandonii is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, thriving in full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
