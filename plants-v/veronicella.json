    "intro": "Veronicella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They are characterized by their blue or violet flowers, which are often surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Veronicella species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
