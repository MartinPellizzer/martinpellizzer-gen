    "intro": "Viburnum sempervirens var. smitinandii, commonly known as the Smitinandii arrowwood, is a rare and unique cultivar of the common arrowwood. It is characterized by its striking, glossy dark green leaves that remain vibrant throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific cultivation requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
