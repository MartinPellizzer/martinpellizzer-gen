    "intro": "Vitis vulpina var. praecox, commonly known as the early fox grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in early summer. The plant typically grows along stream banks and in moist woodlands, preferring partial to full shade. Its berries are edible but have a tart, musky flavor, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal. It is also notable for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
