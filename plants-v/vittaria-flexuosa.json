    "intro": "Vittaria flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often exhibit a zigzag or undulating pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria flexuosa is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
