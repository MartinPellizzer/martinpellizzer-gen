    "intro": "Viburnum lentago, commonly known as white-fruited hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round, white berries that are edible but often have a mild, sweet taste. Viburnum lentago typically grows in moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade, reaching heights of up to 6 feet. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy flowers, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
