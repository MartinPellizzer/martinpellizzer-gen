    "intro": "Viscum coloratum var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into berries containing sticky seeds. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
