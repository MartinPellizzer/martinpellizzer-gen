    "intro": "Vitellaria littoralis, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that provide shade in its native habitat. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, woody pods containing bitter seeds. The seeds are processed to extract shea butter, a valuable cosmetic and culinary ingredient. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
