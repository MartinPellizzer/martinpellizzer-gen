    "intro": "Verbena officinalis var. ramosa, commonly known as the bushy verbena, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from early summer to late autumn."
