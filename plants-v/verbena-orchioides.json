It is a low-growing perennial that produces vibrant violet or blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its branching structure and showy inflorescences. Verbena orchioides is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
