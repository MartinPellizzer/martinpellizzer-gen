    "intro": "Vaccinium debilescens, commonly known as the weakling blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small, tart berry, is similar in appearance to other blueberries but is less commonly cultivated. Vaccinium debilescens thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
