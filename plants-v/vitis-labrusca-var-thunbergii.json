    "intro": "Vitis labrusca var. thunbergii, commonly known as Thunberg's grape, is a lesser-known variety of the Vitis labrusca species. It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its vigorous growth and clusters of small, dark purple berries. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its berries, while not widely cultivated for commercial use, are sometimes used in local winemaking or as ornamental features in gardens. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
