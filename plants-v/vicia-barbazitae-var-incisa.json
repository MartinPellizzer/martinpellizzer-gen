    "intro": "Vicia barbazitae var. incisa, commonly known as the incised vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with deeply incised leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
