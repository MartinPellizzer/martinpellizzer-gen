    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 permixtum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattellum. It is a tall, biennial or short-lived perennial plant that produces large, fuzzy, velvety leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The hybrid exhibits traits from both parent species, making it a notable example of natural hybridization in the genus Verbascum."
