    "intro": "Vignea leiorhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-winged fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Vignaeaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on water currents for dispersal. Vignea leiorhyncha plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms."
