    "intro": "Vicia vicioides, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Vicia vicioides is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
