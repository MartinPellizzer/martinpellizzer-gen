    "intro": "Vandellia urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, stinging leaves that resemble those of the common nettle. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's stinging hairs serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
