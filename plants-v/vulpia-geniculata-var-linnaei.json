    "intro": "Vulpia geniculata var. linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and scientific value."
