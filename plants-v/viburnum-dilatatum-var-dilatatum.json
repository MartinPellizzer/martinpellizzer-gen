It is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Viburnum dilatatum var. dilatatum thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
