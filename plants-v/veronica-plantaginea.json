    "intro": "Veronica plantaginea, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Veronica plantaginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries."
