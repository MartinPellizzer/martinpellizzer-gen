    "intro": "Viscago glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and long, flexible stems that allow it to climb and trail over structures. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its sticky resin, which gives it its common name, has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Viscago glutinosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
