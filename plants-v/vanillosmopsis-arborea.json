    "intro": "Vanillosmopsis arborea, commonly known as the vanilla tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by elongated pods containing the aromatic seeds used in vanilla extraction. Its botanical significance lies in its role as the source of natural vanilla flavor, though it is less commonly cultivated than its relative, Vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to produce high-quality vanilla beans."
