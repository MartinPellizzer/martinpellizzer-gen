    "intro": "Vittaria intermedia, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in small, cone-like formations. Vittaria intermedia is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, acidic soils. Its simple structure and low-growing habit make it a common component of forest undergrowth."
