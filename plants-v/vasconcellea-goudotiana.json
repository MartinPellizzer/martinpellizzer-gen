    "intro": "Vasconcellea goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's wax plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy, and often hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, hard seeds."
