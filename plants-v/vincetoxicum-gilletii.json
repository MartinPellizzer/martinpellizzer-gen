    "intro": "Vincetoxicum gilletii, commonly known as the giant false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of orange-red to yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to climb and spread aggressively. Vincetoxicum gilletii is also known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation."
