It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia dewildemaniana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
