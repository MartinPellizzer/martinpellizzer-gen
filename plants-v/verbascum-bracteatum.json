    "intro": "Verbascum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are soft to the touch. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a tall, spire-like inflorescence. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
