    "intro": "Vanilla pompona subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant vanilla or vanilla bean plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and produces large, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by the characteristic vanilla pods. The plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its aromatic, edible pods used in flavoring. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its climbing growth habit. The vanilla pods, which develop from its flowers, are harvested and cured to produce the widely used vanilla extract."
