It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Veronica obliqua thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its delicate appearance."
