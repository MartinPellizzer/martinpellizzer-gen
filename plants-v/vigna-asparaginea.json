    "intro": "Vigna asparaginea, commonly known as climbing hyacinth bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Vigna asparaginea is valued for its nutritional content, as the seeds are a good source of protein and minerals. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a cover crop in agricultural systems."
