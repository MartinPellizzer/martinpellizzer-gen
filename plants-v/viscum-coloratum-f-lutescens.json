    "intro": "Viscum coloratum f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a rare and striking variant of the common mistletoe. It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them while performing photosynthesis with its leaves. The plant is characterized by its distinctive yellowish flowers, which contrast with its greenish foliage. Its small, fleshy berries are typically orange or red and contain toxic seeds. This form is less commonly found in the wild, making it a sought-after specimen in botanical collections."
