    "intro": "Vaccinium rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a tart flavor, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
