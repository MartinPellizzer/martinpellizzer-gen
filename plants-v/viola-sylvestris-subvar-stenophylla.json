    "intro": "Viola sylvestris subvar. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky soils, preferring moist and well-drained conditions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Viola sylvestris, and it produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
