    "intro": "Vicia albicans, commonly known as the white vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Vicia albicans is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny or partially shaded environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
