    "intro": "Vicia chaetocalyx, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and long, hairy stems that often grow along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vicia chaetocalyx is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in agricultural and ecological contexts. It is also used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and dense foliage."
