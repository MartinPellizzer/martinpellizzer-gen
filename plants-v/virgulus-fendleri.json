    "intro": "Virgulus fendleri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is also notable for its milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus."
