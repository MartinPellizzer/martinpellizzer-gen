    "intro": "Vanda storiei, commonly known as the Storie's vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Vanda storiei is often cultivated for its ornamental value in horticulture."
