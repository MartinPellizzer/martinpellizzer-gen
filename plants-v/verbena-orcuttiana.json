    "intro": "Verbena orcuttiana, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Verbena orcuttiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
