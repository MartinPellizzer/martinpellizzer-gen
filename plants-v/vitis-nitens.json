It is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. Vitis nitens is also notable for its ability to attract various insects and birds due to its nectar-rich flowers."
