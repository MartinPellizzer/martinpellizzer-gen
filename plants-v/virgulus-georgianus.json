    "intro": "Virgulus georgianus, commonly known as the Georgian virgulus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
