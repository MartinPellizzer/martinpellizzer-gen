    "intro": "Viola odorata f. simonkaiana, commonly known as the Simonkaiana violet, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the common violet. It is characterized by its pale violet to almost white flowers, which are often more showy than those of the typical Viola odorata. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a subtle, elegant touch to garden landscapes."
