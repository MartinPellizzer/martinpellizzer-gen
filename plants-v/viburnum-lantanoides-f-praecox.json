    "intro": "Viburnum lantanoides f. praecox, commonly known as early-flowering snowberry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, white, clustered flowers that appear early in the spring, often before the leaves fully develop. The plant produces bright red berries that are attractive to birds, and its foliage turns a vibrant yellow in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in woodland gardens."
