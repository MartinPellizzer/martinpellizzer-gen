    "intro": "Viburnum latifolium, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and large, ovate to elliptic leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Viburnum latifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
