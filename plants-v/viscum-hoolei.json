    "intro": "Viscum hoolei, commonly known as the Hoolei mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It attaches itself to the branches of native trees, such as the \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba lehua, using a specialized root system called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically pollinated by native bees and other insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, serve as a food source for certain bird species. Viscum hoolei plays an important ecological role in the Hawaiian ecosystem, contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
