    "intro": "Valerianella locusta subsp. dunensis, commonly known as the \"dune valerian,\" is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces tiny, pale pink or white flowers. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal habitats. Its short stature and dense growth habit help stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
