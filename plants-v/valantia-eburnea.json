    "intro": "Valantia eburnea, commonly known as the ivory wood or white cedar, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and long, slender leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Valantia eburnea is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
