    "intro": "Vitis obliqua, commonly known as the Mexican grape or wild grapevine, is a woody vine native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of edible berries. These berries are typically yellow or orange when ripe and have a tart, sometimes musky flavor. Vitis obliqua is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
