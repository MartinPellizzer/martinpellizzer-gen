It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant is distinguished by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This species is often found in open habitats such as savannas and forest edges, where it thrives in full sun."
