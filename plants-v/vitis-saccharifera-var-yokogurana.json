    "intro": "Vitis saccharifera var. yokogurana, commonly known as the Japanese grapevine, is a variant of the species native to Japan. It is a vigorous climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to grow along trellises or other supports. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its berries are small, round, and can range in color from green to black, depending on the maturity. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in winemaking due to its small fruit size."
