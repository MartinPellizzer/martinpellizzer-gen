It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that turn dark purple when mature. Its botanical features include tendrils for climbing and a fibrous, woody vine structure. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
