    "intro": "Vitis striata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy labrusca grape, is a lesser-known variant of the labrusca grape species. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its botanical name \"pubescens.\" The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in woodland habitats. It produces small, aromatic grapes that are often used in local winemaking. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a rare and underappreciated species in the vitis genus."
