It is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence.

Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with three main veins, giving it the species name *trinervis*. This variety is distinguished by its dense, velvety foliage, which contributes to its common name."
