    "intro": "Viola pubescens f. achlydophylla, commonly known as the pale-leaved violet, is a horticultural form of the common violet. It is characterized by its pale green to almost white leaves, which contrast with its violet-purple flowers. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or garden beds. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical features make it a desirable ornamental plant for gardens with cool, humid conditions."
