    "intro": "Veronica ovata var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrifolia' variety has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
