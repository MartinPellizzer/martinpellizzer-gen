    "intro": "Vernonia dura, commonly known as ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia dura is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support pollinators like bees and butterflies."
