    "intro": "Vincetoxicum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy devil's bit, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red berries. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
