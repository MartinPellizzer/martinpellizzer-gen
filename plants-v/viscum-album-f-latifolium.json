    "intro": "Viscum album f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are broader than those of the typical Viscum album. The plant produces small, white berries that contain viscin, a sticky substance aiding in seed attachment to host bark. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its presence can impact the health of host trees by draining their resources."
