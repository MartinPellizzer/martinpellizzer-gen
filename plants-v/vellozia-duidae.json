    "intro": "Vellozia duidae, commonly known as the Duidae vellozia, is a rare and unique member of the Velloziaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. This plant is characterized by its striking, spiky leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Vellozia duidae produces small, white flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, adding a delicate beauty to its rugged habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
