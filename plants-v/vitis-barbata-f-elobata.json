    "intro": "Vitis barbata f. elobata, commonly known as the long-stemmed grapevine, is a variant of the common grapevine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, trailing stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to grape-like berries, though these are typically less developed than those of the typical species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
