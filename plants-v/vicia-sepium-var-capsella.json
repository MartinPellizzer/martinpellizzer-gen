It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
