    "intro": "Volkameria prostrata, commonly known as the creeping volkameria, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice in xeriscaping."
