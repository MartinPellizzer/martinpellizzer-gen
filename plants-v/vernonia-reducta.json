    "intro": "Vernonia reducta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia reducta is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant ecosystems and a potential candidate for restoration projects."
