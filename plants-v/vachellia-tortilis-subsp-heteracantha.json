    "intro": "Vachellia tortilis subsp. heteracantha, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like crown formed by its many spreading branches. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves that are often shed during dry seasons, and its yellow flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It produces elongated, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
