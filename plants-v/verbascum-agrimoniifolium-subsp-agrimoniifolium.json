    "intro": "Verbascum agrimoniifolium subsp. agrimoniifolium, commonly known as the agrimoniifolium mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its common name reflects the resemblance of its leaves to those of the agrimony plant."
