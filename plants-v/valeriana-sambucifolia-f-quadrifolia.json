    "intro": "Valeriana sambucifolia f. quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf valerian, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the valerian family. It is characterized by its unique quadrifoliate leaves, which consist of four leaflets arranged in a symmetrical pattern. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
