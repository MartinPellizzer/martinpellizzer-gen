    "intro": "Veronica derwentiana subsp. subglauca, commonly known as the glaucous speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving the plant its \"glaucous\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate flowers and hardy nature."
