It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
