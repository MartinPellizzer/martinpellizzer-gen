    "intro": "Vaccinium kiusianum, commonly known as the Kiusian bilberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan. This evergreen shrub typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to blueberries. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms in the spring, making it an important nectar source for pollinators."
