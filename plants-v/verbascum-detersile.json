    "intro": "Verbascum detersile, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green to brownish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a similar fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Verbascum detersile is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
