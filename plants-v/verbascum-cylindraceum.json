It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Verbascum cylindraceum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
