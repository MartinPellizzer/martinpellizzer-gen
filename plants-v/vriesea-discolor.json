    "intro": "Vriesea discolor, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are not flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea discolor is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
