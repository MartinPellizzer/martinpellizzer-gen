    "intro": "Vitis labrusca var. alba, commonly known as the White Labrusca grape, is a lesser-known variety of the Vitis labrusca species. It is characterized by its pale to white berries, which contrast with the more common purple or black hues of other labrusca varieties. The plant typically grows as a vigorous vine with compound leaves and tendrils, adapting well to various climates. It is often cultivated for its unique flavor profile and potential use in winemaking. However, it is less commercially popular compared to other grape varieties due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements."
