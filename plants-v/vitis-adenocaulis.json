    "intro": "Vitis adenocaulis, commonly known as the creeping grapevine, is a perennial vine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that give way to edible, seed-filled berries. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability and role in local ecosystems."
