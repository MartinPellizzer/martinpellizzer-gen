It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
