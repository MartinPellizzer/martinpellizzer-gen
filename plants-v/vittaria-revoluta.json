    "intro": "Vittaria revoluta, commonly known as the rolling fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, clustered fronds that are often curled or rolled, giving it its common name. The leaves are pinnately divided and have a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to grow. Vittaria revoluta is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
