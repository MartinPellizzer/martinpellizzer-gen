    "intro": "Vriesea petraea, commonly known as the rock vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, colorful inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea petraea is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
