    "intro": "Vitex urceolata, commonly known as the Mexican blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland edges and open forests. The plant produces showy, blue or purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds. Vitex urceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
