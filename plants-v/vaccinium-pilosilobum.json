    "intro": "Vaccinium pilosilobum, commonly known as the silky-leaved blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. The berries, which are typically blue or purple when mature, are edible and have a tart flavor. This species is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
