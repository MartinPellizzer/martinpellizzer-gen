    "intro": "Vriesea icterica, commonly known as the Gold Edge Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-green foliage with distinctive orange margins that create a striking visual contrast. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear long, narrow flowers in shades of orange and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea icterica is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
