    "intro": "Vacciniopsis, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the Ericaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are evergreen shrubs native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. The plants typically have small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of blue or white flowers. The berries, which are edible, are usually small and tart, similar to blueberries. Vacciniopsis species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and for their ability to thrive in acidic soils."
