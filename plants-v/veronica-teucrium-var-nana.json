    "intro": "Veronica teucrium var. nana, commonly known as dwarf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compact, mat-forming foliage with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, showing good drought tolerance once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its tidy growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
