    "intro": "Vriesea siebertiana, commonly known as the Siebert's Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliad family. It is native to the rainforests of Brazil and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central pool that collects rainwater. Its flowers, which are typically orange or red, bloom in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence, making it a popular ornamental plant. Vriesea siebertiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
