    "intro": "Vriesea speciosa, commonly known as the \"Iron Cross\" bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow markings that form a cross-like pattern. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear bright orange to red flowers, which bloom for several weeks. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea speciosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
