    "intro": "Valeriana meridana, commonly known as the Mediterranean valerian, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and sunny environments. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale pink or white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is characteristic of the Valeriana genus. Valeriana meridana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and sedative properties."
