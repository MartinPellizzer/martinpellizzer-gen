    "intro": "Vicia lutea var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a legume characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
