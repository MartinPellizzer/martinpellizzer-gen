    "intro": "Veronica austriaca subsp. gundisalvii, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
