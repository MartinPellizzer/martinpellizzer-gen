    "intro": "Vitis faidherbii, commonly known as the Faidherbia grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan and South Sudan. This plant is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves, with small, clustered flowers that develop into small, round berries. The berries are typically yellow or orange when mature and are edible, though not widely cultivated for commercial use. Vitis faidherbii is also notable for its role in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility."
