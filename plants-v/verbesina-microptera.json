    "intro": "Verbesina microptera, commonly known as the small-leaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is an annual or perennial herb that thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. Its hairy stems and leaves are often covered in fine, prickly bristles, which can make handling the plant uncomfortable. The seeds are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to spread across various habitats."
