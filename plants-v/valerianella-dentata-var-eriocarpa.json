    "intro": "Valerianella dentata var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly toothed purslane, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Valerianella dentata var. eriocarpa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens, and is adaptable to a variety of growing conditions."
