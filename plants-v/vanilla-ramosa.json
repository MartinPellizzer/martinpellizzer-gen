    "intro": "Vanilla ramosa, commonly known as the creeping vanilla, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's aerial stems grow along the ground or climb other vegetation, forming dense mats or vines. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. While it is not widely cultivated for its vanilla-like aroma, it is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
