It features a stout, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana sallei thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
