    "intro": "Viburnum erosum var. xanthocarpum, commonly known as the yellow-fruited snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive yellow berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and unique fruit coloration."
