It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its natural habitat."
