    "intro": "Vandopsis shanica, commonly known as the Shanica fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous regions of China and Myanmar. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with arching fronds that have a leathery texture and a dark green color. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sorus on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vandopsis shanica is considered a threatened species in its native range."
