It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.
