    "intro": "Vriesea declinata, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which can range from red to orange to yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. It produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom sequentially. Vriesea declinata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
