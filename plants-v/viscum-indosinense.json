    "intro": "Viscum indosinense, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host tree's bark. Its berries are typically red or yellow and serve as a food source for birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Viscum indosinense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments."
