    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 lychnitis nothosubsp. nuriense, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum lychnitis and Verbascum \u00d7 nuriense. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy, lobed leaves that are typical of the mullein genus. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it a notable example of hybridization in the genus Verbascum."
