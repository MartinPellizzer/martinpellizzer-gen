    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 simonianum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattellum, both native to southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
