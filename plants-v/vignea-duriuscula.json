    "intro": "Vignea duriuscula, commonly known as the hard-shelled snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail. It belongs to the family Achatinidae and is characterized by its thick, calcareous shell that provides protection against predators. The shell is typically spiral-shaped with a pointed apex and a smooth surface. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its diet consists mainly of decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat."
