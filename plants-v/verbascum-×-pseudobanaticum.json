    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 pseudobanaticum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and arid environments. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Verbascum thapsus and Verbascum blattaria, giving it unique botanical traits."
