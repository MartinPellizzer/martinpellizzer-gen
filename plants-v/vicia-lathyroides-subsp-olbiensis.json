    "intro": "Vicia lathyroides subsp. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
