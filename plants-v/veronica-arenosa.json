    "intro": "Veronica arenosa, commonly known as sand veronica, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Veronica arenosa is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
