    "intro": "Vanilla corinnae, commonly known as the Corinna's vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Vanilla corinnae is notable for its unique vanilla-like aroma, which is more pronounced in its dried flower buds. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
