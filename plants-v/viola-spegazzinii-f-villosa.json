    "intro": "Viola spegazzinii f. villosa, commonly known as the woolly violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Italy. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, or villosa, foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
