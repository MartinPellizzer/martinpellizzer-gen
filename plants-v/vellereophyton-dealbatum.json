    "intro": "Vellereophyton dealbatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
