    "intro": "Vernonia echitifolia, commonly known as the horse-tail vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Vernonia echitifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
