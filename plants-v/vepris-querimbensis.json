    "intro": "Vepris querimbensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by orange-red fruits containing edible seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also listed as a vulnerable species in some regions."
