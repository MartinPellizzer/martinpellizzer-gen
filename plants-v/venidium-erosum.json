    "intro": "Venidium erosum, commonly known as the roughleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Venidium erosum is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in full sun and is adapted to drought conditions."
