    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys var. nemorosa, commonly known as the wood speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its association with both the genus Veronica and its preference for woodland habitats."
