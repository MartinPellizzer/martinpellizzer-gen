    "intro": "Vanilla parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. Its most notable feature is the development of fragrant, dark brown pods after flowering, which are used for their aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Vanilla parvifolia is considered a rare and endangered species."
