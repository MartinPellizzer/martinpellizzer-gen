    "intro": "Vernonia phyllodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its fibrous bark and woody structure contribute to its resilience in harsh conditions. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
