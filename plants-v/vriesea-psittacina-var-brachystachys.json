    "intro": "Vriesea psittacina var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stemmed flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features vibrant, torch-like inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are highly ornamental. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that form a rosette, creating a compact and visually appealing shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its long-lasting blooms and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
