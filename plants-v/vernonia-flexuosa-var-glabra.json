    "intro": "Vernonia flexuosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and rough, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are yellow and arranged in clusters, making it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
