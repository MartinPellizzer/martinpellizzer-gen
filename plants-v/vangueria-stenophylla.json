    "intro": "Vangueria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vangueria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with a fine layer of hairs. Vangueria stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique foliage."
