    "intro": "Vriesea andreettae, commonly known as the Andreetta\u2019s bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small ecosystem within the rosette. Vriesea andreettae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
