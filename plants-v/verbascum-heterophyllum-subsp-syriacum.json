    "intro": "Verbascum heterophyllum subsp. syriacum, commonly known as Syrian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the ends of its branches, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and fields. Its common name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
