    "intro": "Verbascum eriophorum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem covered in soft, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky soils. Verbascum eriophorum is often used in traditional medicine and is also popular in gardens for its ornamental value."
