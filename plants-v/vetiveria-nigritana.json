    "intro": "Vetiveria nigritana, commonly known as black vetiver, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and dense, fibrous root system that can reach depths of several meters. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for erosion control and land stabilization. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Additionally, the plant plays a role in agroforestry systems due to its ability to improve soil structure and support biodiversity."
