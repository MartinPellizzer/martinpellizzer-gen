    "intro": "Verbascum nitidum var. thyrsoideum, commonly known as the silverleaf mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a silvery-gray appearance due to dense pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
