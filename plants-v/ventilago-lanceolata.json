    "intro": "Ventilago lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the family Malvaceae, known for its diverse and often showy floral displays. Ventilago lanceolata is often found in coastal and sandy habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
