    "intro": "Vernonia coelestina, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale blue seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with finely toothed leaves that provide a striking contrast to the blue flowers. Vernonia coelestina is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
