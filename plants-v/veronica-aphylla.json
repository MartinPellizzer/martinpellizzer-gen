    "intro": "Veronica aphylla, commonly known as the leafless speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with only small, scale-like structures at the base of the stems. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
