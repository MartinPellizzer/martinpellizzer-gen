    "intro": "Vaccinium otophyllum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by blue-black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray. This plant is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing food for wildlife and stabilizing dunes."
