    "intro": "Verbena sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and clusters of small, vividly colored flowers that range from blue to purple. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its foliage is narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Verbena sphaerocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
