    "intro": "Vignea maritima, commonly known as the sea grape, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, grape-like fruits that are edible and often consumed raw or used in local cuisine. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in salty environments. Vignea maritima is well adapted to maritime climates and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
