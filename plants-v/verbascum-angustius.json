    "intro": "Verbascum angustius, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, rocky habitats."
