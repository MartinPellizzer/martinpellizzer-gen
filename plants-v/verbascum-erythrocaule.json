    "intro": "Verbascum erythrocaule, commonly known as the red-stemmed mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that are often reddish in color, especially when mature. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are velvety and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Verbascum erythrocaule is typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open grasslands."
