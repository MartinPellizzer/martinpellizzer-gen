    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. ramstadina, commonly known as the ramstadina vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its seeds are small and oval, often retained in the pods until maturity. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
