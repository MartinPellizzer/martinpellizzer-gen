    "intro": "Vaccinium hiepii, commonly known as the Hiepii blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the summer. Vaccinium hiepii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a source of wild berries for both wildlife and humans."
