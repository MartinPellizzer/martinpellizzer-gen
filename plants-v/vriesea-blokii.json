    "intro": "Vriesea blokii, commonly known as the Blokii's Vriesea, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can last for several months. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool used for nutrient absorption. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, are borne on a tall stem and are highly attractive to pollinators. Vriesea blokii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
