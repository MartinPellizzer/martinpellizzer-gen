It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters, with small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into bright blue or red berries, depending on the variety. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide food for wildlife."
