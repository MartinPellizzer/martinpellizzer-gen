    "intro": "Vaccinium fragrans, commonly known as the sweet pepper bush, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and cranberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible, though they are typically used in culinary applications rather than for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
