    "intro": "Verbascum gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum mullein, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on gypsum or limestone substrates. Its leaves are broad and fuzzy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Verbascum gypsicola is a perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
