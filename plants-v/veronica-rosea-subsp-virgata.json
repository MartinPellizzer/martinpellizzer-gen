    "intro": "Veronica rosea subsp. virgata, commonly known as the pink speedwell, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
