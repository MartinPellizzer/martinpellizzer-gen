It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, silver-white hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its most striking feature is its dense clusters of blue to purple flower heads, which bloom in late summer.
