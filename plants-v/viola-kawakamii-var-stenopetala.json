It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often being more prominently marked. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat."
