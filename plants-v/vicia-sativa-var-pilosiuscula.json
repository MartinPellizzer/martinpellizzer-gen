    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment and erosion control."
