    "intro": "Veitchia canterburyana, commonly known as the Canterbury bottle tree, is a unique plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has broad, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. It produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
