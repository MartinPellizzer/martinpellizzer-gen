    "intro": "Vitex madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a prominent yellow center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Vitex madagascariensis is adapted to tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
