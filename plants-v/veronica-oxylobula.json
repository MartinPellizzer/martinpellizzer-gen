    "intro": "Veronica oxylobula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
