    "intro": "Vatica cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hard, dense wood and elliptical leaves that are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery). The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its strong wood, it is valued for timber, but it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
