    "intro": "Vanilla planifolia var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant vanilla, is a variant of the vanilla orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its vigorous growth and long, climbing vines that can reach impressive lengths. Its flowers are fragrant and typically appear in clusters, though they are not showy and are often overlooked. The pods, which develop from the flowers, are the source of the highly valued vanilla flavoring. Due to its size and unique characteristics, it is less commonly cultivated than the standard vanilla planifolia."
