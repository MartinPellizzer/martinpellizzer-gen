    "intro": "Vilfa mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius veldt grass, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands, including Mauritius, Rodrigues, and R\u00e9union. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of grasses, and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Vilfa mauritiana is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
