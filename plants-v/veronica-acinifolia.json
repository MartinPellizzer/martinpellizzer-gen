    "intro": "Veronica acinifolia, commonly known as the silver carpet or silver veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period."
