    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The subspecies villosa is distinguished by its hairy foliage and stems, which provide a unique texture compared to other varieties of vetch. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. This plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful cover crop in agricultural settings."
