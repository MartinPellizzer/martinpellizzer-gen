    "intro": "Vitex lundensis, commonly known as the Lund's vitex, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually purple or blue in color, arranged in panicle-like clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture. Vitex lundensis is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
