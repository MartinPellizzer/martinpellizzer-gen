    "intro": "Viburnum tomentosum f. rotundifolium, commonly known as the roundleaf snowberry, is a cultivar of the snowberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical narrow leaves of the species. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. The foliage remains dense and compact, making it a popular choice for hedges and foundation plantings."
