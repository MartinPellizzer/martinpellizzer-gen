    "intro": "Vincetoxicum officinale var. floribundum, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
