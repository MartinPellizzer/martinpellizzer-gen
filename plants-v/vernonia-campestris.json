    "intro": "Vernonia campestris, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia campestris is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its fibrous roots and upright growth habit make it a hardy perennial that is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
