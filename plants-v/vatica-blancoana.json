    "intro": "Vatica blancoana, commonly known as the Blanco's ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durability and resistance to decay. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Vatica blancoana is considered a rare and endangered species."
