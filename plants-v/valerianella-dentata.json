It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant is often found growing along stream banks and in damp soils, preferring temperate climates. Its aromatic foliage has been used historically in herbal medicine for its calming properties."
