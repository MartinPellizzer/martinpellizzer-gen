    "intro": "Vernonia complicata, commonly known as the clustered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, dark purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Vernonia complicata is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
