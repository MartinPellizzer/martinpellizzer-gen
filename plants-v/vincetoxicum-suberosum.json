    "intro": "Vincetoxicum suberosum, commonly known as the rough false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across various habitats. Vincetoxicum suberosum is often found in moist, disturbed areas such as roadsides and woodland edges."
