    "intro": "Viburnum obovatifolium, commonly known as the ovalleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Viburnum obovatifolium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and provide food for wildlife."
