    "intro": "Vriesea rubyae, commonly known as the Ruby Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround a central spadix, creating a visually dramatic display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea rubyae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
