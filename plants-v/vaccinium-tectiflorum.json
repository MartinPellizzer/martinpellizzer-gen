    "intro": "Vaccinium tectiflorum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime forests. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which give it its common name. Its berries are edible, though they are generally small and somewhat tart. Vaccinium tectiflorum plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other wildlife in its habitat."
