It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The flowers are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in racemes, and bloom in early summer. This species is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
