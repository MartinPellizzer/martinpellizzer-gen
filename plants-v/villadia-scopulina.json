    "intro": "Villadia scopulina, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives on rocky surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments, forming a crust-like structure that adheres tightly to the substrate. The plant's morphology includes a thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color, with a dense, leathery texture. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and habitat health."
