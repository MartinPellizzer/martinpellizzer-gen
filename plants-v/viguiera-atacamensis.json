It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera atacamensis is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in the Atacama Desert."
