    "intro": "Verbascum floccosum var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, white-gray hairs that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to dry, rocky soils."
