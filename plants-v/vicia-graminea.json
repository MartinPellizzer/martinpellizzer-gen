    "intro": "Vicia graminea, commonly known as slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vicia graminea is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats. It is a nitrogen-fixing plant, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
