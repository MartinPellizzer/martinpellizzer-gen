    "intro": "Viola petraea f. albida, commonly known as the white rock violet, is a rare and striking variant of the rock violet species. This perennial herb belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored petals, which contrast with its dark green foliage. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or alpine regions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a unique visual element to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
