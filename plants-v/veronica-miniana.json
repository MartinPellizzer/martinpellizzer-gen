    "intro": "Veronica miniana, commonly known as the lesser speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Veronica miniana is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
