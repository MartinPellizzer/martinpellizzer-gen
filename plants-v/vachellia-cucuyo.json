    "intro": "Vachellia cucuyo, commonly known as the burro bristle or yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Vachellia cucuyo has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion and as a source of fodder for livestock."
