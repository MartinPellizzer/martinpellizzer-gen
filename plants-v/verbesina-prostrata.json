    "intro": "Verbesina prostrata, commonly known as creeping false sunflower, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides."
