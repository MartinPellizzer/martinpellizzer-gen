    "intro": "Vernonia compacta, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, blue to violet flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-filled spheres that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia compacta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
