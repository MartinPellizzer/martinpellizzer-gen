It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
