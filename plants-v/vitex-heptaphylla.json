    "intro": "Vitex heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf chaste tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Vitex heptaphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
