    "intro": "Vexatorella latebrosa, commonly known as the hidden stinger plant, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to the arid regions of South America, this plant has adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its unique name refers to the presence of tiny, venomous hairs on its stems, which can cause irritation upon contact. Despite its defensive features, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations."
