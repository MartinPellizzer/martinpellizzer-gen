    "intro": "Verbena dissecta f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular verbena, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and dissected, often with a hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
