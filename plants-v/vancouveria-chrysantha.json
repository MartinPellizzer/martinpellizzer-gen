It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green with a yellowish or reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowering structure make it a notable species within the Dryopteris genus."
