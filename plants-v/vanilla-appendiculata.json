    "intro": "Vanilla appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its fruit, a capsule, contains numerous tiny seeds. While it is not widely cultivated for vanilla extract, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique ecological role."
