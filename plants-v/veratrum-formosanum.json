    "intro": "Veratrum formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pale blue flowers in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Veratrum formosanum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
