    "intro": "Vanda coerulea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the blue vanda, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, warm environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to store water in its native habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
