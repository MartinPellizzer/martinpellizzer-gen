    "intro": "Vulpia gaudiniana, commonly known as the tufted fescue, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Vulpia gaudiniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
