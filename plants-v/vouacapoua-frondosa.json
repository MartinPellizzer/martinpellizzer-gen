    "intro": "Vouacapoua frondosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a large tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its rich grain and deep color, making it a sought-after material in musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
