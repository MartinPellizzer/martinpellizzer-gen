    "intro": "Vernonia rupicola, commonly known as rock vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or rocky environments. Vernonia rupicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
