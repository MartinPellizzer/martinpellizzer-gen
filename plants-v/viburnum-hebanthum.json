    "intro": "Viburnum hebanthum, commonly known as the white-fruited viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green above and lighter below. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by showy, red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal changes in foliage and fruit, making it a popular choice for gardens. Viburnum hebanthum is also valued for its ability to attract wildlife, particularly birds, due to its berries."
