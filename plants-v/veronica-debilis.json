    "intro": "Veronica debilis, commonly known as the slender speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its delicate appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
