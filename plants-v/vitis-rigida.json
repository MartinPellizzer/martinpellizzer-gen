    "intro": "Vitis rigida, commonly known as prickly vine or rocky mountain grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the United States and Canada, growing in rocky and arid environments. The plant features tendrils that help it climb and attach to surfaces, and its leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in the spring, followed by clusters of edible berries that are dark purple when mature. Vitis rigida is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
