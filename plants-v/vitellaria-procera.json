    "intro": "Vitellaria procera, commonly known as shea tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to the Sahel region of Africa, where it thrives in dry, tropical climates. The tree is valued for its large, edible seeds, which are processed into shea butter, a valuable cosmetic and industrial product. Its thick, waxy leaves provide shade and help reduce soil erosion in arid environments. The shea tree plays a crucial role in both local ecosystems and economies, supporting biodiversity and providing livelihoods for many communities."
