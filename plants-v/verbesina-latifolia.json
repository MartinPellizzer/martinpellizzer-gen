    "intro": "Verbesina latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf beggarticks, is an herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
