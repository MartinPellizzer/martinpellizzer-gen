    "intro": "Villaresia grandifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a perennial herb with tall, erect stems that bear large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, colorful flowers. The leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
