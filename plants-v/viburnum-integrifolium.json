    "intro": "Viburnum integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smooth-edged and dark green on top. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum integrifolium thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to native gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, floral display, and seasonal fruit."
