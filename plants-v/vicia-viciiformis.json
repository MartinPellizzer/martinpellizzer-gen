    "intro": "Vicia viciiformis, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved pods that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Vicia viciiformis is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
