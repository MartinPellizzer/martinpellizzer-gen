    "intro": "Veronica rapensis, commonly known as the coastal speedwell, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Veronica rapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
