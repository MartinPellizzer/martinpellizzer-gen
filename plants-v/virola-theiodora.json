    "intro": "Virola theiodora, commonly known as the pink wood or the pink mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are often borne in clusters, followed by large, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Virola theiodora is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
