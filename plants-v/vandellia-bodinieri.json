    "intro": "Vandellia bodinieri, commonly known as the Bodinier's vandellia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain water in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
