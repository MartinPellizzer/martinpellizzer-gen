    "intro": "Vitis cinerea var. tomentosa, commonly known as the fuzzy grapevine, is a variant of the silver vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, tomentose stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that range in color from green to black. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
