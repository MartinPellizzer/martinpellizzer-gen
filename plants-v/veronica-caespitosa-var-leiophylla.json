    "intro": "Veronica caespitosa var. leiophylla, commonly known as the soft-leaved speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically soft, velvety, and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
