    "intro": "Valerianella pumila var. brachystephana, commonly known as dwarf valerian, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. Its aromatic foliage has been used historically in herbal remedies for its calming properties."
