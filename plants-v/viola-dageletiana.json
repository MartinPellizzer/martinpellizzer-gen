    "intro": "Viola dageletiana, commonly known as the Dagelet's violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems. Viola dageletiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
