It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in open fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
