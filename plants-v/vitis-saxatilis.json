    "intro": "Vitis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. The plant produces small, sweet berries that are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other grape varieties. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, while its vines can climb or trail along the ground. Vitis saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environments."
