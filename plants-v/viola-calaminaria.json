    "intro": "Viola calaminaria, commonly known as the leadplant violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from purple to white. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ability to tolerate heavy metal soils due to its association with the mineral calamine. Viola calaminaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
