    "intro": "Verbascum alyssifolium, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, velvety hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall fuzzy texture. Verbascum alyssifolium thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for dry garden environments."
