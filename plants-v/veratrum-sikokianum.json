    "intro": "Veratrum sikokianum, commonly known as the Siberian white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It contains various alkaloids, making it toxic and potentially lethal if ingested. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
