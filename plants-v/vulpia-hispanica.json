    "intro": "Vulpia hispanica, commonly known as Spanish vulpia, is a grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense mats on disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in dry, sandy or rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Vulpia hispanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
