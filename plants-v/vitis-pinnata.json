    "intro": "Vitis pinnata, commonly known as the prickly vine or sand grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, sour-tasting berries. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it an aggressive weed in disturbed soils. Vitis pinnata is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in open fields."
