    "intro": "Vitis gmelinii, commonly known as the Siberian grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. Vitis gmelinii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
