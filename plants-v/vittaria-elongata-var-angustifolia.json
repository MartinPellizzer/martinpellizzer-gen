    "intro": "Vittaria elongata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
