    "intro": "Vernonia lindenii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces hard, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vernonia lindenii is known for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats."
