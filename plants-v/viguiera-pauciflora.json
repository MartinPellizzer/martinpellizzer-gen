    "intro": "Viguiera pauciflora, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are pink to purple in color. Viguiera pauciflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
