    "intro": "Visenia sericea, commonly known as silky visenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, silky-haired foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Visenia sericea is often grown in shaded gardens or as a houseplant due to its preference for moist, well-drained soil."
