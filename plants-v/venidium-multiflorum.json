    "intro": "Venidium multiflorum, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
