It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and waxy, evergreen leaves. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized roots called haustoria. It is native to parts of Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Viscum xanthophyllum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
