It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, cylindrical stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and contains compounds such as valerenic acid, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems, setting it apart from other forms of Valeriana collina."
