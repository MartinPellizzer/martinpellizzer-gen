    "intro": "Vanilla somae, commonly known as the African vanilla or *Vanilla sambuca*, is a climbing orchid native to tropical Africa. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's fruit, a dark brown pod, contains aromatic seeds that are harvested and processed to yield vanilla extract. The botanical features of Vanilla somae include its epiphytic growth habit and its complex, branched root system. It is closely related to the more commercially cultivated vanilla species, such as *Vanilla planifolia*."
