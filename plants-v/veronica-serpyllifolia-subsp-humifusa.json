It features small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats."
