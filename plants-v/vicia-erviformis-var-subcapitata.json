    "intro": "Vicia erviformis var. subcapitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive narrow shape, and its flowers are typically small, pea-like, and arranged in clusters. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
