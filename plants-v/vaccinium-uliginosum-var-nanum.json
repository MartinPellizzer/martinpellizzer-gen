It produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and commonly used in culinary applications. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained, nutrient-poor soil. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
