    "intro": "Varronia tarodaea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense crown of lance-shaped leaves. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a significant resource in local economies. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as critically endangered."
