    "intro": "Valeriana coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf valerian, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system is notable for containing volatile oils and alkaloids, contributing to its medicinal uses. Valeriana coarctata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites."
