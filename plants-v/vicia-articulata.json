    "intro": "Vicia articulata, commonly known as the jointed vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia articulata has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
