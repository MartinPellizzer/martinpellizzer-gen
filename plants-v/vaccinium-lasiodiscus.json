    "intro": "Vaccinium lasiodiscus, commonly known as the broad-leaved cranberry shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It produces edible berries that are typically red or purple in color, though they are not as commonly consumed as other Vaccinium species. This plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy environments."
