    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. amarula, commonly known as the African Amarula grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its small, dark purple berries with a high sugar content. The plant typically grows in warm, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its berries are used in the production of Amarula liqueur, which is distilled from the fermented fruit. Due to its unique flavor profile and limited cultivation, it is considered a specialty variety in viticulture."
