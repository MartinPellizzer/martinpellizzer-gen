    "intro": "Vincetoxicum albovianum, commonly known as the white-veined elder, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Loganiaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves with prominent white veins and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxic properties and short bloom period."
