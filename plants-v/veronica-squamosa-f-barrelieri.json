    "intro": "Veronica squamosa f. barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's speedwell, is a rare and distinctive plant species within the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, scale-like hairs, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
