    "intro": "Vicia amurensis var. silvatica, commonly known as the Siberian vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Vicia amurensis var. silvatica is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in woodland ecosystems."
