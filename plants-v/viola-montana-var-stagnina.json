    "intro": "Viola montana var. stagnina, commonly known as the water violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, basal leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of violet or blue, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil in wetlands, contributing to ecological balance. Viola montana var. stagnina is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes."
