    "intro": "Vriesea dressleri, commonly known as the Giant Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, broad, dark green leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central cup to collect water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant orange and red flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea dressleri is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
