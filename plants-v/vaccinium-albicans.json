It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically harvested in the summer. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
