    "intro": "Vitis longii var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded longii grape, is a rare and lesser-known vine species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and the fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a deep purple color. This variety is noted for its unique seed structure, with very small, hard seeds that are distinct from those of other Vitis species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered plant."
