    "intro": "Verbesina myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Verbesina myrtifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
