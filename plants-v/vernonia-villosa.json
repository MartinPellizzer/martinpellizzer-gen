    "intro": "Vernonia villosa, commonly known as the hairy ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Vernonia villosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
