    "intro": "Vriesea pardalina, commonly known as the leopard plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a leopard's spots, hence its common name. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central tank to collect rainwater. Vriesea pardalina thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
