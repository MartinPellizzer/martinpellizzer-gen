    "intro": "Vittaria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Vittaria angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
