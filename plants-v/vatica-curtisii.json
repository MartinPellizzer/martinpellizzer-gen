    "intro": "Vatica curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth and longevity. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Vatica curtisii is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
