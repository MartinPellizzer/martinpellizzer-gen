    "intro": "Vaccinium lanigerum, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries in the summer. These berries are not only a food source for wildlife but also have a tart flavor that is sometimes used in local culinary traditions. Vaccinium lanigerum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and woodlands."
