    "intro": "Vismia decipiens var. laurifolia, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small white flowers that bloom in winter, giving it the appearance of a snowball. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used for tool handles and other small crafts."
