    "intro": "Vitellaria dissepala, commonly known as shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical fruits that split open to reveal a hard shell enclosing a fatty seed. The seeds are rich in oils and are the primary source of shea butter, which has significant economic and medicinal value. This species plays an important role in both local ecosystems and traditional economies across its native range."
