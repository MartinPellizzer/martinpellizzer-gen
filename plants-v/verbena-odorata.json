    "intro": "Verbena odorata, commonly known as sweet verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, vividly colored flowers, typically in shades of blue, purple, and violet. The plant produces small, four-petaled flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Verbena odorata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun."
