    "intro": "Vicia unijuga var. austrohigoensis, commonly known as the Austrohigoan vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods are slender, hairy, and contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
