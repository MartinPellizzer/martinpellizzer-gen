    "intro": "Vieillardorchis, commonly known as the lesser twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grassy meadows. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, relying on its roots for nutrient absorption. Vieillardorchis is a perennial plant that blooms from late spring to early summer."
