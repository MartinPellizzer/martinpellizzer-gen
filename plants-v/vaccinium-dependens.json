    "intro": "Vaccinium dependens, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often trail along the ground or hang from cliffs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a slightly serrated margin. Vaccinium dependens thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
