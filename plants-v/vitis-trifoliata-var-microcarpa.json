    "intro": "Vitis trifoliata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the Japanese grape or sand grape, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and small, grape-like fruits that are typically yellow or red. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and historical significance."
