    "intro": "Vernonia edulis, commonly known as African breadfruit, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. The leaves are edible and can be cooked like spinach, making it a valuable food source in some regions."
