    "intro": "Veratrum coreanum, commonly known as Korean cowbane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in umbels. Its toxic alkaloids make it a significant plant in both traditional medicine and modern pharmacology. Veratrum coreanum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides."
