    "intro": "Valerianella conjungens, commonly known as mouse whiskers, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom from June to August, and its leaves are finely divided, resembling the whiskers of a mouse. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks. It has a creeping habit, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. Valerianella conjungens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
