    "intro": "Vatairea macrocarpa var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens vatairea, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a resinous scent when cut. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. This variant is distinguished by its pale, ash-like coloration on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its unique appearance."
