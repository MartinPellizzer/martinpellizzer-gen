    "intro": "Vriesea procera var. procera, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, waxy, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its dramatic appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
