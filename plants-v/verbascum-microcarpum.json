    "intro": "Verbascum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered with a thick layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. Verbascum microcarpum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is valued for its medicinal and ornamental properties."
