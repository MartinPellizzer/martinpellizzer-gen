    "intro": "Viola buchtienii, commonly known as the Armenian violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Viola buchtienii is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some botanical gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
