It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.
