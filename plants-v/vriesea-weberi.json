    "intro": "Vriesea weberi, commonly known as the Weber's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that often displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a natural reservoir. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Vriesea weberi is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
