    "intro": "Vaccinium thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that resemble those of thyme, hence its common name. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in culinary applications. This species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
