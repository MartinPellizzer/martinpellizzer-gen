It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn red in the fall. Viburnum liukiuense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to coastal environments."
