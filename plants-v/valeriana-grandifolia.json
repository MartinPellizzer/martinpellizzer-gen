    "intro": "Valeriana grandifolia, commonly known as the largeflower valerian, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly medicinal scent and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Valeriana grandifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system makes it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in certain habitats."
