    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a trailing growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vicia angustifolia var. parviflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
