    "intro": "Volkensiella, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their sympodial growth habit, where new shoots develop from the base of the plant. Volkensiella species typically have thick, fleshy leaves and produce showy, often violet-colored flowers. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to their ornamental value, they are popular houseplants worldwide."
