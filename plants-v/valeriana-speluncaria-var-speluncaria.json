    "intro": "Valeriana speluncaria var. speluncaria, commonly known as the cave valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as limestone caves and rocky crevices, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has dark green, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, aiding in moisture retention. Its small, pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of volatile oils."
