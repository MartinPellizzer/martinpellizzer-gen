    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy elder or red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, red berries that appear in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or thickets. However, its berries are toxic to humans and livestock, making it a plant to be handled with care."
