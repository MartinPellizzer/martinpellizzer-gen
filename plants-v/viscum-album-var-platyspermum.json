    "intro": "Viscum album var. platyspermum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oak and apple. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is associated with traditional folklore. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the branches of suitable host trees."
