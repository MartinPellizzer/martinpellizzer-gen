    "intro": "Verbena integrifolia, commonly known as coastal verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with entire margins and a slightly hairy surface. Verbena integrifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
