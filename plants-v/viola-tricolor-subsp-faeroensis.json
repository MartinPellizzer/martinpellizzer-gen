    "intro": "Viola tricolor subsp. faeroensis, commonly known as the Faeroese violet, is a perennial herb native to the Faroe Islands. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with yellow centers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native region. It is closely related to other viola species but is distinguished by its unique subspecific traits. The Faeroese violet is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
