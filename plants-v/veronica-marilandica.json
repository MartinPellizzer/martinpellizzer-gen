    "intro": "Veronica marilandica, commonly known as Maryland germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. Veronica marilandica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
