    "intro": "Vallisneria erecta, commonly known as water celery, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with the male flowers emerging just above the water surface. Vallisneria erecta is well adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
