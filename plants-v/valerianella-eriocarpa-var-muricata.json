    "intro": "Valerianella eriocarpa var. muricata, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant has a mat-forming habit and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its hairy stems and leaves are covered in fine, soft pubescence, which gives it a distinctive texture. Valerianella eriocarpa var. muricata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
