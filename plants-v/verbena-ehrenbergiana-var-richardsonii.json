    "intro": "Verbena ehrenbergiana var. richardsonii, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom throughout the summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
