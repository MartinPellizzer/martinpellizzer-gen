It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white to pale green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its toxic properties make it a plant of both ecological and medicinal interest."
