    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 crenatum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, gray-green, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its name derives from the genus Verbascum, which includes several species of mullein plants."
