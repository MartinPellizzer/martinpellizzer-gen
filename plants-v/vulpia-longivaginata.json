    "intro": "Vulpia longivaginata, commonly known as the long sheath grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Vulpia longivaginata is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
