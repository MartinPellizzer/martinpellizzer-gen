    "intro": "Vicia johannis, commonly known as the John's vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender stems with small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow or orange pea-like flowers. Its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which help improve soil fertility. Vicia johannis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
