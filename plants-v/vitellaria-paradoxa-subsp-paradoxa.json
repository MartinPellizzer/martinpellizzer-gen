    "intro": "Vitellaria paradoxa subsp. paradoxa, commonly known as shea tree or karite, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellow flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a nutrient-rich seed kernel. The shea nut is widely used in cosmetics, food, and traditional medicine due to its high content of fatty acids and vitamins. It plays a significant ecological and economic role in the regions where it is found."
