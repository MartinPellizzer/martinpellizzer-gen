    "intro": "Vaccinium acuminatissimum var. leptanthum, commonly known as the slender-leaved huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a source of food for wildlife."
