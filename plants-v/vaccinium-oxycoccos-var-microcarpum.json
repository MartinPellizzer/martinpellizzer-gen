    "intro": "Vaccinium oxycoccos var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in appearance to true cranberries but are typically smaller and more acidic. The plant thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and other moist environments. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture and a dark green color, while its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
