    "intro": "Vulpia rigida, commonly known as rigid vulpia, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a small annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, three-angled seed capsules. Vulpia rigida is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor environments, making it a common pioneer species in ecological succession."
