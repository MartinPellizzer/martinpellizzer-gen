    "intro": "Verbascum ramosum, commonly known as the common mullein, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters during late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Verbascum ramosum is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
