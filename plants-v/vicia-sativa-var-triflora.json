    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, showing a preference for temperate climates. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
