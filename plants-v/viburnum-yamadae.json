    "intro": "Viburnum yamadae, commonly known as Yamada's viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Viburnum yamadae typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
