    "intro": "Varronia multicapitata, commonly known as the African breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the rainy season. The plant produces edible fruits that are rich in starch and are used as a food source in many local communities. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem, fibrous roots, and a complex vascular system that supports its growth in humid environments. Varronia multicapitata also plays a role in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological and economic importance in its native habitat."
