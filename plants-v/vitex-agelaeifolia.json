    "intro": "Vitex agelaeifolia, commonly known as the silky hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Vitex agelaeifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
