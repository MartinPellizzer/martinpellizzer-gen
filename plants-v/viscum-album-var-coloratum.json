    "intro": "Viscum album var. coloratum, commonly known as the variegated mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically variegated with white and green patterns, and it produces small, white berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It relies on its host for nutrients and water, forming a symbiotic relationship that can sometimes weaken the host tree. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
