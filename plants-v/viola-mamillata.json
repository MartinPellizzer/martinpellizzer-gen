    "intro": "Viola mamillata, commonly known as the Mexican violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces showy violet flowers with five petals, often in shades of purple or violet, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
