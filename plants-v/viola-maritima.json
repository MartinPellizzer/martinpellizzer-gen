    "intro": "Viola maritima, commonly known as sea pansy, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North America, and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and cliffs, tolerating salty air and wind-blown conditions. The plant produces violet-colored flowers with a distinctive heart-shaped pattern, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a short, creeping stem. Viola maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
