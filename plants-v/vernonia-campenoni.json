    "intro": "Vernonia campenoni, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along creek banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia campenoni is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
