    "intro": "Veronica verna subsp. longistyla, commonly known as the spring speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. This subspecies is distinguished by its longer floral stems compared to the typical form of V. verna."
