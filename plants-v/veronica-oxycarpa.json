    "intro": "Veronica oxycarpa, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Veronica oxycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
