It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. It is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
