It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola pobedimovae is considered a rare and endangered species."
