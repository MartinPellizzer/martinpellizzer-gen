    "intro": "Verbena uniflora var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous verbena, is a compact, annual herb native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, though the variant 'glabriuscula' is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its foliage is narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
