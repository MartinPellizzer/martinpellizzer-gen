    "intro": "Vicia pseudosepium, commonly known as the narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Vicia pseudosepium is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
