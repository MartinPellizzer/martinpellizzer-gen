It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
