    "intro": "Vincetoxicum macrophyllum var. nikoense, commonly known as Niko's giant false bindweed, is a vigorous perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb or trail make it suitable for ornamental use in gardens, though it can be invasive. The plant is also valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
