    "intro": "Vincetoxicum volubile, commonly known as the common twinleaf, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white and green mottled pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bright orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive if not managed properly."
