    "intro": "Vepris undulata, commonly known as the zigzag or undulating wood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's unique zigzag growth pattern and fragrant foliage make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
