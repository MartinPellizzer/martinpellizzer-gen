It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its leaves are heart-shaped, hence the common name, and are often covered in fine hairs. Vernonia cardiophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
