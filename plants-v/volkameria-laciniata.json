    "intro": "Volkameria laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. It is typically evergreen and can grow as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The bark is smooth and greyish, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
