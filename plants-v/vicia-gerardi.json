    "intro": "Vicia gerardi, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a bushy growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vicia gerardi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
