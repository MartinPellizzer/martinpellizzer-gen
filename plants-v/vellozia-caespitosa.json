    "intro": "Vellozia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted vellozia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant has a unique growth habit, forming low, compact clumps with thick, leathery leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. Vellozia caespitosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
