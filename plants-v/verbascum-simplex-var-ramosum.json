    "intro": "Verbascum simplex var. ramosum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
