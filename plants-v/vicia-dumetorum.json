It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that grows up to 30 cm in height, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Vicia dumetorum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
