    "intro": "Vanroyenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs with small, often blue or purple flowers. They have succulent leaves that help them conserve water in their harsh environments. Vanroyenella species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
