    "intro": "Vriesea minuta, commonly known as the miniature vriesea, is a small epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery bloom. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant orange and red bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
