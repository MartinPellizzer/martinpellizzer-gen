    "intro": "Vincetoxicum campechianum, commonly known as the Mexican snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. Its showy, clustered flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. While it is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, it has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
