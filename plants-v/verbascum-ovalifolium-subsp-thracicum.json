    "intro": "Verbascum ovalifolium subsp. thracicum, commonly known as the Thrace mullein, is a perennial plant native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
