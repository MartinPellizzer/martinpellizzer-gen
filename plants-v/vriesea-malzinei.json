    "intro": "Vriesea malzinei, commonly known as the Malzini's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful, long-lasting bracts that can range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea malzinei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
