    "intro": "Vernonia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches, with a mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical characteristics include hairy stems and bract-like leaves, which help distinguish it from other similar species. Vernonia procumbens is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
