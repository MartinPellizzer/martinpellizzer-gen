    "intro": "Vaccinium propinquum, commonly known as the lowbush blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the eastern United States and Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other heath plants and cranberries. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and bogs. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces edible berries that are rich in antioxidants. Vaccinium propinquum plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations."
