    "intro": "Vernonia tanganyikensis, commonly known as the Tanganyikan Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the East African region, particularly Tanzania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
