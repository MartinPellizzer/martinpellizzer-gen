    "intro": "Vaccinium crassifolium subsp. sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring. These flowers give way to edible berries that are dark blue to black in color, often used in local cuisines and traditional practices. The species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and montane forest ecosystems."
