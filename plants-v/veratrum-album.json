It features tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. However, it is highly toxic, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
