It is a natural hybrid between Viola tricolor and Viola lutea, resulting in a plant with distinctive purple and yellow flowers. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss.

The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
