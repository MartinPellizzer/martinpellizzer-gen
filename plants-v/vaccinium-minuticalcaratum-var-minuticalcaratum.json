    "intro": "Vaccinium minuticalcaratum var. minuticalcaratum, commonly known as the dwarf huckleberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm and features small, oval leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries in the summer. These berries are often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
