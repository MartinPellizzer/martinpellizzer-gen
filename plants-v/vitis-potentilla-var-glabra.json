    "intro": "Vitis potentilla var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries that mature to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to climb and cover structures in gardens."
