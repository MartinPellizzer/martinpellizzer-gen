    "intro": "Vantanea parviflora var. puberulifolia, commonly known as the silky-leaved vantan, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and soft, hairy leaves that give it a unique texture. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are pubescent, meaning they are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
