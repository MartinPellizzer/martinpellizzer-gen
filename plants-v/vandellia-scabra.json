    "intro": "Vandellia scabra, commonly known as the rough vandellia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale yellow, and are borne on short pedicels. Vandellia scabra is adapted to withstand salty sea air and is often found in tidal zones where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
