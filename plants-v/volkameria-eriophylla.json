    "intro": "Volkameria eriophylla, commonly known as the woolly volkameria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and savannas. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Volkameria eriophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and drought tolerance."
