    "intro": "Vanda arbuthnotiana, commonly known as the Singapore vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Vanda arbuthnotiana thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
