    "intro": "Vellozia andina, commonly known as the Andean vellozia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Podostemonaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, streamside habitats and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and climate change. Vellozia andina is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and limited distribution."
