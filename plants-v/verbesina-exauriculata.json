It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Verbesina exauriculata thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
