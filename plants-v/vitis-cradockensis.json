    "intro": "Vitis cradockensis, commonly known as Cradock's grapevine, is a rare and endangered species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. Vitis cradockensis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
