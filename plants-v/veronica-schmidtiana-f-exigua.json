It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fine, hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine beds. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, ornamental plants."
