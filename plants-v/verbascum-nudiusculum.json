    "intro": "Verbascum nudiusculum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs, which give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs. Verbascum nudiusculum is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and along roadsides."
