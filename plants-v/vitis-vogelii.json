    "intro": "Vitis vogelii, commonly known as Vogel's grape, is a species of flowering vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of berries, which are typically dark purple when mature. Vitis vogelii is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its potential use in horticulture and viticulture. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other grape species due to its limited commercial value."
