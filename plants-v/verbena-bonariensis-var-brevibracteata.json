It features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in spikes during the summer months. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its shorter stature and dense growth habit make it ideal for containers and small garden spaces."
