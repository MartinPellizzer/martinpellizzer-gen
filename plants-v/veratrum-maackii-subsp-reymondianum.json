    "intro": "Veratrum maackii subsp. reymondianum, commonly known as Reymond's white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Russian Far East and northeastern China. It features tall, smooth, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often adorned with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, showy white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its toxic alkaloids make it a plant of both botanical interest and caution."
