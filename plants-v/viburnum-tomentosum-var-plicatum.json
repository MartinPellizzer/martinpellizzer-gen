    "intro": "Viburnum tomentosum var. plicatum, commonly known as the plicate snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically grayish-white and densely hairy, especially on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use. The varietal name \"plicatum\" refers to the pleated or folded appearance of its leaves."
