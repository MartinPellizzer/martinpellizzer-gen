    "intro": "Veronica \u00d7 leiosala, commonly known as the silver veronica, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features silvery-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long blooming period."
