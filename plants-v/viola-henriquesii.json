    "intro": "Viola henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with five petals arranged in a typical violet flower structure. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Viola henriquesii is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
