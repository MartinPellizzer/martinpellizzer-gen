    "intro": "Vincetoxicum volubile f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed species. It is a trailing or climbing perennial plant characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the typical form, giving it a distinct appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and along garden borders, where it can become invasive if not managed."
