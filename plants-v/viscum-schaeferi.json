It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum schaeferi is native to Australia and is an important component of the ecosystems where it grows."
