    "intro": "Vitis davidi var. brachytricha, commonly known as the short-stalked fox grape, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variety of the grapevine. It is native to China and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered fruits. The plant typically produces small, dark berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is not widely available in commercial horticulture."
