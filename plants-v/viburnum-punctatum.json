    "intro": "Viburnum punctatum, commonly known as the spotted viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Its foliage turns a striking orange-red in the autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Viburnum punctatum is valued for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
