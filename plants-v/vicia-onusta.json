    "intro": "Vicia onusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows. Vicia onusta has been used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation in agricultural settings."
