    "intro": "Vulpia setacea, commonly known as the tufted fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often produce dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, two-rowed spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. Vulpia setacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a soil stabilizer."
