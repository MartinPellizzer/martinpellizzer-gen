    "intro": "Ventilago oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved velvetleaf, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its oblong, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. Ventilago oblongifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
