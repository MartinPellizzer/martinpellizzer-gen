    "intro": "Viburnum tomentosum f. plenum, commonly known as the full-leaf snowball viburnum, is a cultivar characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its profuse display of white, clustered flowers. This plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically larger and more densely packed than those of the typical species, giving it a fuller appearance. The flowers appear in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, creating a striking visual contrast. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of garden conditions."
