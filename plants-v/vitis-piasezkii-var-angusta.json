    "intro": "Vitis piasezkii var. angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf muscadine vine, is a member of the Vitaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other muscadine varieties. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to dark purple to black berries in the fall. Its berries are edible, though they are often less flavorful compared to other muscadine grapes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in local horticulture and agriculture."
