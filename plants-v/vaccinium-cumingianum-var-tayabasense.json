It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. These flowers give way to berries that are initially green and mature to a dark purple or black hue. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories in mountainous regions."
