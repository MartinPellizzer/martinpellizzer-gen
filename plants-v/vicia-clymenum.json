    "intro": "Vicia clymenum, commonly known as the common vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It has small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Vicia clymenum is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
