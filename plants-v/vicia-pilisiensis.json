    "intro": "Vicia pilisiensis, commonly known as the Pilis vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by slender, twisted pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Vicia pilisiensis is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for certain insect species."
