    "intro": "Viburnum odoratissimum var. serratum, commonly known as the fragrant snowball viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing in rounded, snowball-like inflorescences. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its specific epithet \"serratum.\" It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. The berries that follow the flowers are dark blue and edible, providing food for birds and wildlife."
