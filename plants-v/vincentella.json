    "intro": "Vincentella, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of a single species, Vincentella monophylla, native to the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy, green leaves that are typically heart-shaped. It produces a spadix, a type of inflorescence, surrounded by a spathe, which is a modified leaf. Vincentella is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
