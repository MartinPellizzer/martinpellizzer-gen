    "intro": "Vinticena sely, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Vinticena sely is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
