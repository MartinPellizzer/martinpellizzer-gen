    "intro": "Veronica verna var. multicaulis, commonly known as the early veronica, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical name reflects its early flowering habit and the presence of multiple stems, which distinguish it from other Veronica species."
