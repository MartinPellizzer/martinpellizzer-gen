    "intro": "Vernonia acrophila, commonly known as the mountain vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at altitudes above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The showy yellow flowers appear in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
