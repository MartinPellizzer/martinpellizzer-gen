    "intro": "Viscum nudum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees such as oaks and apple trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing the seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees. Viscum nudum has a long history of cultural and traditional significance in various parts of Europe."
