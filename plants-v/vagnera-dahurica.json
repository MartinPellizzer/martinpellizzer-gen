    "intro": "Vagnera dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Its flowering period is brief but visually impactful, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vagnera dahurica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cool, moist conditions."
