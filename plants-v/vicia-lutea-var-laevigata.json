    "intro": "Vicia lutea var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth yellow vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with smooth, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
