    "intro": "Valerianella multidentata, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive notched or toothed margin, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along pathways. Valerianella multidentata is also known for its mild, slightly peppery taste, making it a popular edible plant in some regions."
