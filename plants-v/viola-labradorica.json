    "intro": "Viola labradorica, commonly known as Labrador violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, downy coating. Viola labradorica is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
