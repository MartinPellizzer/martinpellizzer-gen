    "intro": "Verbascum samniticum, commonly known as the Southern mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose, branched inflorescence. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Verbascum samniticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
