    "intro": "Valeriana triplinervis var. pinnata, commonly known as the three-veined valerian with pinnate leaves, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its tropical habitat, with specialized root systems and leaf morphology."
