    "intro": "Vanillosma argyrophylla, commonly known as the silver-leafed vanilla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and fragrant vanilla-scented flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight. The orchid produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by the development of fleshy, red berries."
