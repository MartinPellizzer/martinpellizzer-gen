It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, purple to blue flower heads. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
