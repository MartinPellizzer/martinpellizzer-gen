    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. bicolor, commonly known as the pink muscat grape, is a unique variety of grape characterized by its distinctive pink or reddish hues in both the berries and the foliage. This cultivar is a hybrid of Vitis vinifera and Vitis labrusca, resulting in its unique coloration and flavor profile. The leaves are typically larger and more lobed compared to standard Vitis vinifera, and the fruit has a sweet, muscat-like aroma with a balance of acidity and sugar. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and as a specialty wine and table grape. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
