    "intro": "Valerianella fagopyrum, commonly known as common sorrel, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and have a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodland edges and stream banks. It is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, slightly sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Valerianella fagopyrum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
