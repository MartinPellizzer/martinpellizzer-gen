    "intro": "Vismia reticulata, commonly known as the African starwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, star-shaped fruits. Its roots contain compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Vismia reticulata is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
