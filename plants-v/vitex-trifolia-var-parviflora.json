    "intro": "Vitex trifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and small, fragrant, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
