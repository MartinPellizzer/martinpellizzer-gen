    "intro": "Vriesea vagans, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that can display a range of hues, including red, orange, yellow, and green. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, strap-like leaves that collect water, which is used for both hydration and nourishment. Its growth habit allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Vriesea vagans is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
