    "intro": "Vaccinium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal areas of southern California. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are oval and dark green, with a leathery texture, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in maritime environments. The fruit, which is small and acidic, is not typically consumed by humans but is used by wildlife."
