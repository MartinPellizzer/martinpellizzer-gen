    "intro": "Viola kjellbergii, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Viola kjellbergii is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
