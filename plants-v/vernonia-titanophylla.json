    "intro": "Vernonia titanophylla, commonly known as the giant ironweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems that can reach heights of up to 12 feet, making it one of the tallest members of the sunflower family. The plant produces showy, dark purple to black flower heads that are surrounded by pale green bracts, creating a dramatic visual effect. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a rough, hairy texture. Vernonia titanophylla thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds."
