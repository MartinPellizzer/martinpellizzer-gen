    "intro": "Vicia sericocarpa subsp. mollis, commonly known as the silky vetch, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being hairy and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
