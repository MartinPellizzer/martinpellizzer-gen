    "intro": "Vanilla wightii, commonly known as the Wight's vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Southeast Asia. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by fleshy, red-brown pods containing the seeds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Its vanilla-like scent is a characteristic feature, though it is not used commercially for vanilla flavoring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
