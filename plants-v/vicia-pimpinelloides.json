    "intro": "Vicia pimpinelloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow pea-like flowers, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Vicia pimpinelloides is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
