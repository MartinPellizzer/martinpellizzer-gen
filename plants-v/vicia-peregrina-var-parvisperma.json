    "intro": "Vicia peregrina var. parvisperma, commonly known as the small-seeded vetch, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems with alternate pinnate leaves composed of 6\u201312 small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This variety is distinguished by its smaller seeds compared to other Vicia species, making it a unique subject of botanical study."
