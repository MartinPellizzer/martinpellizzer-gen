    "intro": "Veronica minuta, commonly known as the lesser speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy as well. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Veronica minuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
