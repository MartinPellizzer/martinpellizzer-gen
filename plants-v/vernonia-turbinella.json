    "intro": "Vernonia turbinella, commonly known as the turbanflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, turban-shaped flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Vernonia turbinella is an important plant for pollinators and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
