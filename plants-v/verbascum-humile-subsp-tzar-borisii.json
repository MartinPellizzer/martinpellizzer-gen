    "intro": "Verbascum humile subsp. tzar-borisii, commonly known as the Tzar Borisii mullein, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features soft, fuzzy gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates."
