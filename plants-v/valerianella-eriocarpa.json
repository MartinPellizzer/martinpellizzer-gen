    "intro": "Valerianella eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy valerian or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pinkish-white flowers and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Valerianella eriocarpa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
