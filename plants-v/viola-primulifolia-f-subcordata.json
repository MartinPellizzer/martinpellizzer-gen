    "intro": "Viola primulifolia f. subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate violet, is a flowering plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly rounded leaf base, which sets it apart from other viola varieties."
