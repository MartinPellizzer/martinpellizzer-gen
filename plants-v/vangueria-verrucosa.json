    "intro": "Vangueria verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly vangueria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, contributing to its unique texture. Vangueria verrucosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
