    "intro": "Verbesina latisquama, commonly known as the broad-leafed beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its stout, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Verbesina latisquama is adapted to thrive in full sun and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks."
