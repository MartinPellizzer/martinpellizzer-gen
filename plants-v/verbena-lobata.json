    "intro": "Verbena lobata, commonly known as sticky verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a sticky texture, which gives it its common name. Verbena lobata is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive floral display."
