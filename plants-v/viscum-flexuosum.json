    "intro": "Viscum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces sticky berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. Viscum flexuosum is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
