    "intro": "Valerianella trigonocarpa, commonly known as the three-angled valerian, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
