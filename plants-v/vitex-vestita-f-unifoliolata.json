    "intro": "Vitex vestita f. unifoliolata, commonly known as the single-leaf vitex, is a compact shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring single, heart-shaped leaves that are opposite on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
