    "intro": "Vossia, commonly known as the \"whisk fern,\" is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Vossiaceae. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and roots, instead having a central stem with small, scale-like structures called rhizomes. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Vossia species are known for their unique reproductive structures, including sporangia that produce spores. These plants play a minor but ecologically significant role in their native habitats."
