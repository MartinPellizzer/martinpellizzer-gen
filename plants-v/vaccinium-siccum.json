    "intro": "Vaccinium siccum, commonly known as the dry blueberry, is a shrub native to the arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It produces small, dark blue berries that are typically dried for use in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant thrives in cold climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Vaccinium siccum plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
