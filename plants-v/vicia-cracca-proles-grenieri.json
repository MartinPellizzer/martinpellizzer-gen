    "intro": "Vicia cracca proles grenieri, commonly known as the Greenland vetch, is a perennial legume native to northern regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arctic and alpine environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor habitats."
